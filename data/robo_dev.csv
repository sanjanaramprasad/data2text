|PUNCHLINE_TEXT health risk appraisal, when accompanied by feedback counseling, was an effective health promotion tool to help prevent nonsmokers from acquiring the habit and to modify cigarette smoking behavior among college freshmen. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT during treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT seventeen percent of the smokers enrolled in the clinics had reports of having quit smoking for at least the last 30 days at 3-month follow-up (5 months after the program quit day),

","complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and cbt. we await results of recent trials of not on tobacco trials and more data is needed on sustained quitting that allows for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. there were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. there continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.

","overall, there is preliminary evidence that a variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used with children and adolescents to successfully manage or reduce pain and distress associated with needle-related procedures. however, many of the included studies received lower quality scores because they failed to describe the randomization procedure and participant withdrawals or drop-outs from the study. further rcts need to be conducted, particularly for the many interventions for which we could not locate any trials.

","there was evidence individual tfcbt, emdr, stress management and group tfcbt are effective in the treatment of ptsd. other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce ptsd symptoms as significantly. there was some evidence that individual tfcbt and emdr are superior to stress management in the treatment of ptsd at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that tfcbt, emdr and stress management were more effective than other therapies. there was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. there was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. the considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT for boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among time 1 ever smokers, both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78, 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18, 2.23), respectively], and the two estimates were not significantly different. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the most important predictor of smoking for boys, having a best friend who smoked, was significant on application of the chi 2 test (p 0.037), although it was non-significant when included singly in a logistic regression model (0.094); the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the california tobacco surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the more advertisements identified at baseline, the greater was the risk of being a smoker (p<0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% cl, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% cl, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour, beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for each 1-sd increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category, with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among non-smokers, the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke, the belief that smoking is fun, peers, siblings and mother consumption, and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among the cohort, baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, p = 0.0001), brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86, p = 0.0004), and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87, p = 0.0002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significant interaction effects between pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on smoking susceptibility were found. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT less than 5% (n=92) at baseline possessed a promotional item but a further 10%(n=172) were willing to use an item. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for white (susceptibility and ever smoking) and african american (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for hispanic adolescents. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT adjusting for multiple risk factors, the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week), and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT this study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among experimental smokers, the majority (64%) were receptive to

","longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. based on the strength and specificity of this association, evidence of a dose-response relationship, the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke.

","cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review. this may be because of the small size of the studies, lack of standardized assessment and lack of objective determinants of improvement in hirsutism. the endocrinological effects of the different drug therapies reflect the mode of action. larger carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between drug therapies for hirsutism.

","although statistically significant, the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief, disability and quality of life. moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. the primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.

","from this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that smbg affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. more research is needed to explore the psychological impact of smbg and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of smbg on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.

no significant difference in change in leg extensor power, or any other outcome measure, in the es group compared to usual care controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT within the intervention group, improvements in

and less likely to need high-level care (36.8 compared with 56%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT some improvements in strength persisted during 3-months follow-up while other strength variables and functional

force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT quadriceps training resulted in a greater increase in elderly mobility scale score compared with standard rehabilitation (between-group difference of 2.5 (95% ci 1.1,3.8) at week 6 and 1.9 (0.4,3.4) at week 16). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were significantly better results for the patients

","behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of sti transmission can be effective, primarily at encouraging condom use. future evaluations should include a greater focus on hpv and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change, rates of hpv infection and progression to cervical cancer. studies should use an rct design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. given the predominance of usa studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.

","there is some evidence that a vein cuff at the distal anastomosis site improves primary graft patency rates for below knee ptfe graft, but this does not reduce the risk of limb loss. evidence for this beneficial effect of vein cuffed ptfe grafts is weak and based on an underpowered trial. pre-cuffed ptfe grafts have comparable patency and limb salvage rates to vein cuff ptfe grafts. the use of spliced veins improved secondary patency but this did not translate into improved limb salvage. the use of an avf alone showed no added benefits. a large study with a specific focus on below knee vein cuff prosthetic grafts, including ptfe, is required.

","prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic utis over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent utis. the addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent utis, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing utis in three small studies. given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing uti is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of utis. other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.

prevalences were 35% in the intervention colleges and 16% in the control colleges when subjects with unknown quit status were defined as nonquitters. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (> or = 6-month) abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (st) users. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT prolonged abstinence from all tobacco was 6.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 3 months and 9.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 6 months in manual only and telephone counseling, respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT few adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment (9% (19) and 4% (9), respectively), and serious adverse events occurred in two (1%) and three (1%) participants, respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the intervention was significantly effective in preventing incident st use but did not significantly increase cessation beyond that seen in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a significantly higher proportion of subjects randomized to the intervention quit tobacco at each time point compared to the comparison group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a higher percentage of baseline nonsmoking st users reported smoking at follow-up than baseline non-st-using smokers who reported using st. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significant differences were observed in abstinence rates between the two groups at 3 or 6 months. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT long-term success was defined as no smokeless tobacco use at both 3- and 12-month follow-ups, with those lost to follow-up counted as smokeless tobacco users. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT we conclude that a tailored, interactive web-assisted cessation program can be an efficacious method for assisting adult st users to quit. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the cessation rates for active and placebo patch were not significantly different (exact two sided p = 0.22), while the combined patch groups had a significantly greater cessation rate than usual care (exact two sided p = 0.04). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the difference in relapse (no chewing for 7 consecutive days) between the active patch group (33%) and placebo group (48%) was significant at 6 months (p = .003). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT self-reported rates of sustained abstinence (no tobacco use at two months and six months) were 24.5% for the manual/video condition, and 18.4%, for the lifesign condition. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the authors found that the dental hygienist-delivered intervention was effective in getting smokeless tobacco users to quit at three and 12 months and to sustain abstinence at both three and 12 months. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT significant between-group differences were not found for either the 12- or 18-month point-prevalence measure of abstinence from either slt only or all tobacco products using outcomes based on either the responder or intention-to-treat outcomes. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the results showed that the nicotine patch was effective in increasing short-term abstinence over the placebo patch and in reducing craving and withdrawal signs and symptoms from spit tobacco. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no significant difference between groups in the prevalence of st initiation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT three- and 6-month follow-up contacts found that the cessation rates reported by intervention participants were double those reported by participants receiving usual care (41% vs. 17% at 3 months, 37% vs. 19% at 6 months). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT after 7 weeks of medication, subjects on bupropion reported significantly less (p< or = 0.034) nicotine withdrawal than placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rates did not differ between bupropion sr and placebo at the end treatment (53.1% versus 46.4%; odds ratio (or) 1.3; p=0.301). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT survival curve analysis showed that any of the 3 treatment groups involving group behavioral therapy or placebo gum were

","compared to no intervention or minimal interventions (pamphlets, usual care), interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. compared to in-person interventions, interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. the amount of additional weight loss, however, is relatively small and of brief duration, making the clinical significance of these differences unclear.

","improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. the effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in sga infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. if so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated.

","no effect was shown for specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia and death from pneumonia. an effect was shown for the non-specific outcomes of ili, gp consultations for ili and all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. these non-specific outcomes are difficult to interpret because ili includes many pathogens, and winter influenza contributes < 10% to all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. the key interest is preventing laboratory-proven influenza in individuals ≥ 60, pneumonia and deaths from pneumonia, and we cannot draw such conclusions. the identified studies are at high risk of bias. some hcws remain unvaccinated because they do not perceive risk, doubt vaccine efficacy and are concerned about side effects. this review did not find information on co-interventions with hcw vaccination: hand washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, anti-virals, and asking hcws with ili not to work. we conclude there is no evidence that vaccinating hcws prevents influenza in elderly residents in ltcfs. high quality rcts are required to avoid risks of bias in methodology and conduct, and to test these interventions in combination.

","available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing hiv and the incidence of stis amongst female sex workers (fsws). given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing hiv/sti and the public health need to control transmission amongst fsws, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. however, it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and that all of the trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries.

","generally, fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid, and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. however, we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time, and many studies were small. policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. there is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin, remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. however, the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings.

","medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. the greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the ssris in treating paediatric ocd. there is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. as quantitative data was only available for the ssris and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended, especially given concerns of dependency and treatment -related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. future rcts could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment, optimal dosage, as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted.

","this review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of ccpt over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. there was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately-powered, long-term trials.

analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (p = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT water in homes was contaminated (43.4%) with more than 1100 total coliforms/100 ml due to the use of unclean utensils to transport and store water. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among the 108 children in households allocated solar treatment, diarrhoea was reported in 439 of the 2-week reporting periods during the 12-week trial (average 4.1 [sd 1.2] per child). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT diarrhoea rates were not significantly different among the participants while exposed to water treated with hypochlorite. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in unannounced evaluations of home drinking water, free chlorine was detected in samples from 27% of flocculant-disinfectant households, 35% of flocculant-disinfectant plus vessel households, 35% of bleach households, and 43% of bleach plus vessel households. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT children drinking solar disinfected water had a significantly lower risk of severe diarrhoeal disease over 8705 two weekly follow up visits; two week period prevalence was 48.8% compared with 58.1% in controls, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 16.0%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT stored water in intervention households was less contaminated with escherichia coli than stored water in control households (p < 0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the results show a 50% reduction of the incidence rate of diarrhoea and a 85% reduction of the proportion of deaths related to diarrhoea in the villages with intervention. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT this intervention is a useful tool for preventing waterborne diseases in families in developing countries who lack access to potable water. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the 1702 people in households receiving the disinfectant had a prevalence of diarrhoea that was 40% lower than that among the 1699 people using standard water-handling practices (0.9% versus 1.5%; p = 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the sws was equally effective with or without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (p = 0.73 for interaction), and together they reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (irr = 0.33, 95% ci = 0.24-0.46, p < 0.0001), days with diarrhea by 54% (irr = 0.46, 95% ci = 0.32-0.66, p < 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea by 47% (irr = 0.53, 95% ci = 0.34-0.83, p < 0.0056). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT this impact was evident throughout the year, but particularly in the monsoon season, and in all age groups except those less than 6 months old. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT an intervention trial with comprehensive prevention and control for diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of east fujian, china during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the home chlorination intervention group had the lowest diarrheal rate (28.8/1,000 subjects/month) despite lack of access to piped water in their homes. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT annual incidence of diarrhoea in 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were 103 episodes of hcgi during 10,790 person-days at risk in the sham group and 82 episodes during 11,380 person-days at risk in the active treatment group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT children under 5 years of age whose families were not using chlorinated water had twice the risk of diarrhoea compared to children from the participating families (odds ratio = 1.98, p = 0.047). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in this study area, under non-epidemic conditions, the reduction of faecal bacteria in the public drinking-water supply by chlorination does not seem to be a priority intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for children less than five years old, the reduction in risk was 83% (95% ci = 51-94%; p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics.

","interventions to improve water quality are generally effective in preventing diarrhoea, and interventions to improve water quality at the household level are more effective than those at the source. significant heterogeneity among the trials suggests that the actual level of effectiveness may depend on a variety of conditions that research to date cannot fully explain. rigorous, blinded, multi-arm randomized controlled trials conducted over a longer duration in a variety if settings may help clarify the potential effectiveness.

","although antibiotic treatment is effective for the cure of urinary tract infections, there are insufficient data to recommend any specific drug regimen for treatment of symptomatic urinary tract infections during pregnancy. all the antibiotics studied were shown to be very effective in decreasing the incidence of the different outcomes. complications were very rare. all included trials had very small sample sizes to reliably detect important differences between treatments. future studies should evaluate the most promising antibiotics, in terms of class, timing, dose, acceptability, maternal and neonatal outcomes and costs.

","there is some evidence that 'adding on' services (or linkages) may improve the utilisation and outputs of healthcare delivery. however, there is no evidence to date that a fuller form of integration improves healthcare delivery or health status. available evidence suggests that full integration probably decreases the knowledge and utilisation of specific services and may not result in any improvements in health status. more rigorous studies of different strategies to promote integration over a wider range of services and settings are needed. these studies should include economic evaluation and the views of clients as clients' views will influence the uptake of integration strategies at the point of delivery and the effectiveness on community health of these strategies.

","calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal sah. the results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. the evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal sah. intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.

","early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with the cognitive benefits persisting into pre-school age. there is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes trialled and gestational ages of the preterm infants included, which limits the comparisons of intervention programmes. further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programmes.

","cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. two open-label trials of varenicline versus nrt suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. the main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out. future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. there is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks.

","stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. there was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. when partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. the no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. the other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention. due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. however, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes.

(28.9%) and 10 (21.7%) patients, respectively, and 5 (11.1%) and 3 (6.5%), respectively, received a new catheter. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significant difference was noted in the incidence of uti (5 vs. 10, p = 0.25), with a trend towards less uti in group 1. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT at follow-up after one year, postoperative bacteriuria was closely correlated to increased rates of both clinical cystitis and asymptomatic significant bacteriuria. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were no statistically significant differences in either the duration of continuous catheter drainage before the return of spontaneous

voids (322 ml compared with 195 ml; p<0.0001) than their counterparts in the 0600 group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT catheter removal on day 1 led to a significantly shorter post-operative hospital stay (2.3 days

","despite reviewing 39 eligible trials, few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered, the small size of individual trials, and their low quality. whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity (especially infection) and risks of recatheterisation.

","oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. however, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. in addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. one study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza a/h1n1. the benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. however, the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is still uncertain. larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission), particularly in 'at risk' groups.

","cabg is associated with reduced rates of major adverse cardiac events, mostly driven by reduced repeat revascularisation. however, the rct data are limited by follow-up, unrepresentative samples and rapid development of both surgical techniques and stenting. research on real-world patient population or patient level data meta-analyses may identify risk factors and groupings who may benefit most from one strategy over the other.

","the available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. however, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. antidepressants are not widely supported for bpd treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. total bpd severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. no promising results are available for the core bpd symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the rct evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).

","breathing exercises over four to 15 weeks improve functional exercise capacity in people with copd compared to no intervention; however, there are no consistent effects on dyspnoea or health-related quality of life. outcomes were similar across all the breathing exercises examined. treatment effects for patient-reported outcomes may have been overestimated owing to lack of blinding. breathing exercises may be useful to improve exercise tolerance in selected individuals with copd who are unable to undertake exercise training; however, these data do not suggest a widespread role for breathing exercises in the comprehensive management of people with copd.

","our review update included data from four new randomised studies of the ketogenic diet. although none were blinded, some were of good quality. these studies suggest that in children, the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control, the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. however, one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. this would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. the main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. we found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. there has been less research involving other diets. we found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the atkins diet. this study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. for those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable, a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control, but tolerability is poor. one observational study suggested that the atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control, but this requires more investigation.

","evidence suggests that risperidone and olanzapine are useful in reducing aggression and risperidone reduces psychosis, but both are associated with serious adverse cerebrovascular events and extrapyramidal symptoms. despite the modest efficacy, the significant increase in adverse events confirms that neither risperidone nor olanzapine should be used routinely to treat dementia patients with aggression or psychosis unless there is severe distress or risk of physical harm to those living and working with the patient. although insufficient data were available from the considered trials, a meta-analysis of seventeen placebo controlled trials of atypical neuroleptics for the treatment of behavioural symptoms in people with dementia conducted by the food and drug administration suggested a significant increase in mortality (or 1.7). a peer-reviewed meta-analysis (schneider 2005) of 15 placebo controlled studies (nine unpublished) found similarly increased risk in mortality (or=1.54, 95% ci 0.004 to 0.02, p=0.01) for the atypical neuroleptics.

","the included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels, together with a small increase in haemoglobin, in patients with ckd who were treated with iv iron compared with oral iron. from a limited body of evidence, we identified a significant reduction in esa requirements in patients treated with iv iron, and found no significant difference in mortality. adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. we therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of iv iron is justified on the basis of reductions in esa dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects.

","the range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. there are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. a vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. as the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.

size, the main finding in the trial is clear-cut; loestrin-20 provides poor cycle control and is thus less acceptable as an oral contraceptive than microgynon-30. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT analysis of results revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to the plasma levels of hdl-cholesterol and its subfractions, ldl-cholesterol and apolipoproteins. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT most mean changes from baseline laboratory values were comparable between groups, although the mean increase in cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly lower in the levonorgestrel with ethinyl estradiol group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT women using the 21/7-day ocp had significantly fewer episodes of unscheduled bleeding than did those using the 24/4-day ocp (mean 1.47 compared with 2.01, p=.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT however, discontinuation rates for medical reasons differed significantly between the treatment groups, with the preparation containing 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and that containing 400 micrograms norethisterone acetate being associated with higher discontinuation rates due to bleeding disturbances. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT irregular bleeding (break-through bleeding or spotting) was significantly more frequent with the 150/20 combination in about two-thirds of the cycles randomly distributed over the one year of the study. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the discontinuation rate due to adverse events, including intermenstrual bleeding, was low (9.8% for 20 micrograms ee2 + 75 micrograms gsd, and 7.2% for 30 micrograms ee2 + 75 micrograms gsd) and was in the lower range known for other oral contraceptives. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT breakthrough bleeding and spotting was reported by a significantly lower percentage of participants in the ortho tri-cyclen lo group compared with the loestrin fe 1/20 group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT from the study, it was demonstrated that the two regimens had no difference in cycle control, efficacy, and side effects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the median values for the fasting levels of insulin, c-peptide and free fatty acids slightly increased or remained unchanged while the fasting glucose levels slightly decreased after 13 treatment cycles. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a total of 1,850 cycles were completed and analyzed for efficacy, side effects, metabolic changes, and cycle control. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT bloating, breast tenderness, and nausea were approximately 50% more common in women using 35 micrograms ee as compared to 20 micrograms ee preparations. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the changes in the hemostatic variables for drsp/20ee were less pronounced compared to dsg/30ee and drsp/30ee. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no clinically significant differences were noted in weight, blood pressure, papanicolaou smears or laboratory data. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in both groups, there was a significant increase in triglycerides, hdl-cholesterol and apoprotein a1; the same increase was observed for sbp and cbg. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both study treatments were safe and well tolerated by the volunteers as shown by the nature and frequency of adverse events, the routine laboratory examinations, and the physical and gynecological examinations. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the incidence of adverse events in all treatment groups was similar, with the exception of metrorrhagia, which occurred in more patients in the desogestrel group than in the gestodene treatment groups (p < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT withdrawal bleeding characteristics were comparable between the two groups, except for the length of the latent period, which was significantly longer in the lng/ee group.

","while cocs containing 20 μg ee may be theoretically safer, this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. low-dose estrogen cocs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. however, most trials compared cocs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.

","repetitive task training resulted in modest improvement in lower limb function, but not upper limb function. training may be sufficient to impact on daily living function. however, there is no evidence that improvements are sustained once training has ended. the review potentially investigates task specificity rather more than repetition. further research should focus on the type and amount of training, and how to maintain functional gain.

","methotrexate may have a small steroid sparing effect in adults with asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids. however, the overall reduction in daily steroid use is probably not large enough to reduce steroid-induced adverse effects. this small potential to reduce the impact of steroid side-effects is probably insufficient to offset the adverse effects of methotrexate.

","we do not know whether pq added to treatment regimens for patients with p. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. in individual patients, it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. in practical terms, even if pq results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria, there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community, where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. since pq is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes, there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. in terms of harms, there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where g6pd deficiency occurs. in light of these doubts about safety, and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission, countries should question whether to continue to use pq routinely in primary treatment of malaria. further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for pq in malaria elimination, or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment.

","the findings of this review suggest that oral naltrexone did not perform better than treatment with placebo or no pharmacological agent with respect to the number of participants re-incarcerated during the study period. if oral naltrexone is compared with other pharmacological treatments such as benzodiazepine and buprenorphine, no statistically significant difference was found. the percentage of people retained in treatment in the included studies is however low (28%). the conclusion of this review is that the studies conducted have not allowed an adequate evaluation of oral naltrexone treatment in the field of opioid dependence. consequently, maintenance therapy with naltrexone cannot yet be considered a treatment which has been scientifically proved to be superior to other kinds of treatment.

","although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with uti, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower uti. this review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. no differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. this data adds to an existing cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

","gtr has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. however there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. as a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of gtr. whilst there is evidence that gtr can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the consort statement both in their conduct and reporting. there is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. the priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.

","if we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. to help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.

","the most likely effective treatment to slow myopia progression thus far is anti-muscarinic topical medication. however, side effects of these medications include light sensitivity and near blur. also, they are not yet commercially available, so their use is limited and not practical. further information is required for other methods of myopia control, such as the use of corneal reshaping contact lenses or bifocal soft contact lenses (bscls) with a distance center are promising, but currently no published randomized clinical trials exist.

","although numerous studies have been undertaken, there is a noticeable inconsistency of the findings of the available studies and this is confounded by serious methodological issues within the included studies. the body of evidence in this review does not support the hypothesis that multi-component community wide interventions effectively increase population levels of physical activity. there is a clear need for well-designed intervention studies and such studies should focus on the quality of the measurement of physical activity, the frequency of measurement and the allocation to intervention and control communities.

","the review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions based largely on trials with no treatment controls. there is little information concerning acceptability of treatment or possible side effects in the included trials. given the relatively poor quality of most of the included studies and the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of effect, there remains a need for further trials. it is important that these trials should be of high quality and include assessment of potential adverse effects.

","although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. the efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. one of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. it is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. an additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention. note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

","on the basis of one randomised trial which did not describe its methodology in sufficient detail to assess risk of bias and quality, excluded 27% of patients after randomisation due to various reasons, and is probably not free from selective outcome reporting bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in patients with colonic cancer liver metastases, electro-coagulation alone brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with the control. in addition, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of adding allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide to electro-coagulation. the probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. more randomised trials are needed in order to sufficiently validate electro-coagulation with or without co-interventions.

","ivig administration results in a 3% reduction in sepsis and a 4% reduction in one or more episodes of any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in other clinically important outcomes, including mortality. prophylactic use of ivig is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. the decision to use prophylactic ivig will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. there is no justification for conducting additional rcts to test the efficacy of previously studied ivig preparations in reducing nosocomial infections in preterm and/or lbw infants.

","limited data on the effect of ß-interferon treatment on ppms exists. only two single-centre placebo controlled trials of interferon beta have been done. based on this review, the included studies showed that ß-interferon treatment was not associated with reduced disability progression in ppms patients. however, the trial population was too small to allow definitive conclusions on the efficacy of ß-interferon therapy in ppms patients. larger research studies need to be done in patients with ppms in order to clarify whether ß-interferon is effective in this population.

","the potential benefit of antibiotics in the treatment of clinically diagnosed acute rhinosinusitis needs to be seen in the context of a high prevalence of adverse events. taking into account antibiotic resistance and the very low incidence of serious complications, we conclude that there is no place for antibiotics for the patient with clinically diagnosed, uncomplicated acute rhinosinusitis. this review cannot make recommendations for children, patients with a suppressed immune system and patients with severe disease, as these populations were not included in the available trials.

","implications for practice oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. oral bo and epo are not effective treatments for eczema. in these studies, along with the placebos, epo and bo have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal. the short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of epo or bo. a case report warned that if epo is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that epo may increase bleeding for people on coumadin® (warfarin) medication. implications for research noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on epo or bo for eczema would be hard to justify. this review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.

","the value of the various approaches to conservative management of postprostatectomy incontinence after radical prostatectomy remains uncertain. it seems unlikely that men benefit from one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training therapy after transurethral resection of the prostate (turp). long-term incontinence may be managed by external penile clamp, but there are safety problems.
