","two trials are included in this review but no conclusions can be drawn for the benefit of co-acupressure for slowing progress of myopia in children. further evidence in the form of rcts are needed before any recommendations can be made for the use of acupuncture treatment in clinical use. these trials should compare acupuncture to placebo and have large sample sizes. other types of acupuncture (such as auricular acupuncture) should be explored further as well as compliance with treatment for at least six months or longer. axial length elongation of the eye should be investigated for at least one year. the potential to reduce/eliminate pain from acupuncture experienced by children should also be reviewed.

","simple advice has a small effect on cessation rates. assuming an unassisted quit rate of 2 to 3%, a brief advice intervention can increase quitting by a further 1 to 3%. additional components appear to have only a small effect, though there is a small additional benefit of more intensive interventions compared to very brief interventions.

","two intervention types, the specialist epilepsy nurse and self-management education, have some evidence of benefit. however, we did not find clear evidence that other service models substantially improve outcomes for adults with epilepsy. it is also possible that benefits are situation specific and may not generalise to other settings. these studies included only a small number of service providers whose individual competence or expertise may have had a significant impact on outcomes. at present it is not possible to advocate any single model of service provision.

","complex approaches show promise, with some persistence of abstinence (30 days point prevalence abstinence or continuous abstinence at six months), especially those incorporating elements sensitive to stage of change and using motivational enhancement and cbt. we await results of recent trials of not on tobacco trials and more data is needed on sustained quitting that allows for the episodic nature of much adolescent smoking. there were few trials with evidence about pharmacological interventions (nicotine replacement and bupropion), and none demonstrated effectiveness for adolescent smokers. there is not yet sufficient evidence to recommend widespread implementation of any one model. there continues to be a need for well-designed adequately powered randomized controlled trials of interventions for this population of smokers.

","overall, there is preliminary evidence that a variety of cognitive-behavioral interventions can be used with children and adolescents to successfully manage or reduce pain and distress associated with needle-related procedures. however, many of the included studies received lower quality scores because they failed to describe the randomization procedure and participant withdrawals or drop-outs from the study. further rcts need to be conducted, particularly for the many interventions for which we could not locate any trials.

","there was evidence individual tfcbt, emdr, stress management and group tfcbt are effective in the treatment of ptsd. other non-trauma focused psychological treatments did not reduce ptsd symptoms as significantly. there was some evidence that individual tfcbt and emdr are superior to stress management in the treatment of ptsd at between 2 and 5 months following treatment, and also that tfcbt, emdr and stress management were more effective than other therapies. there was insufficient evidence to determine whether psychological treatment is harmful. there was some evidence of greater drop-out in active treatment groups. the considerable unexplained heterogeneity observed in these comparisons, and the potential impact of publication bias on these data, suggest the need for caution in interpreting the results of this review.

","longitudinal studies consistently suggest that exposure to tobacco advertising and promotion is associated with the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke. based on the strength and specificity of this association, evidence of a dose-response relationship, the consistency of findings across numerous observational studies, temporality of exposure and smoking behaviours observed, as well as the theoretical plausibility regarding the impact of advertising, we conclude that tobacco advertising and promotion increases the likelihood that adolescents will start to smoke.

","diflunisal has an analgesic effect similar to other nsaids in single dose, but benefits from providing significant analgesia for about twelve hours. this property may be useful when regular dosing is needed, or when taking several doses of a shorter acting analgesic is impractical.

","cyproterone acetate combined with estradiol results in a subjective improvement in hirsutism compared to placebo. clinical differences in outcome between cyproterone acetate and other medical therapies were not demonstrated in the studies included in this review. this may be because of the small size of the studies, lack of standardized assessment and lack of objective determinants of improvement in hirsutism. the endocrinological effects of the different drug therapies reflect the mode of action. larger carefully designed studies are needed to compare efficacy and safety profiles between drug therapies for hirsutism.

","inhaled antibiotic treatment probably improves lung function and reduces exacerbation rate, but a pooled estimate of the level of benefit is not possible. the best evidence is for inhaled tobramycin. more evidence, from trials of longer duration, is needed to determine whether this benefit is maintained and to determine the significance of development of antibiotic-resistant organisms.

","we could not identify an antibiotic adjuvant therapy that could be recommended for the treatment of lung infection in those with cystic fibrosis. the emergence of increasingly resistant bacteria makes the reliance on antibiotics alone challenging for cystic fibrosis teams. there is a need to explore alternative strategies, such as the use of adjuvant therapies. further research is required to provide future therapeutic options.

","we are not confident that cross-over studies are appropriate for this participant group as they are best for conditions that are stable and for interventions with no physiological and psychological carry-over. sildenafil may be a useful option in the treatment of antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction in men with schizophrenia, but this conclusion is based only on one small short trial. switching to olanzapine may improve sexual functioning in men and women, but the trial assessing this was a small, open label trial. further well designed randomised control trials that are blinded and well conducted and reported, which investigate the effects of dose reduction, drug holidays, symptomatic therapy and switching antipsychotic on sexual function in people with antipsychotic-induced sexual dysfunction are urgently needed.

","there is good evidence that cementing the prostheses in place will reduce post-operative pain and lead to better mobility. from the trials to date there is no evidence of any difference in outcome between bipolar and unipolar prosthesis. there is some evidence that a total hip replacement leads to better functional outcome than a hemiarthroplasty. further well-conducted randomised trials are required.

","the evidence in this review does not support the use of prophylactic maternal phenobarbital administration to prevent pvh in preterm infants or to protect them from neurological disability in childhood. phenobarbital administration may lead to maternal sedation. if any future trials are carried out, they should measure neurodevelopmental status at follow up.

","in experienced hands, ultrasound provides at least as good success rates as other methods of peripheral nerve location. individual studies have demonstrated that ultrasound may reduce complication rates and improve quality, performance time, and time to onset of blocks. due to wide variations in study outcomes we chose not to combine the studies in our analysis.

","for the considered outcomes, it seems that adding any psychosocial support to standard maintenance treatments do not add additional benefits. data do not show differences also for contingency approaches, contrary to all expectations. duration of the studies was too short to analyse relevant outcomes such as mortality. it should be noted that the control intervention used in the studies included in the review on maintenance treatments, is a program that routinely offers counselling sessions in addition to methadone; thus the review, actually, did not evaluate the question of whether any ancillary psychosocial intervention is needed when methadone maintenance is provided, but the narrower question of whether a specific more structured intervention provides any additional benefit to a standard psychosocial support. these interventions probably can be measured and evaluated by employing diverse criteria for evaluating treatment outcomes, aimed to rigorously assess changes in emotional, interpersonal, vocational and physical health areas of life functioning.

","as a result of the few available studies, no convincing conclusions can be formulated about the effectiveness of workplace interventions on work-related outcomes and health outcomes regardless of the type of work disability. the pooled data for the musculoskeletal disorders subgroup indicated that workplace interventions are effective in the reduction of sickness absence, but they are not effective in improving health outcomes. the evidence from the subgroup analysis on musculoskeletal disorders was rated as moderate-quality evidence. unfortunately, conclusions cannot be drawn on the effectiveness of these interventions for mental health problems and other health conditions due to a lack of studies.

","although statistically significant, the differences between disc replacement and conventional fusion surgery for degenerative disc disease were not beyond the generally accepted clinical important differences with respect to short-term pain relief, disability and quality of life. moreover, these analyses only represent a highly selected population. the primary goal of prevention of adjacent level disease and facet joint degeneration by using total disc replacement, as noted by the manufacturers and distributors, was not properly assessed and not a research question at all. unfortunately, evidence from observational studies could not be used because of the high risk of bias, while these could have improved external validity assessment of complications in less selected patient groups. non-randomised studies should however be very clear about patient selection and should incorporate independent, blinded outcome assessment, which was not the case in the excluded studies. therefore, because we believe that harm and complications may occur after years, we believe that the spine surgery community should be prudent about adopting this technology on a large scale, despite the fact that total disc replacement seems to be effective in treating low-back pain in selected patients, and in the short term is at least equivalent to fusion surgery.

","there is significant evidence to suggest that topical application of chlorhexidine to umbilical cord reduces neonatal mortality and omphalitis in community and primary care settings in developing countries. it may increase cord separation time however, there is no evidence that it increases risk of subsequent morbidity or infection. there is insufficient evidence to support the application of an antiseptic to umbilical cord in hospital settings compared with dry cord care in developed countries.

","from this review, we conclude that when diabetes duration is over one year, the overall effect of self-monitoring of blood glucose on glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who are not using insulin is small up to six months after initiation and subsides after 12 months. furthermore, based on a best-evidence synthesis, there is no evidence that smbg affects patient satisfaction, general well-being or general health-related quality of life. more research is needed to explore the psychological impact of smbg and its impact on diabetes specific quality of life and well-being, as well as the impact of smbg on hypoglycaemia and diabetic complications.

","behavioural interventions for young women which aim to promote sexual behaviours protective of sti transmission can be effective, primarily at encouraging condom use. future evaluations should include a greater focus on hpv and its link to cervical cancer, with long-term follow-up to assess impact on behaviour change, rates of hpv infection and progression to cervical cancer. studies should use an rct design where possible with integral process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis where appropriate. given the predominance of usa studies in this systematic review evaluations conducted in other countries would be particularly useful.

","there is some evidence that a vein cuff at the distal anastomosis site improves primary graft patency rates for below knee ptfe graft, but this does not reduce the risk of limb loss. evidence for this beneficial effect of vein cuffed ptfe grafts is weak and based on an underpowered trial. pre-cuffed ptfe grafts have comparable patency and limb salvage rates to vein cuff ptfe grafts. the use of spliced veins improved secondary patency but this did not translate into improved limb salvage. the use of an avf alone showed no added benefits. a large study with a specific focus on below knee vein cuff prosthetic grafts, including ptfe, is required.

","there is inadequate evidence to draw strong conclusions on the efficacy or safety of the drug interventions included in this review. there is some low quality evidence from a meta-analysis of two studies investigating urokinase (various strengths) and some very low evidence from two single studies investigating alteplase 2 mg/2 ml that suggest that these two drug interventions may be effective in treating withdrawal or total occlusion of cvc lumens caused by thrombosis. further high quality, sufficiently powered research is still required to look at the efficacy and safety of urokinase, alteplase and other chemical, surgical and drug interventions for treating cvc lumen occlusion. research studies which exclusively include child participants are especially warranted.

","based on two small trials, there was no significant difference in pain relief in women receiving oral analgesics compared with placebo or no treatment (129 women; md -3.51; 95% ci -10.03 to 3.01). we consider this evidence to be of a low to moderate quality. in routine clinical practice, intracervical injection of local anaesthetic with a vasoconstrictor (lignocaine plus adrenaline or prilocaine plus felypressin) appears to be the optimum analgesia for treatment. however, further high-quality, adequately powered trials should be undertaken in order to provide the data necessary to estimate the efficacy of oral analgesics, the optimal route of administration and dose of local anaesthetics.

","the results of this review give some support to ciclesonide as an equivalent therapy to other ics at similar nominal doses. the studies assessed low doses of steroids, in patients whose asthma required treatment with low doses of steroids. at half the dose of fp and bdp/bud, the effects of ciclesonide were more inconsistent the effect on candidiasis may be of importance to people who find this to be problematic. the role of ciclesonide in the management of asthma requires further study, especially in paediatric patients. further assessment against fp at a dose ratio of 1:2 is a priority.

","treating simple corneal abrasions with a patch does not improve healing rates on the first day post-injury and does not reduce pain. in addition, use of patches results in a loss of binocular vision. therefore it is recommended that patches should not be used for simple corneal abrasions. further research should focus on large (greater than 10 mm2) abrasions.

","prior to the current update it appeared there was some evidence that cranberry juice may decrease the number of symptomatic utis over a 12 month period, particularly for women with recurrent utis. the addition of 14 further studies suggests that cranberry juice is less effective than previously indicated. although some of small studies demonstrated a small benefit for women with recurrent utis, there were no statistically significant differences when the results of a much larger study were included. cranberry products were not significantly different to antibiotics for preventing utis in three small studies. given the large number of dropouts/withdrawals from studies (mainly attributed to the acceptability of consuming cranberry products particularly juice, over long periods), and the evidence that the benefit for preventing uti is small, cranberry juice cannot currently be recommended for the prevention of utis. other preparations (such as powders) need to be quantified using standardised methods to ensure the potency, and contain enough of the 'active' ingredient, before being evaluated in clinical studies or recommended for use.

","continuous monitoring of physiological variables for the first two to three days may improve outcomes and prevent complications. attention to the changes in physiological variables is a key feature of a stroke unit, and can most likely be aided by continuous monitoring without complications related to immobility or to treatments triggered by the relief of abnormal physiological variables. well-designed, high-quality studies are needed because many questions remain open and deserve further research. these include when to start continuous monitoring, when to interrupt it, which people should be given priority, and which treatments are most appropriate after the identification of abnormalities in physiological variables.

","dse may perform better than mps but additional studies directly comparing these cardiac screening tests are needed. absence of significant cad may not necessarily correlate with cardiac-event free survival following transplantation. further research should focus on assessing the ability of functional tests to predict postoperative outcome.

","massage might be beneficial for patients with subacute and chronic non-specific low-back pain, especially when combined with exercises and education. the evidence suggests that acupuncture massage is more effective than classic massage, but this need confirmation. more studies are needed to confirm these conclusions, to assess the impact of massage on return-to-work, and to determine cost-effectiveness of massage as an intervention for low-back pain.

","the overall quality of evidence was moderate. half of these postpartum interventions led to fewer repeat pregnancies or births or more contraceptive use. however, the evidence of intervention effectiveness was of low to moderate quality. trials with evidence of effectiveness included two that provided one or two sessions and three that had multiple contacts. the former had limitations, such as self-reported outcomes and showing no effect for many comparisons. the interventions with multiple sessions were promising but would have to be adapted for other locations and then retested. researchers and health care providers will have to determine which intervention might be appropriate for their setting and level of resources.

","prophylactic systemic antibiotics in neonates with a central venous catheter reduces the rate of proven or suspected septicaemia. however, this may not be clinically important in the face of no significant difference in overall mortality and the lack of data on long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. furthermore, there is a lack of data pertaining to the potentially significant disadvantages of this approach such as the selection of resistant organisms. the routine use of prophylactic antibiotics in infants with central venous catheters in neonatal units cannot currently be recommended.

","compared to no intervention or minimal interventions (pamphlets, usual care), interactive computer-based interventions are an effective intervention for weight loss and weight maintenance. compared to in-person interventions, interactive computer-based interventions result in smaller weight losses and lower levels of weight maintenance. the amount of additional weight loss, however, is relatively small and of brief duration, making the clinical significance of these differences unclear.

","based on this analysis, the most prudent prescription for water intake to premature infants would seem to be careful restriction of water intake so that physiological needs are met without allowing significant dehydration. this practice could be expected to decrease the risks of patent ductus arteriosus and necrotizing enterocolitis without significantly increasing the risk of adverse consequences.

","improvement in control of maternal blood pressure with use of beta-blockers would be worthwhile only if it were reflected in substantive benefits for mother and/or baby, and none have been clearly demonstrated. the effect of beta-blockers on perinatal outcome is uncertain; the worrying trend to an increase in sga infants is partly dependent on one small outlying trial. large randomised trials are needed to determine whether antihypertensive therapy in general (rather than beta-blocker therapy specifically) results in greater benefit than risk, for treatment of mild-moderate pregnancy hypertension. if so, then it would be appropriate to consider which antihypertensive is best, and beta-blockers should be evaluated.

","no effect was shown for specific outcomes: laboratory-proven influenza, pneumonia and death from pneumonia. an effect was shown for the non-specific outcomes of ili, gp consultations for ili and all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. these non-specific outcomes are difficult to interpret because ili includes many pathogens, and winter influenza contributes < 10% to all-cause mortality in individuals ≥ 60. the key interest is preventing laboratory-proven influenza in individuals ≥ 60, pneumonia and deaths from pneumonia, and we cannot draw such conclusions. the identified studies are at high risk of bias. some hcws remain unvaccinated because they do not perceive risk, doubt vaccine efficacy and are concerned about side effects. this review did not find information on co-interventions with hcw vaccination: hand washing, face masks, early detection of laboratory-proven influenza, quarantine, avoiding admissions, anti-virals, and asking hcws with ili not to work. we conclude there is no evidence that vaccinating hcws prevents influenza in elderly residents in ltcfs. high quality rcts are required to avoid risks of bias in methodology and conduct, and to test these interventions in combination.

","available evidence nevertheless suggests that compared with standard care or no intervention, behavioral interventions are effective in reducing hiv and the incidence of stis amongst female sex workers (fsws). given the benefits of social cognitive theory and the promotion of condom use in reducing hiv/sti and the public health need to control transmission amongst fsws, there is a clear finding in favour of behavioral interventions. however, it should be recognized that there is a lack of information about most other outcomes and target populations, and that all of the trials were conducted in low- and middle-income countries.

","this review shows a beneficial effect of ews in time to recurrence, percentage of people hospitalised and functioning in people with bipolar disorder. however, the absence of data on the primary outcome measure in so many included studies is a source of concern and a potential source of bias. mental health services should consider routinely providing ews interventions to adults with bipolar disorder, as they appear to reduce hospitalisation and therefore may be cost-effective.

","this review suggests that the use of fluoride supplements is associated with a reduction in caries increment when compared with no fluoride supplement in permanent teeth. the effect of fluoride supplements was unclear on deciduous teeth. when compared with the administration of topical fluorides, no differential effect was observed. we rated 10 trials as being at unclear risk of bias and one at high risk of bias, and therefore the trials provide weak evidence about the efficacy of fluoride supplements.

","generally, fluoroquinolones performed well in treating typhoid, and maybe superior to alternatives in some settings. however, we were unable to draw firm general conclusions on comparative contemporary effectiveness given that resistance changes over time, and many studies were small. policy makers and clinicians need to consider local resistance patterns in choosing a fluoroquinolone or alternative. there is some evidence that the newest fluoroquinolone, gatifloxacin, remains effective in some regions where resistance to older fluoroquinolones has developed. however, the different fluoroquinolones have not been compared directly in trials in these settings.

","interventions to enhance communication involving children and adolescents with cancer have not been widely or rigorously assessed. the weak evidence that exists suggests that some children and adolescents with cancer may derive some benefit from specific information-giving programs, from support before and during particular procedures, and from interventions that aim to facilitate their reintegration into school and social activities. more research is needed to investigate the effects of these and other related interventions.

","laparoscopic resection of carcinoma of the colon is associated with a long term outcome no different from that of open colectomy. further studies are required to determine whether the incidence of incisional hernias and adhesions is affected by method of approach. laparoscopic surgery for cancer of the upper rectum is feasible, but more randomised trials need to be conducted to assess long term outcome.

","medication treatments can be effective in paediatric anxiety disorders, acting to reduce core symptoms, and should be considered as part of the treatment of these disorders. the greatest number of trials showing efficacy to date have assessed the ssris in treating paediatric ocd. there is no clear evidence to show that any particular class of medication is more effective or better tolerated than any other. as quantitative data was only available for the ssris and venlafaxine the routine use of benzodiazepines cannot be recommended, especially given concerns of dependency and treatment -related emergent adverse events associated with this class of drugs. future rcts could help identify potential clinical moderators of treatment efficacy. studies of the long-term efficacy of medication treatment, optimal dosage, as well as direct comparisons of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy are also warranted.

","the results clearly demonstrate the superiority of antipsychotic drugs compared to placebo in preventing relapse. this effect must be weighed against the side effects of antipsychotic drugs. future studies should focus on outcomes of social participation and clarify the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with these drugs.

","this review was unable to demonstrate any advantage of ccpt over other airway clearance techniques in terms of respiratory function, but this may have reflected insufficient evidence rather than real equivalence between methods. there was a trend for participants to prefer self-administered airway clearance techniques. limitations of this review included a paucity of well-designed, adequately-powered, long-term trials.

","interventions to improve water quality are generally effective in preventing diarrhoea, and interventions to improve water quality at the household level are more effective than those at the source. significant heterogeneity among the trials suggests that the actual level of effectiveness may depend on a variety of conditions that research to date cannot fully explain. rigorous, blinded, multi-arm randomized controlled trials conducted over a longer duration in a variety if settings may help clarify the potential effectiveness.

","there is some evidence that 'adding on' services (or linkages) may improve the utilisation and outputs of healthcare delivery. however, there is no evidence to date that a fuller form of integration improves healthcare delivery or health status. available evidence suggests that full integration probably decreases the knowledge and utilisation of specific services and may not result in any improvements in health status. more rigorous studies of different strategies to promote integration over a wider range of services and settings are needed. these studies should include economic evaluation and the views of clients as clients' views will influence the uptake of integration strategies at the point of delivery and the effectiveness on community health of these strategies.

","intensive interventions, unsuited to primary care or population prevention programmes, provide only minimal reductions in blood pressure during long-term trials. further evaluations to assess effects on morbidity and mortality outcomes are needed for populations as a whole and for patients with elevated blood pressure. a low sodium diet may help in maintenance of lower blood pressure following withdrawal of antihypertensives. if this is confirmed, with no increase in cardiovascular events, then targeting of comprehensive dietary and behavioural programmes in patients with elevated blood pressure requiring drug treatment would be justified.

","calcium antagonists reduce the risk of poor outcome and secondary ischaemia after aneurysmal sah. the results for 'poor outcome' depend largely on a single large trial of oral nimodipine; the evidence for other calcium antagonists is inconclusive. the evidence for nimodipine is not beyond all doubt, but given the potential benefits and modest risks of this treatment, oral nimodipine is currently indicated in patients with aneurysmal sah. intravenous administration of calcium antagonists cannot be recommended for routine practice on the basis of the present evidence. magnesium sulphate is a promising agent but more evidence is needed before definite conclusions can be drawn.

","early intervention programmes for preterm infants have a positive influence on cognitive and motor outcomes during infancy, with the cognitive benefits persisting into pre-school age. there is a great deal of heterogeneity between studies due to the variety of early developmental intervention programmes trialled and gestational ages of the preterm infants included, which limits the comparisons of intervention programmes. further research is needed to determine which early developmental interventions are the most effective at improving cognitive and motor outcomes, and on the longer-term effects of these programmes.

","reserpine is effective in reducing sbp roughly to the same degree as other first-line antihypertensive drugs. however, we could not make definite conclusions regarding the dose-response pattern because of the small number of included trials. more rcts are needed to assess the effects of reserpine on blood pressure and to determine the dose-related safety profile before the role of this drug in the treatment of primary hypertension can be established.

","cytisine increases the chances of quitting, although absolute quit rates were modest in two recent trials. varenicline at standard dose increased the chances of successful long-term smoking cessation between two- and threefold compared with pharmacologically unassisted quit attempts. lower dose regimens also conferred benefits for cessation, while reducing the incidence of adverse events. more participants quit successfully with varenicline than with bupropion. two open-label trials of varenicline versus nrt suggested a modest benefit of varenicline but confidence intervals did not rule out equivalence. limited evidence suggests that varenicline may have a role to play in relapse prevention. the main adverse effect of varenicline is nausea, but mostly at mild to moderate levels and tending to subside over time. possible links with serious adverse events, including serious psychiatric or cardiovascular events, cannot be ruled out. future trials of cytisine may test extended regimens and more intensive behavioural support. there is a need for further trials of the efficacy of varenicline treatment extended beyond 12 weeks.

","stepwise and partial excavation reduced the incidence of pulp exposure in symptomless, vital, carious primary as well as permanent teeth. therefore these techniques show clinical advantage over complete caries removal in the management of dentinal caries. there was no evidence of a difference in signs or symptoms of pulpal disease between stepwise excavation, and complete caries removal, and insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there was a difference in signs and symptoms of pulp disease between partial caries removal and complete caries removal. when partial caries removal was carried out there was also insufficient evidence to determine whether or not there is a difference in risk of restoration failure. the no dentinal caries removal studies investigating permanent teeth had a similar result with no difference in restoration failure. the other no dentinal caries removal study, which investigated primary teeth, showed a statistically significant difference in restoration failure favouring the intervention. due to the short term follow-up in most of the included studies and the high risk of bias, further high quality, long term clinical trials are still required to assess the most effective intervention. however, it should be noted that in studies of this nature, complete elimination of risk of bias may not necessarily be possible. future research should also investigate patient centred outcomes.

","we cannot make any definite statements on the efficacy and clinical usefulness of electrotherapy modalities for neck pain. since the quality of evidence is low or very low, we are uncertain about the estimate of the effect. further research is very likely to change both the estimate of effect and our confidence in the results. current evidence for pemf, rms, and tens shows that these modalities might be more effective than placebo but not other interventions. funding bias should be considered, especially in pemf studies. galvanic current, iontophoresis, electric muscle stimulation(ems), and static magnetic field did not reduce pain or disability. future trials on these interventions should have larger patient samples and include more precise standardization and description of all treatment characteristics.

","there is an absence of evidence as to whether clioquinol (pbt1) has any positive clinical benefit for patients with ad, or whether the drug is safe. we have some concerns about the quality of the study methodology; there was an imbalance in treatment and control groups after randomisation (participants in the active treatment group had a higher mean pre-morbid iq) and the secondary analyses of results stratified by baseline dementia severity. the planned phase iii trial of pbt1 has been abandoned and this compound has been withdrawn from development. the second trial of pbt2 was more rigorously conducted and showed that after 12 weeks this compound appeared to be safe and well tolerated in people with mild alzheimer's dementia. larger trials are now required to demonstrate cognitive efficacy.

","providing additional placental blood to the preterm baby by either delaying cord clamping for 30 to 120 seconds, rather than early clamping, seems to be associated with less need for transfusion, better circulatory stability, less intraventricular haemorrhage (all grades) and lower risk for necrotising enterocolitis. however, there were insufficient data for reliable conclusions about the comparative effects on any of the primary outcomes for this review.

","despite reviewing 39 eligible trials, few firm conclusions could be reached because of the multiple comparisons considered, the small size of individual trials, and their low quality. whether or not to use a particular policy is usually a trade-off between the risks of morbidity (especially infection) and risks of recatheterisation.

","oseltamivir and zanamivir appear to have modest benefit in reducing duration of illness in children with influenza. however, our analysis was limited by small sample sizes and an inability to pool data from different studies. in addition, the inclusion of data from published trials only may have resulted in significant publication bias. based on published trial data, oseltamivir reduces the incidence of acute otitis media in children aged one to five years but is associated with a significantly increased risk of vomiting. one study demonstrated that laninamivir octanoate was more effective than oseltamivir in shortening duration of illness in children with oseltamivir-resistant influenza a/h1n1. the benefit of oseltamivir and zanamivir in preventing the transmission of influenza in households is modest and based on weak evidence. however, the clinical efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in 'at risk' children is still uncertain. larger high-quality trials are needed with sufficient power to determine the efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors in preventing serious complications of influenza (such as pneumonia or hospital admission), particularly in 'at risk' groups.

","the results of this review suggest that phakic iols are safer than excimer laser surgical correction for moderate to high myopia in the range of -6.0 to -20.0 d and phakic iols are preferred by patients. while phakic iols might be accepted clinical practice for higher levels of myopia (greater than or equal to 7.0 d of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism), it may be worth considering phakic iol treatment over excimer laser correction for more moderate levels of myopia (less than or equal to 7.0 d of myopic spherical equivalent with or without astigmatism). further rcts adequately powered for subgroup analysis are necessary to further elucidate the ideal range of myopia for phakic iols.

","there was no clear evidence of any effect of corticosteroids on substantive clinical outcomes. those receiving steroids showed significantly greater improvement in platelet counts which was greater for those receiving dexamethasone than those receiving betamethasone. there is to date insufficient evidence of benefits in terms of substantive clinical outcomes to support the routine use of steroids for the management of hellp. the use of corticosteroids may be justified in clinical situations in which increased rate of recovery in platelet count is considered clinically worthwhile.

","compulsory community treatment results in no significant difference in service use, social functioning or quality of life compared with standard care. people receiving compulsory community treatment were, however, less likely to be victims of violent or non-violent crime. it is unclear whether this benefit is due to the intensity of treatment or its compulsory nature. evaluation of a wide range of outcomes should be considered when this type of legislation is introduced.

","the available evidence indicates some beneficial effects with second-generation antipsychotics, mood stabilisers, and dietary supplementation by omega-3 fatty acids. however, these are mostly based on single study effect estimates. antidepressants are not widely supported for bpd treatment, but may be helpful in the presence of comorbid conditions. total bpd severity was not significantly influenced by any drug. no promising results are available for the core bpd symptoms of chronic feelings of emptiness, identity disturbance and abandonment. conclusions have to be drawn carefully in the light of several limitations of the rct evidence that constrain applicability to everyday clinical settings (among others, patients' characteristics and duration of interventions and observation periods).

","the pregnancy rate was found to be higher when gnrha was used in a long protocol as compared to a short or ultrashort protocol. there was no evidence of a difference in live birth rate, but this outcome was only reported by three studies. there was no evidence of a difference in the outcomes amongst various long protocols; nor that stopping or reducing gnrha at the start of stimulation was associated with a reduced pregnancy rate. for all comparison, except a long versus short protocol, there was a lack of power.

","methylphenidate, clonidine, guanfacine, desipramine and atomoxetine appear to reduce adhd symptoms in children with tics. although stimulants have not been shown to worsen tics in most people with tic disorders, they may nonetheless exacerbate tics in individual cases. in these instances, treatment with alpha agonists or atomoxetine may be an alternative. although there is evidence that desipramine is effective for both tics and adhd in children, safety concerns will likely continue to limit its use in this population.

","benefits of screening include a modest reduction in colorectal cancer mortality, a possible reduction in cancer incidence through the detection and removal of colorectal adenomas, and potentially, the less invasive surgery that earlier treatment of colorectal cancers may involve.harmful effects of screening include the psycho-social consequences of receiving a false-positive result, the potentially significant complications of colonoscopy or a false-negative result, the possibility of overdiagnosis (leading to unnecessary investigations or treatment) and the complications associated with treatment.

","our review update included data from four new randomised studies of the ketogenic diet. although none were blinded, some were of good quality. these studies suggest that in children, the ketogenic diet results in short to medium term benefits in seizure control, the effects of which are comparable to modern antiepileptic drugs. however, one study of long term outcome reports a high attrition rate for the diet. this would suggest that many children find the diet difficult to tolerate. the main reasons for drop-outs in the included studies included gastrointestinal side effects and dislike for the diet. we found just three studies on the use of the diet in adults and none of these were randomised. there has been less research involving other diets. we found one randomised study of reasonable quality of the atkins diet. this study showed similar benefits in seizure control with a less restrictive diet. for those with medically intractable epilepsy or those in whom surgery is unsuitable, a ketogenic diet could improve seizure control, but tolerability is poor. one observational study suggested that the atkins diet may have a similar effect on seizure control, but this requires more investigation.

","mass mailing a printed bulletin which summarises systematic review evidence may improve evidence-based practice when there is a single clear message, if the change is relatively simple to accomplish, and there is a growing awareness by users of the evidence that a change in practice is required. if the intention is to develop awareness and knowledge of systematic review evidence, and the skills for implementing this evidence, a multifaceted intervention that addresses each of these aims may be required, though there is insufficient evidence to support this approach.

","this update of the review published in 2004 incorporates additional trials and more mature data. it demonstrates the benefit of concurrent chemoradiation over radiotherapy alone or sequential chemoradiotherapy. patient selection is an important consideration in view of the added toxicity of concurrent treatment. uncertainty remains as to how far this is purely due to a radiosensitising effect and whether similar benefits could be achieved by using modern radiotherapy techniques and more dose intensive accelerated and/ or hyperfractionated radiotherapy regimens.

","parenteral high dose methotrexate and sulfasalazine are the only two agents with well demonstrated published efficacy in psoriatic arthritis. the magnitude of the effect seen with azathioprine, etretinate, oral low dose methotrexate and perhaps colchicine suggests that they may be effective but that further multicentre clinical trials are required to establish their efficacy. furthermore, the magnitude of the improvement observed in the placebo group strongly suggests that uncontrolled trials should not be used to guide management decisions in this condition.

","the quantity and especially quality of data are low. analysis shows a reduction in overall complications, but major complications were not reduced. length of stay was reduced significantly. we state that eras seems safe, but the quality of trials and lack of sufficient other outcome parameters do not justify implementation of eras as the standard of care. within eras protocols included, no answer regarding the role for minimally invasive surgery (i.e. laparoscopy) was found. furthermore, protocol compliance within eras programs has not been investigated, while this seems a known problem in the field. therefore, more specific and large rct's are needed.

","the included studies provide strong evidence for increased ferritin and transferrin saturation levels, together with a small increase in haemoglobin, in patients with ckd who were treated with iv iron compared with oral iron. from a limited body of evidence, we identified a significant reduction in esa requirements in patients treated with iv iron, and found no significant difference in mortality. adverse effects were reported in only 50% of included studies. we therefore suggest that further studies that focus on patient-centred outcomes are needed to determine if the use of iv iron is justified on the basis of reductions in esa dose and cost, improvements in patient quality of life, and with few serious adverse effects.

","t-tube drainage appeared to result in significantly longer operating time and hospital stay compared with primary closure without any apparent evidence of benefit on clinically important outcomes after open common bile duct exploration. based on the currently available evidence, there is no justification for the routine use of t-tube drainage after open common bile duct exploration in patients with common bile duct stones. t-tube drainage should not be used outside well designed randomised clinical trials. more randomised trials comparing the effects of t-tube drainage versus primary closure after open common bile duct exploration may be needed. such trials should be conducted with low risk of bias and assessing the long-term beneficial and harmful effects of t-tube drainage, including long-term complications such as bile stricture and recurrence of common bile duct stones.

","the range of proven effective interventions for chronic pelvic pain remains limited and recommendations are based largely on single studies. given the prevalence and healthcare costs associated with chronic pelvic pain in women, randomised controlled trials of other medical, surgical and psychological interventions are urgently required.chronic pelvic pain is common in women in the reproductive and older age groups and it causes disability and distress that result in significant costs to health services. the pathogenesis of chronic pelvic pain is poorly understood. often investigation by laparoscopy reveals no obvious cause for the pain. there are several possible explanations for chronic pelvic pain including undetected irritable bowel syndrome, and central sensitisation of the nervous system. a vascular hypothesis proposes that pain arises from dilated pelvic veins in which blood flow is markedly reduced. as the pathophysiology of chronic pelvic pain is not well understood, its treatment is often unsatisfactory and limited to symptom relief. currently the main approaches to treatment include counselling or psychotherapy, attempts to provide reassurance using laparoscopy to exclude serious pathology, progestogen therapy such as with medroxyprogesterone acetate and surgery to interrupt nerve pathways.

","while cocs containing 20 μg ee may be theoretically safer, this review did not focus on the rare events required to assess this hypothesis. data from existing randomized controlled trials are inadequate to detect possible differences in contraceptive effectiveness. low-dose estrogen cocs resulted in higher rates of bleeding pattern disruptions. however, most trials compared cocs containing different progestin types, and changes in bleeding patterns could be related to progestin type as well as estrogen dose. higher follow-up rates are essential for meaningful interpretation of results.

","internal fixation is associated with less initial operative trauma but has an increased risk of re-operation on the hip. definite conclusions cannot be made for differences in pain and residual disability between the two groups. future studies should concentrate on better reporting of final outcome measures and function. there is still a need for studies to define which patient groups are better served by the different treatment methods.

","repetitive task training resulted in modest improvement in lower limb function, but not upper limb function. training may be sufficient to impact on daily living function. however, there is no evidence that improvements are sustained once training has ended. the review potentially investigates task specificity rather more than repetition. further research should focus on the type and amount of training, and how to maintain functional gain.

","methotrexate may have a small steroid sparing effect in adults with asthma who are dependent on oral corticosteroids. however, the overall reduction in daily steroid use is probably not large enough to reduce steroid-induced adverse effects. this small potential to reduce the impact of steroid side-effects is probably insufficient to offset the adverse effects of methotrexate.

","both small trials had significant risks of bias and do not provide reliable evidence on the effects of surgery for cervical spondylotic radiculopathy or myelopathy. it is unclear whether the short-term risks of surgery are offset by long-term benefits. further research is very likely to have an impact on the estimate of effect and our confidence in it. there is low quality evidence that surgery may provide pain relief faster than physiotherapy or hard collar immobilization in patients with cervical radiculopathy; but there is little or no difference in the long-term. there is very low quality evidence that patients with mild myelopathy feel subjectively better shortly after surgery, but there is little or no difference in the long-term.

","we do not know whether pq added to treatment regimens for patients with p. falciparum infection reduces transmission of malaria. in individual patients, it reduces gametocyte prevalence and density. in practical terms, even if pq results in large reductions in gametocytes in people being treated for malaria, there is no reliable evidence that this will reduce transmission in a malaria-endemic community, where many people are infected but have no symptoms and are unlikely to be treated. since pq is acting as a monotherapy against gametocytes, there is a risk of the parasite developing resistance to the drug. in terms of harms, there is insufficient evidence from trials to know whether the drug can be used safely in this way in populations where g6pd deficiency occurs. in light of these doubts about safety, and lack of evidence of any benefit in reducing transmission, countries should question whether to continue to use pq routinely in primary treatment of malaria. further synthesis of observational data on safety and new trials may help elucidate a role for pq in malaria elimination, or in situations where most infected individuals are symptomatic and receive treatment.

","caution is required in interpreting the results given the methodological limitations of the included trials in terms of internal and external validity. further, the size and clinical meaningfulness of statistically significant results are uncertain. however, given the risks of untreated depression in terms of completed suicide and impacts on functioning, if a decision to use medication is agreed, then fluoxetine might be the medication of first choice given guideline recommendations. clinicians need to keep in mind that there is evidence of an increased risk of suicide-related outcomes in those treated with antidepressant medications.

","the results of this systematic review indicate that virtual reality endoscopy training can be used to effectively supplement early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) in diagnostic oesophagogastroduodenoscopy, colonoscopy and/or sigmoidoscopy for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. however, there remains insufficient evidence to advise for or against the use of virtual reality simulation-based training as a replacement for early conventional endoscopy training (apprenticeship model) for health professions trainees with limited or no prior endoscopic experience. there is a great need for the development of a reliable and valid measure of endoscopic performance prior to the completion of further randomised clinical trials with high methodological quality.

","although antibiotic treatment is effective for children with uti, there are insufficient data to answer the question of which type of antibiotic or which duration is most effective to treat symptomatic lower uti. this review found that 10-day antibiotic treatment is more likely to eliminate bacteria from the urine than single-dose treatments. no differences were observed for persistent bacteriuria, recurrence or re-infection between short and long-course antibiotics where the antibiotic differed between groups. this data adds to an existing cochrane review comparing short and long-course treatment of the same antibiotic who also reported no evidence of difference between short and long-course antibiotics.

","despite concerns surrounding the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic lbp, there remain few high-quality trials assessing their efficacy. the trials in this review, although achieving high internal validity scores, were characterized by a lack of generalizability, inadequate description of study populations, poor intention-to treat analyses, and limited interpretation of functional improvement. based on our results, the benefits of opioids in clinical practice for the long-term management of chronic lbp remain questionable. therefore, further high-quality studies that more closely simulate clinical practice are needed to assess the usefulness, and potential risks, of opioids for individuals with chronic lbp.

","gtr has a greater effect on probing measures of periodontal treatment than open flap debridement, including improved attachment gain, reduced pocket depth, less increase in gingival recession and more gain in hard tissue probing at re-entry surgery. however there is marked variability between studies and the clinical relevance of these changes is unknown. as a result, it is difficult to draw general conclusions about the clinical benefit of gtr. whilst there is evidence that gtr can demonstrate a significant improvement over conventional open flap surgery, the factors affecting outcomes are unclear from the literature and these might include study conduct issues such as bias. therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use. since trial reports were often incomplete, we recommend that future trials should follow the consort statement both in their conduct and reporting. there is therefore little value in future research repeating simple, small efficacy studies. the priority should be to identify factors associated with improved outcomes as well as investigating outcomes relevant to patients. types of research might include large observational studies to generate hypotheses for testing in clinical trials, qualitative studies on patient-centred outcomes and trials exploring innovative analytic methods such as multilevel modelling. open flap surgery should remain the control comparison in these studies.

","the use of ergometrine-oxytocin as part of the routine active management of the third stage of labour appears to be associated with a small but statistically significant reduction in the risk of pph when compared to oxytocin for blood loss of 500 ml or more. no statistically significant difference was observed between the groups for blood loss of 1000 ml or more. a statistically significant difference was observed in the presence of maternal side-effects, including elevation of diastolic blood pressure, vomiting and nausea, associated with ergometrine-oxytocin use compared to oxytocin use. thus, the advantage of a reduction in the risk of pph, between 500 and 1000 ml blood loss, needs to be weighed against the adverse side-effects associated with the use of ergometrine-oxytocin.

","a significant health disparity exists, whereby indigenous populations, a minority, are over-represented in the burden of smoking-related morbidity and mortality. this review highlights the paucity of evidence available to evaluate the effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, despite the known success of these interventions in non-indigenous populations. due to this lack of published investigations, the external validity of this review is limited, as is the ability to draw reliable conclusions from the results. the limited but available evidence reported does indicate that smoking cessation interventions specifically targeted at indigenous populations can produce smoking abstinence. however this evidence base is not strong with a small number of methodologically sound trials investigating these interventions. more rigorous trials are now required to assist in bridging the gap between tobacco related health disparities in indigenous and non-indigenous populations.

","there was a small reduction in the length of the third stage of labour and also in the amount of blood loss when cord drainage was applied compared with no cord drainage. the clinical importance of such observed statistically significant reductions, is open to debate. there is no clear difference in the need for manual removal of placenta, blood transfusion or the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. due to small trials with medium risk of bias, the results should be interpreted with caution.

","long-acting beta-2 agonists, particularly salmeterol, are more effective than theophylline in improving morning and evening pef, but are not significantly different in their effect on fev1. there is evidence of decreased daytime and nighttime short-acting beta-2 agonist requirement with salmeterol. fewer adverse events occurred in participants using long-acting beta-2 agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) as compared to theophylline.

","if we assume that screening reduces breast cancer mortality by 15% and that overdiagnosis and overtreatment is at 30%, it means that for every 2000 women invited for screening throughout 10 years, one will avoid dying of breast cancer and 10 healthy women, who would not have been diagnosed if there had not been screening, will be treated unnecessarily. furthermore, more than 200 women will experience important psychological distress including anxiety and uncertainty for years because of false positive findings. to help ensure that the women are fully informed before they decide whether or not to attend screening, we have written an evidence-based leaflet for lay people that is available in several languages on www.cochrane.dk. because of substantial advances in treatment and greater breast cancer awareness since the trials were carried out, it is likely that the absolute effect of screening today is smaller than in the trials. recent observational studies show more overdiagnosis than in the trials and very little or no reduction in the incidence of advanced cancers with screening.

","the finding that healing rates can be higher for cases treated surgically as compared to those treated non-surgically, at least in the short term, is based on two rcts only. a single rct reported that in the medium to long term healing rates for the two procedures are very similar. there is currently scarce evidence for a sound decision making process among alternative treatments for the re-treatment of a periradicular pathosis. more well-designed rcts should be performed with follow up of at least 4 years, and with a consistent sample size, to detect a true difference in the long term between the outcomes of the two alternative treatments, if any exist.

","in elective liver resection, hepatic vascular occlusion cannot be recommended over portal triad clamping. intermittent portal triad clamping seems to be better than continuous portal triad clamping at least in patients with chronic liver disease. there is no evidence to support selective inflow occlusion over portal triad clamping. the optimal method of intermittent portal triad clamping is not clear. there is no evidence for any difference between the ischaemic preconditioning followed by vascular occlusion and intermittent vascular occlusion for liver resection in patients with non-cirrhotic livers. further randomised trials of low risk of bias are needed to determine the optimal technique of vascular occlusion.

","the most likely effective treatment to slow myopia progression thus far is anti-muscarinic topical medication. however, side effects of these medications include light sensitivity and near blur. also, they are not yet commercially available, so their use is limited and not practical. further information is required for other methods of myopia control, such as the use of corneal reshaping contact lenses or bifocal soft contact lenses (bscls) with a distance center are promising, but currently no published randomized clinical trials exist.

","despite identifying 34 trials related to treatments for blepharitis, there is no strong evidence for any of the treatments in terms of curing chronic blepharitis. commercial products are marketed to consumers and prescribed to patients without substantial evidence of effectiveness. further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of such treatments. any rct designed for this purpose should separate participants by type of condition (e.g. staphylococcal blepharitis or mgd) in order to minimize imbalances between groups (type i errors) and to achieve statistical power for analyses (prevent type ii errors). medical interventions and commercial products should be compared with conventional lid hygiene measures, such as warm compresses and eyelid margin washing, to determine effectiveness, as well as head-to-head to show comparative effectiveness between treatments. outcomes of interest should be patient-centered and measured using validated questionnaires or scales. it is important that participants be followed long-term, at least one year, to assess chronic outcomes properly.

","terbutaline pump maintenance therapy has not been shown to decrease the risk of preterm birth by prolonging pregnancy. furthermore, the lack of information on the safety of the therapy, as well as its substantial expense, argues against its role in the management of arrested preterm labor. future use should only be in the context of well-conducted, adequately powered randomized controlled trials.

","there was insufficient robust evidence from randomised trials to establish the relative effectiveness of different methods of anaesthesia, different associated physical techniques or the use of drug adjuncts in the treatment of distal radial fractures. there is, however, some indication that haematoma block provides poorer analgesia than ivra, and can compromise reduction. given the many unresolved questions over the management of these fractures, we suggest an integrated programme of research, which includes consideration of anaesthesia options, is the way forward.

","in patients with good-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, intraoperative mild hypothermia might prevent death or dependency in activities of daily living for a few of them. however, the confidence intervals include the possibility of both benefit and harm. there is no evidence that intraoperative mild hypothermia is harmful. this treatment should not be routinely applied. in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage or without subarachnoid haemorrhage, there are insufficient data to draw any conclusions. a high-quality randomised clinical trial of intraoperative mild hypothermia for postoperative neurological deficits in patients with poor-grade aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage might be feasible.

","a large number of studies appear to address the research questions, but few are of sufficient quality to be reliable. available evidence does suggest these substances are better than placebo at alleviating depression. further studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 5-htp and tryptophan before their widespread use can be recommended. the possible association between these substances and the potentially fatal eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has not been elucidated. because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe the clinical usefulness of 5-htp and tryptophan is limited at present.

","the low to very low quality of the evidence of studies included in this review provides insufficient evidence to determine with certainty which interventions are most effective in changing professional behaviour and in what contexts. however, interventions that may be worth further study are educational interventions involving more than one active element and that are repeatedly administered over time, and interventions employing specialised personnel, who are focused on an aspect of care that is supported by evidence e.g. dentists/dental auxiliaries performing oral care for vap prevention.

","calcium supplementation is associated with a significant protective benefit in the prevention of pre-eclampsia, and should be used for this indication according to a previous review. this review indicates that there are no additional benefits for calcium supplementation in prevention of preterm birth or low infant birth weight. while there was a statistically significant difference of 80 g identified in mean infant birth weight, there was significant heterogeneity identified, and the clinical significance of this difference is uncertain.

","dietitians were better than doctors at lowering blood cholesterol in the short to medium term, but there was no evidence that they were better than self-help resources. there was no evidence that dietitians provided better outcomes than nurses.the results should be interpreted with caution as the studies were not of good quality and the analysis was based on a limited number of trials.

","the review suggests a substantial caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride varnish in both the permanent and the deciduous dentitions based largely on trials with no treatment controls. there is little information concerning acceptability of treatment or possible side effects in the included trials. given the relatively poor quality of most of the included studies and the wide confidence intervals around the estimates of effect, there remains a need for further trials. it is important that these trials should be of high quality and include assessment of potential adverse effects.

","stapled hemorrhoidopexy is associated with a higher long-term risk of hemorrhoid recurrence and the symptom of prolapse. it is also associated with a higher likelihood of long-term symptom recurrence and the need for additional operations compared to conventional excisional hemorrhoid surgeries. patients should be informed of these risks when being offered the stapled hemorrhoidopexy as surgical therapy. if hemorrhoid recurrence and prolapse are the most important clinical outcomes, then conventional excisional surgery remains the ""gold standard"" in the surgical treatment of internal hemorrhoids.

","although there are shortcomings and gaps in the data, there appears to be enough overall consistency for different outcomes. the efficacy and adverse effects profile of penfluridol are similar to other typical antipsychotics; both oral and depot. furthermore, penfluridol is shown to be an adequate treatment option for people with schizophrenia, especially those who do not respond to oral medication on a daily basis and do not adapt well to depot drugs. one of the results favouring penfluridol was a lower drop out rate in medium term when compared to depot medications. it is also an option for chronic sufferers of schizophrenia with residual psychotic symptoms who nevertheless need continuous use of antipsychotic medication. an additional benefit of penfluridol is that it is a low-cost intervention. note: the eight citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.

","on the basis of one randomised trial which did not describe its methodology in sufficient detail to assess risk of bias and quality, excluded 27% of patients after randomisation due to various reasons, and is probably not free from selective outcome reporting bias, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that in patients with colonic cancer liver metastases, electro-coagulation alone brings any significant benefit in terms of survival or recurrence compared with the control. in addition, there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of adding allopurinol or dimethyl sulphoxide to electro-coagulation. the probability for selective outcome reporting bias in the trial is high. more randomised trials are needed in order to sufficiently validate electro-coagulation with or without co-interventions.

","ivig administration results in a 3% reduction in sepsis and a 4% reduction in one or more episodes of any serious infection but is not associated with reductions in other clinically important outcomes, including mortality. prophylactic use of ivig is not associated with any short-term serious side effects. the decision to use prophylactic ivig will depend on the costs and the values assigned to the clinical outcomes. there is no justification for conducting additional rcts to test the efficacy of previously studied ivig preparations in reducing nosocomial infections in preterm and/or lbw infants.

","behavioral interventions reduce self-reported unprotected anal sex among msm. these results indicate that hiv prevention for this population can work and should be supported. results of previous studies provide a benchmark for expectations in new studies. meta-analysis can inform future design and implementation in terms of sample size, target populations, settings, goals for process measures, and intervention content. when effects differ by design variables, which are deliberately selected and planned, awareness of these characteristics may be beneficial to future designs. researchers designing future small group and individual-level studies should keep in mind that to date, effects of the greatest magnitude have been observed in studies that used count outcomes and a shorter intervention span (up to 1 month). among small group and individual-level studies, effects were also greatest when the comparison condition included minimal to no hiv prevention content. nevertheless, statistically significant favorable effects were also seen when the comparison condition included standard or other hiv prevention content. researchers choosing the latter option for new studies should plan for larger sample sizes based on the smaller expected net intervention effect noted above. when effects differ by implementation variables, which become evident as the study is conducted but are not usually selected or planned, caution may be advised so that future studies can reduce bias. because intervention effects were somewhat stronger (though not statistically significantly so) in studies with a greater attrition in the comparison condition, differential retention may be a threat to validity. extra effort should be given to retaining participants in comparison conditions. among community-level interventions, intervention effects were strongest among studies with random assignment of groups or communities. therefore the inclusion of studies where assignment of groups or communities was by convenience did not exaggerate the summary effect. the greater effectiveness of interventions including more than 25% non-gay identifying msm suggests that when they can be reached, these men may be more responsive than gay-identified men to risk reduction efforts. non-gay identified msm may have had less exposure to previous prevention messages, so their initial exposure may have a greater impact. the greater effectiveness of interventions that include efforts to promote personal skills such as keeping condoms available and behavioral self-management indicates that such content merits strong consideration in development and delivery of new interventions for msm. and the finding that interventions were most effective for majority white populations underscores the critical need for effective interventions for msm of african and latino descent. further research measuring the incidence of hiv and other stds is needed. because most studies were conducted among mostly white men in the us and europe, more evaluations of interventions are needed for african american and hispanic msm as well as msm in the developing world. more research is also needed to further clarify which behavioral strategies (e.g., reducing unprotected anal sex, having oral sex instead of anal sex, reducing number of partners, avoiding serodiscordant partners, strategic positioning, or reducing anal sex even with condom use) are most effective in reducing transmission among msm, the messages most effective in promoting these behaviors, and the methods and settings in which these messages can be most effectively delivered.

","the optimum treatment for lgs remains uncertain and no study to date has shown any one drug to be highly efficacious; rufinamide, lamotrigine, topiramate and felbamate may be helpful as add-on therapy, clobazam may be helpful for drop seizures. until further research has been undertaken, clinicians will need to continue to consider each patient individually, taking into account the potential benefit of each therapy weighed against the risk of adverse effects.

","there appears to be little basis for offering cse over epidurals in labour, with no difference in overall maternal satisfaction despite a slightly faster onset with cse and conversely less pruritus with low-dose epidurals. there was no difference in ability to mobilise, maternal hypotension, rate of caesarean birth or neonatal outcome. however, the significantly higher incidence of urinary retention, rescue interventions and instrumental deliveries with traditional techniques would favour the use of low-dose epidurals. it is not possible to draw any meaningful conclusions regarding rare complications such as nerve injury and meningitis.

","implications for practice oral borage oil and evening primrose oil lack effect on eczema; improvement was similar to respective placebos used in trials. oral bo and epo are not effective treatments for eczema. in these studies, along with the placebos, epo and bo have the same, fairly common, mild, transient adverse effects, which are mainly gastrointestinal. the short-term studies included here do not examine possible adverse effects of long-term use of epo or bo. a case report warned that if epo is taken for a prolonged period of time (more than one year), there is a potential risk of inflammation, thrombosis, and immunosuppression; another study found that epo may increase bleeding for people on coumadin® (warfarin) medication. implications for research noting that the confidence intervals between active and placebo treatment are narrow, to exclude the possibility of any clinically useful difference, we concluded that further studies on epo or bo for eczema would be hard to justify. this review does not provide information about long-term use of these products.

","this review provides no clear evidence for the treatment of cirrhotic patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. in practice, third generation cephalosporins have already been established as the standard treatment of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, and it is clear, that empirical antibiotic therapy should be provided in any case. however, until large, well-conducted trials provide more information, practice will remain based on impression, not evidence.

","the value of the various approaches to conservative management of postprostatectomy incontinence after radical prostatectomy remains uncertain. it seems unlikely that men benefit from one-to-one pelvic floor muscle training therapy after transurethral resection of the prostate (turp). long-term incontinence may be managed by external penile clamp, but there are safety problems.

","bupropion increases smoking abstinence rates in smokers with schizophrenia, without jeopardizing their mental state. varenicline may also improve smoking cessation rates in schizophrenia, but its possible psychiatric adverse effects cannot be ruled out. cr may help this group of patients to quit and reduce smoking in the short term. we failed to find convincing evidence that other interventions have a beneficial effect on smoking in schizophrenia.
