","epidural analgesia provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. it reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half. the occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, gastric complications and renal complications was reduced by epidural analgesia. however, current evidence does not confirm the beneficial effect of epidural analgesia on postoperative mortality and other types of complications.

","in some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. the nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.

","antibiotics for copd exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an icu. however, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. the risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. these inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

","no definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. the evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. we conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. however, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.

however, the rate of energy consumption was much higher in the traumatic group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the main differences in the range of motion of the joints were in the frontal plane: the eversion-inversion movement of the ankle and the adduction-abduction movement of the hip. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT significant differences were found in energy consumption between the traumatic and vascular groups, and significant changes in walking under different speeds and different inclines. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT during the level treadmill test, the traumatic amputee subjects showed a decrease of energy expenditure with the new prosthetic foot, more significant at sufficient speed (4 km/h): 17.00 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the sach foot consistently produced the greatest ground reaction forces on the sound limb; however, this was not statistically significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with the c-walk and sach, the flex-foot showed no significant differences in energy expenditure and gait efficiency, but significantly lower percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate and rpe values. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the dynamic flex foot allowed subjects to rely more heavily on the prosthetic foot for propulsion and stability during walking with minimal compensations at the remaining joints. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT because no energy savings resulted for the der feet, the release of stored energy in the flexible feet may not occur at the proper time to assist in ambulation as a result of the natural frequency of oscillation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT increased efficiency of pushoff in the seattle ankle/lite foot exists as evidenced by the decrease loading on the opposite limb during double support and a less shortened step length on the sound side compared to the sach foot. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in early stance, peak foot and shank velocities were lower (p < 0.01) for both the sl and ff while only shank velocity was lower (p < 0.01) with the sa compared to na controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with conventional hydraulic knee controls, the oxygen consumption of transfemoral amputees provided with an electronically controlled hydraulic knee joint is reduced. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT traumatic unilateral transtibial amputees wearing two different prosthetic feet in the early rehabilitation stage |POPULATION nine right-limb traumatic amputees |POPULATION eight men who had unilateral traumatic below-knee amputation and on nine control subjects |POPULATION dysvascular below-knee amputees |POPULATION persons with dysvascular below-knee amputations |POPULATION persons with transtibial amputations with various prostheses |POPULATION five physically active men with unilateral transtibial amputations served as subjects (aged 31.6 |POPULATION people with transtibial amputations with 3 different prostheses |POPULATION ten male individuals with transtibial amputations |POPULATION below-knee amputee gait with dynamic elastic response prosthetic feet |POPULATION trans-tibial (tt) amputees |POPULATION 1341 gait trials at different cadences were analysed (383 with normal subjects and 958 with amputees |POPULATION using the four prosthetic feet under study |POPULATION seventeen male subjects with below-knee amputation (nine traumatic and seven dysvascular |POPULATION dysvascular and traumatic below-knee amputees |POPULATION knee disarticulation amputees |POPULATION nine amputees were included in the trial |POPULATION 16 male below-knee amputees |POPULATION eight vascular and eight traumatic |POPULATION while |POPULATION below-knee amputees wearing three different prosthetic feet |POPULATION 19.9 years) and 12 patients with vascular below-knee amputations (mean age: 73 |POPULATION traumatic below-knee vascular amputations |POPULATION twelve patients with traumatic below-knee amputations (mean age: 50.0 |POPULATION subjects on a walkway at a self-selected velocity;

","there is insufficient evidence from high quality comparative studies for the overall superiority of any individual type of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism, although there is a small trend towards the flex-foot in comparison with the sach foot for greater stride length and lower energy cost in individuals with a transtibial amputation, and improved gait efficiency and lower energy cost in high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation. in prescribing prosthetic-ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, the type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter-relationship with ankle-foot mechanisms, and cost.

","this review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. this treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective.

","according to the results, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. however, height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention. there is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. for instance, there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. however, though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation, haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year. the conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. the authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases.

","the findings of this review identified one its study for a non-medical procedure conducted in a dental outpatient setting. the study suggested that the use of a specific educational intervention, in the above-mentioned context, which targets junior dental staff using a training session that included cases of wrong-site surgery, presentation of clinical guidelines and feedback by the instructor, was associated with a reduction in the incidence of wrong-site tooth extractions. given the nature of the intervention in a very specific population, application of these results to a broader population undergoing other forms of surgery or invasive procedures should be undertaken cautiously.

","placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for copd patients as individual therapies. this review, which included trials allowing comparisons between laba and ics, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. on the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. this review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for copd, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

","recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. this review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses. well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.

","this review found that programmes to promote smoke alarms have at most modest beneficial effects on smoke alarm ownership and function, and no demonstrated beneficial effect on fires or fire-related injuries. counselling as part of child health surveillance has a somewhat greater effect on smoke alarm ownership and function, but its effects on injuries are unevaluated. community smoke alarm give-away programmes have not been demonstrated to increase smoke alarm prevalence or to reduce fires or fire-related injuries. community-based education programmes have not been shown to reduce burns or fire-related injuries. community smoke alarm installation programmes may increase the prevalence of working alarms and reduce fire-related injuries, but these results require confirmation, and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes has not been evaluated. efforts to promote smoke alarms through installation programmes should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

","surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. more and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.

","concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ics/laba over laba alone in preventing exacerbations. the effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. there was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ics/laba. there was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and fev1 improved more on ics/laba than on laba, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. to an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations. more information would be useful on the relative benefits and adverse event rates with combination inhalers using different doses of inhaled corticosteroids. evidence from head-to-head comparisons is needed to assess the comparative risks and benefits of the different combination inhalers.

","sulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active crohn's disease. olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. high dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. high dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. in conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active crohn's disease. however, the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.

","whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses to follow up. health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. for example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.

","extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used ayre spatula. the most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. the rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. the ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.

","there is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. the results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. the findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available: topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. in most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. however, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. in addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. the evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. further investigation is needed. given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. it may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. if they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

","people with amd may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. this finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished american population. the generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known. although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. a systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed.

recanalization of vertebral dissections was associated with a favorable prognosis [or 3.2 (95% ci 1.1-8.8; p = 0.02)]. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the spontaneous course of such a dissection most often (80%) leads to an almost complete resolution of clinical and angiographic signs. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the follow-up investigations moreover demonstrated that intracranial haemodynamics may change from day to day in patients suffering from internal carotid artery dissection. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT four anticoagulated patients developed seizures, compared to 2 patients with antiplatelets (p > 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT during follow-up, ischemic events were rare (ischemic stroke, 0.3%; tia, 3.4%; retinal ischemia, 1%); their frequency did not significantly differ between patients treated with anticoagulants (5.9%) and those treated with aspirin (2.1%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT examples of suspected dissection of the intracranial internal carotid, middle cerebral, posterior cerebral and extracranial vertebral arteries are also presented. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT after a mean follow-up of 31 months, four (0.9%) patients presented a recurrent ischemic stroke attributable to either not yet completely recovered initial cad (n = 2) or a recurrent cad (n = 2). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT bleeding complications from full anticoagulation were higher than with antiplatelet agents (p = 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT cerebral ischaemia was present in 90% of cases and occurred within a month of the initial event in all cases but one and was the first symptom in 53% of cases. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT among the patients studied, 82% were caucasian, 53% were male and the average age was 41.7 years old. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the internal carotid artery (ica) was the most frequently involved vessel (63%), followed by the vertebral artery (30%, and multivessel involvement in two patients (7%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT patients with cad presented more often with a partial horner's syndrome and had a higher prevalence of fibromuscular dysplasia than patients with vad. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no mortalities were noted. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the overall mortality was 12%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT frontal and parietal localizations were significantly associated with internal carotid artery dissection (p=0.013 and p=0.010, respectively), whereas occipital and nuchal pain, with vertebral artery dissection (p=0.047 and p<0.001, respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT spontaneous dissection of the internal carotid artery is not well known in scandinavia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT doppler ultrasound screening of young patients presenting with stroke, identified 10 patients with reduced common and internal carotid blood flow without any evidence of atheroma. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT doppler investigation was able to detect, with a rather satisfying reliability, anomalies in the carotid flow before angiography ; angiogram showed lesions nearly always facing first or second cervical vertebra and bilateral lesions in four instances. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT angiographic findings can verify this diagnosis, showing various signs of eccentric, narrowing stenosis, false lumen, pseudoaneurysms, or complete occlusion. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT dissections cause approximately three per cent of non-haemorrhagic stroke and are usually observed in young and middle-aged patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ischemic optic neuropathy occurred after a mean of 5.3 days (range, 3-8 days) following the first symptom, which was headache in 1 patient, transient monocular blindness in 2, and hemispheric transient ischemic attack in 1. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT most dissections were extracranial. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT early heparin sodium therapy may help prevent intraluminal clotting without carrying an important risk of extending the dissection, but its clinical benefit remains unproven. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT all recovered without deficits. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT seven (2.3%) patients died during the follow-up (mean 4.0 years, 1186 patient years). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were no deaths. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT five patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical

","there is good evidence that both ert and hrt do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. it is not known whether either specific types of ert or hrt have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory. there is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment. it remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. in addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. large rcts currently underway in the usa may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. in the meantime, based on the available evidence, ert or hrt cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment.

","well designed rcts, evaluating a high number of patients were included in the review. recombinant ifn beta does not prevent the development of permanent physical disability in spms. we were unable to verify the effect on cognitive function for the lack of comparable data. this treatment significantly reduces the risk of relapse and of short -term relapse-related disability. overall, these results show that ifns' anti-inflammatory effect is unable to retard progression, when established. in the future, no new rcts for ifns versus placebo in spms will probably be undertaken, because research is now focusing on innovative drugs. we believe that this review gives conclusive evidence on the clinical efficacy of ifns versus placebo in spms.

","haloperidol is a potent antipsychotic drug but has a high propensity to cause adverse effects. where there is no treatment option, use of haloperidol to counter the damaging and potentially dangerous consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified. however, where a choice of drug is available, people with schizophrenia and clinicians may wish to prescribe an alternative antipsychotic with less likelihood of adverse effects such as parkinsonism, akathisia and acute dystonias. haloperidol should not be a control drug of choice for randomised trials of new antipsychotics.

","the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin c reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out. nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin c on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them. further therapeutic rcts are warranted.

","the data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. for chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and ""alternative"" treatments. the data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.

","duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. no differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some ssris (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). this limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. as many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. as for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. in the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. given that several ssris and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

","the available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for lbp. based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. when combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. from the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. it should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with lbp. further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.

","there is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. the quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. one such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4-<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. weak evidence suggests that low doses (≧2-<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. high doses (≧10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. we advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.

","despite evidence from a small number of individual studies to suggest that emg-bfb plus standard physiotherapy produces improvements in motor power, functional recovery and gait quality when compared to standard physiotherapy alone, combination of all the identified studies did not find a treatment benefit. overall the results are limited because the trials were small, generally poorly designed and utilised varying outcome measures.

","the most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.

","this review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. for presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. there is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.

","the available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. in addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. one small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. there is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. the single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side effects.

","the results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.

","combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be a viable option for patients of good performance status with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, but further trials that report adequate survival and qol data are sought. response rates and improvements in survival are low. cisplatin-based combinations have significant toxicity. outcomes are poor and novel cytotoxic/biological agents and optimal scheduling need further investigation. future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence.

","the best evidence suggests that newer treatments including terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole may be similar to griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis caused by trichophyton species. newer treatments may be preferred because shorter treatment durations may improve treatment adherence, although they may be more expensive. there is not enough evidence on the use of systemic treatments in children with microsporum infections. not all treatments for tinea capitis are available in paediatric formulations but all have reasonable safety profiles.

","universal initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated on the available evidence. there is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications including stroke. the higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each person.

","available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. however, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. the results of the single rct of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. further, well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology.

","problems following abi vary. consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to suit the needs of patients with different problems. patients presenting acutely to hospital with moderate to severe brain injury should be routinely followed up to assess their needs for rehabilitation. intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains. the balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation should have access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs. those with milder brain injury benefit from follow up and appropriate information and advice. not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. some questions include which treatments work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. in future, such questions will need to be set alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic, longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.

","alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates.

considerably lower than the expected level at water fluoridation concentrations of 1 ppm. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in bivariate analyses, mild fluorosis was significantly related to ingestion of fluoride dentifrice at ages 24 and 36 months (p = .02 for both). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no statistically significant increased risk of dental fluorosis prevalence associated with any of the fluoride exposure risk factors examined, including reported usage of (1000 ppm) fluoride toothpaste from time of first deciduous tooth eruption. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in the deprived districts the prevalences of fluorosis were 25.2 and 19.5% (p = 0.2). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT multivariate analysis indicated that area of residence (odds ratio = 4.5), jarman score (odds ratio = 0.99 per jarman unit) and type of toothpaste (odds ratio = 1.6) were statistically significantly related to presence or absence of fluorosis: the risk factors were--fluoridated area, affluence, and use of adult toothpaste. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT higher fluoride exposure slightly increased the likelihood that a child had a higher tfi score, especially when more fluoridation technologies were used at home. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no significant difference in the prevalence of caries in either primary or permanent teeth although the trend in both cases was for slightly more disease in children who had used the test paste. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a very strong association was observed with inappropriate fluoride supplement use (or = 23.74, 95% ci 3.43-164.30). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was a strong association between mild-to-moderate fluorosis on later forming (fri classification ii) enamel surfaces and both supplement use (or = 7.97, 95% ci 2.98-21.33) and early toothbrushing habits (or = 4.23, 95% ci 1.72-10.41). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT from logistic regression, the prevalence of caries was significantly associated with age, dental attendance, and the use of a water supply fluoridated at 1.0 ppm. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was a strong association between mild-to-moderate fluorosis on later forming (fri classification ii) enamel surfaces and infant formula use in the form of powdered concentrate (or=10.77, 95% ci 1.89-61.25), fluoride supplement use (or=10.83, 95% ci 1.90-61.55), and early fluoride toothpaste use (or=8.37, 95% ci 1.68-41.72). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the multivariate model showed that the effect of the supplementary fluoride sources was different between children that started brushing with toothpaste before two years of age (or = 6.15; ic 95% = 2.03-18.67) and after (or = 2.14; ic 95% = 1.16-3.94). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mean dmft values in perth and bunbury were 0.32 and 0.28 (p > 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the child's birth weight and liking for or swallowing of toothpaste did not influence the prevalence of fluorosis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no association between behavior problems and dental fluorosis in this population. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the prevalence of fluorosis by tf1+ case definition declined from 34.7% to 22.1% and by tf2+ case definition from 17.9% to 8.3%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT swallowed fluoride toothpaste in the early years of life has been postulated to be a risk factor for fluorosis, but the epidemiological evidence is weakened by the fact that most of the relevant studies were done in developed countries where an individual is exposed to multiple sources of fluoride. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT weaning before 9 months of age, swallowing toothpaste and liking toothpaste were also statistically significant risk factors. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the risk of fluorosis was significantly greater for children who had greater exposure to fluoridated water and who used larger amounts of fluoridated toothpaste up to age eight. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT children with dental fluorosis were 1.75 times more likely to be free of caries (or = 1.75-ci:0.43, 6.68). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT those who brushed their teeth before the age of 25 months had 11 times the odds of fluorosis compared with those beginning toothbrushing later; prolonged use of infant formula (greater than or equal to 13 months) was associated with 3.5 times the risk of fluorosis, compared with no, or shorter duration of, formula use. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT an odds ratio of 1.7 associated with infant formula use was suggestive of an increased risk of enamel fluorosis as was an odds ratio of 2.9 associated with fluoride dentifrice use. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT logistic regression established tooth brushing frequency and fluoride supplement use, in addition to tap water fluoride concentrations above 0.7 mg/l, as significant risk factors when the presence of fluorosis on at least one tooth was used as outcome variable. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the prevalence of fluorosis among children in acorn group a-c was significantly greater

","there should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. there is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. the evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. if the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm). more evidence with low risk of bias is needed. future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. as it is unethical to propose rcts to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. however, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies.

","differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. in day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. there is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.

","the pooled analyses suggest that peg preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. grade analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow up. however, peg appears safe and well tolerated. there is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil), which was also well tolerated.there is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. further research is needed to investigate the long term use of peg for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin.

","this review shows that xpert used as an initial diagnostic test for tb detection and rifampicin resistance detection in patients suspected of having tb, mdr-tb, or hiv-associated tb is sensitive and specific. xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test following microscopy for patients who have previously been found to be smear-negative. an xpert result that is positive for rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of mdr-tb in a given patient and the expected prevalence of mdr-tb in a given setting. studies in this review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in reference laboratories in research investigations. most studies were performed in high tb burden countries. ongoing use of xpert in high tb burden countries will contribute to the evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care settings, including settings where the test is performed at the point of care.

","we could demonstrate a benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient's age and the type of internal shunt used. the benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. however this data derives from the rate of shunt infection, which is an intermediary outcome. future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo, and should include all-cause mortality, shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. evidence suggests that antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well-designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic-impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit.

","the evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. the simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. the various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. as women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.

","in keeping with previous world health organization (who) recommendations everything possible should be done to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients, while recognising that this may not be sufficient to correct specific micronutrient deficiencies in all hiv-infected individuals. specific recommendations for pregnant and lactating women infected with hiv would be to include the provision of multivitamin supplements in single rda formulations during the antenatal period and at least for 6 weeks post-partum, especially for women who are breast-feeding. there is no conclusive evidence to provide stand-alone zinc or selenium supplementation to hiv-infected pregnant and lactating women. micronutrient supplementation should not be used as a substitute for provision of recommended antiretroviral medication for preventing mother-to-child transmission of hiv and treating maternal hiv infection when this is recommended. further trials of single supplements are required to build the evidence base. the long-term clinical benefits, adverse effects, and optimal formulation of multiple micronutrient supplements require further investigation in pregnant women at different stages of hiv infection.

","one definition of active management includes directions to administer an uterotonic with birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby and to clamp the umbilical cord within 30-60 seconds of birth of the baby (which is not always feasible in practice). in this review delaying clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. in addition, late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor, although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.

","from the evidence available, the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture does not appear to have any benefit. however, the evidence is also insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, or to confirm additional complications due to traction use. given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre-operative traction, the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre-operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.
