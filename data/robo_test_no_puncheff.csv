","results indicate that pan may be an effective treatment of the mild to moderate alcoholic withdrawal state. the rapidity of the therapeutic effect of pan therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, accelerating the patients recovery. our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that pan is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. clinicians wishing to use pan may initially wish to do so within trial settings. further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the pan therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of pan by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed.

","available evidence, although not conclusive, suggests platinum-based chemotherapy is better than non-platinum therapy. there is some evidence that combination therapy improves survival compared with platinum alone. no difference in effect has been shown between cisplatin and carboplatin.

","there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in low or high doses for preterm infants with or at risk of feeding intolerance. future research is needed to determine if there is a more precise dose range where erythromycin might be effective as a prokinetic agent in preterm infants > 32 weeks' ga.

","although this review suggests that diazepam alone compared with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine may be more effective in treating tetanus, the small size, methodological limitations and lack of data on drug safety from available trials preclude definite conclusions to support change in current clinical practice. the application of this observation should be moderated by local needs and circumstances, pending the availability of better evidence. we recommend a reinforcement of preventive measures against tetanus infection and it is hoped that in the light of clear evidence about the preventive efficacy of tetanus toxoid immunization, concerted efforts should be made towards preventive interventions and ultimate eradication such that there will not be enough case materials for a trial. in the event of a need for a trial, a large prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which compares diazepam alone with combinations of other drugs (excluding diazepam) will be ideal.

","epidural analgesia provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. it reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half. the occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, gastric complications and renal complications was reduced by epidural analgesia. however, current evidence does not confirm the beneficial effect of epidural analgesia on postoperative mortality and other types of complications.

","in some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. the nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.

","there is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for acute mania. from the limited data available, there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone. some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole. referring to tolerability, when considering the poor evidence comparing drugs, clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profiles as an important issue to inform their choice.

","honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. honey might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.

","antibiotics for copd exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an icu. however, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. the risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. these inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.

","there may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific ige to eggs. little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. in addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults.

","no definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. the evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. we conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. however, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.

","compared with placebo, combination therapy led to a significant reduction of a quarter in exacerbation rates. there was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with the addition of data from the torch trial. the increased risk of pneumonia is a concern, and better reporting of this outcome in future studies would be helpful. in order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler more data are necessary, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different doses of inhaled corticosteroids.

","evidence for the effectiveness of sgas is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo, which shows a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy, which suggest equivalence between the two interventions. the lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of sgas for sad. further larger rcts are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other sgas. data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. therefore the data we obtained on adverse effects is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited. overall, up to 27% of participants treated with sgas for sad withdrew from the studies early due to adverse effects. the overall quality of evidence in this review is very low.

","at present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for cr cbz over ir cbz for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. for trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed ir cbz, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of cr cbz with respect to seizure frequency. there is a trend for cr cbz to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to ir cbz. a change to cr cbz may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on ir cbz but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. the included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion. randomised controlled trials comparing cr cbz to ir cbz and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of cbz preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.

","epidural analgesia may be useful for postoperative pain relief following major lower limb joint replacements. however, the benefits may be limited to the early (four to six hours) postoperative period. an epidural infusion of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic-narcotic mixture may be better than epidural narcotic alone. the magnitude of pain relief must be weighed against the frequency of adverse events. the current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the frequency of rare complications from epidural analgesia, postoperative morbidity or mortality, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.

","complete avoidance of breastfeeding is efficacious in preventing mtct of hiv, but this intervention has significant associated morbidity (e.g., diarrheal morbidity if formula is prepared without clean water). if breastfeeding is initiated, two interventions 1). exclusive breastfeeding during the first few months of life; and 2) extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant (nevirapine alone, or nevirapine with zidovudine) are efficacious in preventing transmission.

","this review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. this treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective.

","implications for practice: nippv is a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of ncpap in preterm infants. its use reduces the incidence of symptoms of extubation failure more effectively than ncpap. within the limits of the small numbers of infants randomised to nippv there is a reassuring absence of the gastrointestinal side effects that were reported in previous case series. implications for research: future trials should enroll a sufficient number of infants to detect differences in important outcomes such as chronic lung disease and gastrointestinal perforation. the impact of synchronisation of nippv on the technique's safety and efficacy should be established in future trials.

","according to the results, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. however, height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention. there is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. for instance, there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. however, though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation, haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year. the conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. the authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases.

","u and lmw heparins protect against lower limb dvt. there is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin. foot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent dvt, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem. good quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered.

","perioperative chemotherapy for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma increases survival compared to surgery alone. it should thus be offered to all eligible patients. there is a trend to a larger survival advantage for tumors of the ge junction as compared to other sites and for chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in esophageal and ge junction tumors. likewise, there is an interaction between age and treatment effect, with younger patients having a larger survival advantage, and no survival advantage for elderly patients.

","placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for copd patients as individual therapies. this review, which included trials allowing comparisons between laba and ics, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. on the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. this review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for copd, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.

","peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis c and stable hiv who have not received treatment for hepatitis c as the intervention may clear the blood of hcv rna. supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. there is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.

","bronchodilators do not improve oxygen saturation, do not reduce hospital admission after outpatient treatment, do not shorten the duration of hospitalization and do not reduce the time to resolution of illness at home. the small improvements in clinical scores for outpatients must be weighed against the costs and adverse effects of bronchodilators.

","a few non-invasive physical treatments may be effective as prophylactic treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. based on trial results, these treatments appear to be associated with little risk of serious adverse effects. the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods. the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that the results of a few additional high-quality trials in the future could easily change the conclusions of our review.

","recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. this review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses. well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.

","considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in parkinson's disease. another cochrane review, physiotherapy for patients with parkinson's disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. a wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of uk physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of parkinson's disease (plant 1999). therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for parkinson's disease. the efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. after this large rcts are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. the trials should be reported according to consort guidelines (consort 1996).

","this review suggests topical steroids for nasal polyposis in patients with cystic fibrosis have no demonstrable effect on subjective nasal symptom scores. they have some effect in reducing the size of the polyps, but due to the small sample size, poor study completion rates and lack of follow-up, the study is at high risk of bias and evidence for efficacy is limited. overall there is no clear evidence for using topical steroids in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. a well-designed randomised controlled trial of adequate power and long-term follow-up is needed. validated measures of symptoms and physical findings should be performed and quality of life issues addressed.

","in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, ability to achieve surgery with complete cytoreduction (no visible residual disease) is associated with significant improvement in overall survival. however, in the absence of rct evidence, it is not clear whether this is solely due to surgical effect or due to tumour biology. indirect evidence would support surgery to achieve complete cytoreduction in selected women. the risks of major surgery need to be carefully balanced against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis.

","this review found that programmes to promote smoke alarms have at most modest beneficial effects on smoke alarm ownership and function, and no demonstrated beneficial effect on fires or fire-related injuries. counselling as part of child health surveillance has a somewhat greater effect on smoke alarm ownership and function, but its effects on injuries are unevaluated. community smoke alarm give-away programmes have not been demonstrated to increase smoke alarm prevalence or to reduce fires or fire-related injuries. community-based education programmes have not been shown to reduce burns or fire-related injuries. community smoke alarm installation programmes may increase the prevalence of working alarms and reduce fire-related injuries, but these results require confirmation, and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes has not been evaluated. efforts to promote smoke alarms through installation programmes should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes and cost-effectiveness.

","surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. more and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.

","concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ics/laba over laba alone in preventing exacerbations. the effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. there was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ics/laba. there was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and fev1 improved more on ics/laba than on laba, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. to an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations. more information would be useful on the relative benefits and adverse event rates with combination inhalers using different doses of inhaled corticosteroids. evidence from head-to-head comparisons is needed to assess the comparative risks and benefits of the different combination inhalers.

","sulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active crohn's disease. olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. high dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. high dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. in conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active crohn's disease. however, the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.

","whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses to follow up. health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. for example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.

","the quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus h2 antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric ph. however, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes. these findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.

","extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used ayre spatula. the most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. the rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. the ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.

","there is no evidence, either supporting or refuting the use of bed rest at home or in hospital, to prevent preterm birth. although bed rest in hospital or at home is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence that this practice could be beneficial. due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, clinicians should not routinely advise women to rest in bed to prevent preterm birth. potential benefits and harms should be discussed with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth. appropriate research is mandatory. future trials should evaluate both the effectiveness of bed rest, and the effectiveness of the prescription of bed rest, to prevent preterm birth.

","there is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. the results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. the findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available: topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. in most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. however, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. in addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. the evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. further investigation is needed. given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. it may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. if they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.

","current evidence suggests that supplementary oxygen given to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is associated with higher maternal and neonatal oxygen levels (maternal spo2, pao2, uapo2 and uvpo2) and higher levels of oxygen free radicals. however, the intervention was neither beneficial nor harmful to the neonate's short-term clinical outcome as assessed by apgar scores.

","there is good evidence that both ert and hrt do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. it is not known whether either specific types of ert or hrt have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory. there is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment. it remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. in addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. large rcts currently underway in the usa may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. in the meantime, based on the available evidence, ert or hrt cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment.

","calcitonin appears to preserve bone mass in the first year of glucocorticoid therapy at the lumbar spine by about 3% compared to placebo, but not at the femoral neck. our analysis suggests that the protective effect on bone mass may be greater for the treatment of patients who have been taking corticosteroids for more than three months. efficacy of calcitonin for fracture prevention in steroid-induced osteoporosis remains to be established.

","diuretics are preferred first-line over ccbs to optimize reduction of cardiovascular events. the review does not distinguish between ccbs, ace inhibitors or arbs, but does provide evidence supporting the use of ccbs over β-blockers. many of the differences found in the current review are not robust and further trials might change the conclusions. more well-designed rcts studying the mortality and morbidity of patients taking ccbs as compared with other antihypertensive drug classes are needed for patients with different stages of hypertension, different ages, and with different co-morbidities such as diabetes.

","there is some evidence of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration and icu los with use of standardized protocols, but there is significant heterogeneity among studies and an insufficient number of studies to investigate the source of this heterogeneity. although some study authors suggest that organizational context may influence outcomes, these factors were not considered in all included studies and therefore could not be evaluated.

","well designed rcts, evaluating a high number of patients were included in the review. recombinant ifn beta does not prevent the development of permanent physical disability in spms. we were unable to verify the effect on cognitive function for the lack of comparable data. this treatment significantly reduces the risk of relapse and of short -term relapse-related disability. overall, these results show that ifns' anti-inflammatory effect is unable to retard progression, when established. in the future, no new rcts for ifns versus placebo in spms will probably be undertaken, because research is now focusing on innovative drugs. we believe that this review gives conclusive evidence on the clinical efficacy of ifns versus placebo in spms.

","haloperidol is a potent antipsychotic drug but has a high propensity to cause adverse effects. where there is no treatment option, use of haloperidol to counter the damaging and potentially dangerous consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified. however, where a choice of drug is available, people with schizophrenia and clinicians may wish to prescribe an alternative antipsychotic with less likelihood of adverse effects such as parkinsonism, akathisia and acute dystonias. haloperidol should not be a control drug of choice for randomised trials of new antipsychotics.

","the available data from the trials suggest that there is little difference between regular long term use of ipb alone and salmeterol if the aim is to improve copd symptoms and exercise tolerance. however, salmeterol was more effective in improving lung function variables. in terms of post-bronchodilator lung function, combination therapy conferred modest benefits, a significant improvement in hrql, and reduced supplemental short-acting beta-agonist requirement, although this effect was not consistent. additional studies are needed to assess the relative effects of combining therapies, using validated subjective measurements, and should consider concordance and the convenience of people having to use different inhaler devices.

","the evidence suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the titration regimen is 12 to 18 months. the titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the block-replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective. continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. immunosuppressive therapies need further evaluation.

","shouldice herniorrhaphy is the best non-mesh technique in terms of recurrence, though it is more time consuming and needs a slightly longer post-operative hospital stay. the use of mesh is associated with a lower rate of recurrence. the quality of included studies, assessed with jaded scale, were low. patients have similar characteristic in the treatment and control group but seems more healthy than in general population, this features may affect the dimension of effect in particularly recurrence rate could be higher in general population. lost to follow-up were similar in the treatment and control group but the reasons were often not reported. the length of follow-up vary broadly among the studies from 1 year to 13.7 year.

","the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin c reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out. nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin c on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them. further therapeutic rcts are warranted.

","the data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. for chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and ""alternative"" treatments. the data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.

","duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. no differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some ssris (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). this limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. as many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. as for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. in the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. given that several ssris and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.

","the available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for lbp. based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. when combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. from the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. it should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with lbp. further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.

","there is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. the quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. one such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4-<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. weak evidence suggests that low doses (≧2-<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. high doses (≧10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. we advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.

","both danazol and progesterone + oestrogen add-back have been shown to be protective of bmd, while on treatment and up to six and 12 months later, respectively. however, by 24 months of follow-up there was no difference in bmd in those women who had hrt add-back. studies of danazol versus gnrha did not report long-term follow-up. the significant side effects associated with danazol limit its use.

","the most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.

","this review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. for presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. there is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.

","the available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. in addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. one small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. there is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. the single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side effects.

","the results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.

","combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be a viable option for patients of good performance status with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, but further trials that report adequate survival and qol data are sought. response rates and improvements in survival are low. cisplatin-based combinations have significant toxicity. outcomes are poor and novel cytotoxic/biological agents and optimal scheduling need further investigation. future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence.

","the best evidence suggests that newer treatments including terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole may be similar to griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis caused by trichophyton species. newer treatments may be preferred because shorter treatment durations may improve treatment adherence, although they may be more expensive. there is not enough evidence on the use of systemic treatments in children with microsporum infections. not all treatments for tinea capitis are available in paediatric formulations but all have reasonable safety profiles.

","universal initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated on the available evidence. there is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications including stroke. the higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each person.

","we found no evidence of a difference in mortality, 'clinically significant' or 'severe bleeding', transfusion reactions or adverse events between pathogen-reduced and standard platelets. for a range of laboratory outcomes the results indicated evidence of some benefits for standard platelets over pathogen-reduced platelets. these conclusions are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. given the variability in trial design, bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting, it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up, including safety reporting.

","ebrt reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. it is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. there is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant ebrt for high-risk stage i endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. ebrt may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (ia/b grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. for the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, vbt alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to ebrt. further research is needed to guide practice for lesions that are truly high risk. in addition, the definitions of risk should be standardised.

","problems following abi vary. consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to suit the needs of patients with different problems. patients presenting acutely to hospital with moderate to severe brain injury should be routinely followed up to assess their needs for rehabilitation. intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains. the balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation should have access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs. those with milder brain injury benefit from follow up and appropriate information and advice. not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. some questions include which treatments work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. in future, such questions will need to be set alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic, longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.

","from the single, small and ill-reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. currently, the value of this way of supporting people - which could be considerable - is unclear. trials are needed. any 24 hour care 'ward-in-a-house' is likely to be oversubscribed. we argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. with follow-up of all eligible for the placements - those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care - real-world evaluation could take place. in the uk further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. the broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches.

","there is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. it does not reduce the risk of stroke. the conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (>60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.

","we are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. for both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. more research is needed. for other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.

","alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates.

","topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for crs without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. it may be included in a comprehensive treatment of crs without polyps. direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.

","given the generally poor quality of the published studies and the large degree of heterogeneity in the interventions and the results, the overall benefit of pentoxifylline for patients with fontaine class ii intermittent claudication remains uncertain. pentoxifylline is generally well tolerated. based on the totality of the available evidence, it is possible that pentoxifylline could have a place in the treatment of ic as a means of improving walking distance and as a complimentary treatment assuming all other essential measures such as lifestyle change, exercise and treatment for secondary prevention have been taken into account. however, the response to pentoxifylline should be assessed on an individual basis.

","rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. however, this finding is based on one small study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. it therefore cannot be routinely recommended. reflexology appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again this is based on one small study (43 women). external compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema.

","there is moderate to strong evidence that vr is a safe, effective management for unilateral peripheral vestibular dysfunction, based on a number of high quality randomised controlled trials. there is moderate evidence that vr provides a resolution of symptoms and improvement in functioning in the medium term. however, there is evidence that for the specific diagnostic group of bppv, physical (repositioning) manoeuvres are more effective in the short term than exercise-based vestibular rehabilitation; although a combination of the two is effective for longer-term functional recovery. there is insufficient evidence to discriminate between differing forms of vr.

","data from rcts comparing ias to cas are limited by small sample size and short duration. there are no data for the relative effectiveness of ias versus cas for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. limited information suggests ias may have slightly reduced adverse events. overall, ias was also as effective as cas for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).

","our results confirm that pdis are responsible for an increase in mortality rate compared with placebo in patients suffering from chronic heart failure. currently available results do not support the hypothesis that the increased mortality rate is due to additional vasodilator treatment. consequently, the chronic use of pdis should be avoided in heart failure patients.

","there is some evidence of no difference in mortality between norepinephrine and dopamine. dopamine appeared to increase the risk for arrhythmia. there is not sufficient evidence of any difference between any of the six vasopressors examined. probably the choice of vasopressors in patients with shock does not influence the outcome, rather than any vasoactive effect per se. there is not sufficient evidence that any one of the investigated vasopressors is clearly superior over others.

","there should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. there is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. the evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. if the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm). more evidence with low risk of bias is needed. future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. as it is unethical to propose rcts to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. however, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies.

","differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. in day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. there is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.

","in conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that treatment with vitamin k antagonists reduces the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism for as long as it is used. however, the absolute risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism declines over time, while the risk for major bleeding remains. thus, the efficacy of vitamin k antagonist administration decreases over time since the index event.

","evidence from a small number of trials suggests that dipyrone is effective for etth and migraine. no serious adverse events were observed in the included trials, but agranulocytosis is rare and would probably not be observed in such a relatively small sample. a study now ongoing in latin america may clarify the true risk of agranulocytosis associated with dipyrone use.

","the risk of bias was high in most of the included trials and poor reporting quality and inadequate data did not permit comprehensive and reliable conclusions to be made. future trials should be well-constructed and pay more attention to the methods used to assess outcomes, the timing of the assessments, and the quality of reporting and subsequent analysis of the data.

","we found insufficient evidence that hormonal treatment in any form, dose or as part of combination therapy improves the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. however, a large number of patients would be needed to demonstrate an effect on survival and none of the included rcts had a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a significant difference. in the absence of a proven survival advantage and the heterogeneity of patient populations, the decision to use any type of hormonal therapy should be individualised and with the intent to palliate the disease. it is debatable whether outcomes such as quality of life, treatment response or palliative measures such as relieving symptoms should take preference over overall and pfs as the major objectives of future trials.

","the pooled analyses suggest that peg preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. grade analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow up. however, peg appears safe and well tolerated. there is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil), which was also well tolerated.there is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. further research is needed to investigate the long term use of peg for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin.

","this review shows that xpert used as an initial diagnostic test for tb detection and rifampicin resistance detection in patients suspected of having tb, mdr-tb, or hiv-associated tb is sensitive and specific. xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test following microscopy for patients who have previously been found to be smear-negative. an xpert result that is positive for rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of mdr-tb in a given patient and the expected prevalence of mdr-tb in a given setting. studies in this review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in reference laboratories in research investigations. most studies were performed in high tb burden countries. ongoing use of xpert in high tb burden countries will contribute to the evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care settings, including settings where the test is performed at the point of care.

","we could demonstrate a benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient's age and the type of internal shunt used. the benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. however this data derives from the rate of shunt infection, which is an intermediary outcome. future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo, and should include all-cause mortality, shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. evidence suggests that antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well-designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic-impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit.

","non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) including aspirin were better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. nsaids were better than paracetamol and paracetamol was not better than placebo, though numbers of participants for these comparisons were small. data for opioids compared with nsaids and opioids compared with placebo were conflicting, with some measures showing similar effect and others indicating nsaids were better than opioids and opioids were not better than placebo. there were insufficient data to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution. the median year of publication of included studies was 1981; therefore more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of current pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesia at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth.

","the pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. however, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. it seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.

","there is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly cbt, for treating ptsd in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. at this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. there is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others. the findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. in addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses. more evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. more details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of ptsd and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of ptsd symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported.

","overall, there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults. 'moderate' quality evidence suggests that there is no clear difference in the rate of major re-operations and complications between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing. reamed intramedullary nailing has, however, a lower incidence of implant failure than unreamed nailing. 'low' quality evidence suggests that reamed nailing may reduce the incidence of major re-operations related to non-union in closed fractures rather than in open fractures. 'low' quality evidence suggests that the ender nail has poorer results in terms of re-operation and malunion than an interlocking nail.

","there is evidence that supportive interventions may help reduce caregivers' psychological distress. these findings suggest that practitioners should enquire about the concerns of caregivers and should consider that they may benefit from additional support. there is, however, a need for further research to explore the benefits identified, and to assess the interventions' effects on physical health, and potential harms. trials need to report their methods fully.

","the evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. the simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. the various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. as women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.

","there is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. in people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. if further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.

","current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.

","meta-analysis demonstrates that topiramate in a 100 mg/day dosage is effective in reducing headache frequency and reasonably well-tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. this provides good evidence to support its use in routine clinical management. more studies designed specifically to compare the efficacy or safety of topiramate versus other interventions with proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine are needed.

","in keeping with previous world health organization (who) recommendations everything possible should be done to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients, while recognising that this may not be sufficient to correct specific micronutrient deficiencies in all hiv-infected individuals. specific recommendations for pregnant and lactating women infected with hiv would be to include the provision of multivitamin supplements in single rda formulations during the antenatal period and at least for 6 weeks post-partum, especially for women who are breast-feeding. there is no conclusive evidence to provide stand-alone zinc or selenium supplementation to hiv-infected pregnant and lactating women. micronutrient supplementation should not be used as a substitute for provision of recommended antiretroviral medication for preventing mother-to-child transmission of hiv and treating maternal hiv infection when this is recommended. further trials of single supplements are required to build the evidence base. the long-term clinical benefits, adverse effects, and optimal formulation of multiple micronutrient supplements require further investigation in pregnant women at different stages of hiv infection.

","one definition of active management includes directions to administer an uterotonic with birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby and to clamp the umbilical cord within 30-60 seconds of birth of the baby (which is not always feasible in practice). in this review delaying clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. in addition, late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor, although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.
