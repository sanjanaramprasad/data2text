|PUNCHLINE_TEXT when accompanied by feedback counseling |PUNCHLINE_TEXT was an effective health promotion tool to help prevent nonsmokers from acquiring the habit and to modify cigarette smoking

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Seventeen percent of the smokers enrolled in the clinics had reports of having quit smoking for at least the last 30 days at 3-month follow-up (5 months after the program quit day)

Despite a failure to demonstrate differences among groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was some suggestion that immediately after treatment EMD was superior for intrusive memories. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Successful treatment was faster with EMDR as a larger number of people (7 of 10) had a 70% reduction in PTSD symptoms after three active sessions compared to 2 of 12 with PE. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Posttraumatic stress symptoms decreased by at least 1 level of clinical severity in 65% of the treatment group compared with symptoms worsening or not changing in 69% of controls (chi(2)(1) = 12.80; P<.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Pre-post effect sizes for the EMDR group averaged 1.56 compared to 0.65 for the AL group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The 2 therapies had similar results except that

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT and in some comorbid conditions. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT These results indicate that NET is a promising approach for the treatment of PTSD for refugees living in unsafe conditions. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All 3 active treatments reduced severity of PTSD and depression compared with WL but did not differ significantly from each other |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and these gains were maintained throughout the follow-up period. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Primary analyses based on all available data indicated that participants in the treatment condition showed a significantly greater decline in traumatic

contribution to the analgesic effectiveness of the combination on all measures of efficacy (sum of pain intensity differences |PUNCHLINE_TEXT largest pain intensity difference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT total pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT largest pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and time to remedication). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Statistical significance was only seen for the parameter pain intensity (SPID) on comparison of suprofen 100 mg + APAP 650 mg versus suprofen 200 mg. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for Sum Pain Intensity Difference (SPID) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT  |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ibuprofen liquigel 200 and 400 mg were also significantly more efficacious than acetaminophen 1000 mg on the summary measures TOTPAR 6 and SPID 6 (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Oral surgery pain is a reliable model to reference the effectiveness of commonly used analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ibuprofen was found to be the most effective analgesic in post-episiotomy pain followed by analgin and paracetamol in that order. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Propacetamol bolus resulted in a much higher incidence of local adverse events than the infusion (propacetamol bolus 90% vs propacetamol infusion 52%) with no clinically significant benefits in terms of analgesic efficacy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All four active treatments were statistically superior to placebo for sum pain intensity difference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT total relief of pain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and overall evaluation parameters. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Overall |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the combination was slightly better than acetaminophen alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ibuprofen lysine had a significantly (P < or = 0.05) faster onset of action with greater peak and overall analgesic effect than did effect than did acetaminophen. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At 4 hours after administration |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the pain relief was significantly better with tablet acetaminophen than with effervescent acetaminophen. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for the sum of pain intensity difference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT total pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and reduction of pain by more than 50% (P less than .05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT suggesting a more rapid onset of action and a more prolonged effect by ibuprofen 400 mg. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Analgesia was similar for ketorolac 10 and 20 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg; however |PUNCHLINE_TEXT these treatments were superior to acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Paracetamol and rofecoxib combined improved the analgesic effect compared with rofecoxib alone for the first 1.5 h. Rofecoxib alone and the combination of paracetamol and rofecoxib had a significantly better analgesic effect than paracetamol alone from 3 h onwards. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For most pain intensity and pain relief measurements |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1000 mg acetaminophen was statistically superior to placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT demonstrating assay sensitivity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 10 and 25 mg doses of bromfenac were statistically better than both placebo and 5 mg bromfenac for ordinal and analog ratings of pain intensity and pain relief; 25 mg bromfenac produced significantly longer time to remedication than acetaminophen. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although efficacy was lower for the acetaminophen-phenyltoloxamine combination than for acetaminophen alone |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for every variable |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the contrast for interaction was not statistically significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were few adverse effects other than sedation |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which occurred twice as frequently in patients treated with nalbuphine as in those receiving acetaminophen or placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In addition |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both ibuprofen and ketoprofen showed statistical superiority over acetaminophen at earlier time points on the time-effect curves for pain relief and pain intensity difference. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin and paracetamol were more rapid than piroxicam in inducing analgesia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A positive dose-effect relationship was evident for both acetaminophen 500 mg. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Statistically significant pain relief (mean pain intensity differences and sum of pain intensity differences) was seen in the group receiving paracetamol compared to those receiving placebo or tiaramide from 1 h to 6 h after drug ingestion. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in patients with moderate baseline pain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no differences were found between the study drugs in any of the analgesic efficacy variables. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both doses of flurbiprofen resulted in significant analgesia in comparison with placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT acetaminophen |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and acetaminophen plus codeine as measured by pain intensity difference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and global evaluation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Acetaminophen was significantly better than aspirin with respect to the maximum difference in the intensity of pain (P less than 0.05) and the maximum pain relief achieved (P less than 0.03) and according to the global evaluation (P less than 0.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT (R)- Ketoprofen possesses analgesic activity and an acceptable side-effect profile in the oral surgery pain model. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Statistical analyses indicated better analgesic efficacy in both PID and SPID scores for the orphenadrine-acetaminophen combination over the three other treatments. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Time to remedication |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a measure of duration of analgesic effect |PUNCHLINE_TEXT was significantly longer (P < 0.001) with naproxen sodium (median |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 9.9 hours) than with either acetaminophen (median |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3.1 hours) or placebo (median |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.0 hours). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Flurbiprofen in 50 mg and 100 mg dosages demonstrated effective analgesic activity with the 100 mg dosage being at least as effective as the acetaminophen/codeine combination. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mean scores for the summary variable percent sum of the pain intensity differences (% SPID) were higher in all for the combination than for acetaminophen alone |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and in two studies the null hypothesis of no differences was rejected. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both nalbuphine and acetaminophen were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of total and peak analgesia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The 100 and 50 mg doses of ketoprofen and the combination were statistically superior to acetaminophen and placebo for many analgesic measures. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The most important finding was the statistically significantly shorter period until the onset of the action of paracetamol as against acetyl salicylic acid. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Codeine 60 mg was not consistently superior to placebo in this post-operative single dose analysis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The combination product was significantly (p less than 0.05) superior to either butorphanol (4 mg) or acetaminophen (650 mg) as well as placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The combination was significantly superior to acetaminophen alone for all analgesic measures including SPID |PUNCHLINE_TEXT TOTAL |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and global ratings. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to the number of patients requiring rescue medication |PUNCHLINE_TEXT however the time to dosing was significantly longer for those taking soluble aspirin when compared with placebo (hazard ratio 2.34 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI 1.41 to 3.88 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Pain relief after the initial dose of diclofenac-K (2 x 12.5 mg) was superior to placebo (P < .01 for all efficacy outcomes) and comparable to paracetamol (2 x 500 mg). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At 3 and 4 hours |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the acetaminophen/aspirin combination as well as the aspirin/caffeine combination were significantly superior to acetaminophen alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Flurbiprofen was significantly superior to the acetaminophen codeine combination with respect to the number of hours until remedication. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For many efficacy variables |PUNCHLINE_TEXT all active treatments were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective than placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of analgesia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and their effects were significant for 4 and 5 hours respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both doses of diflunisal were significantly more effective than acetaminophen alone and produced peak analgesia comparable to that of the acetaminophen-codeine combination. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT

surveys. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among time 1 ever smokers |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.23) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively] |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the two estimates were not significantly different. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The most important predictor of smoking for boys |PUNCHLINE_TEXT having a best friend who smoked |PUNCHLINE_TEXT was significant on application of the chi 2 test (P 0.037) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although it was non-significant when included singly in a logistic regression model (0.094); the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the California Tobacco Surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The more advertisements identified at baseline |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the greater was the risk of being a smoker (p<0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In girls |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% CL |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -17.3% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% CL |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -18.9% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.7%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT after two years. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour |PUNCHLINE_TEXT beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For each 1-SD increase in novelty seeking |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie |PUNCHLINE_TEXT being in a specific category or higher) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among non-smokers |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the belief that smoking is fun |PUNCHLINE_TEXT peers |PUNCHLINE_TEXT siblings and mother consumption |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among the cohort |PUNCHLINE_TEXT baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0004) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Adolescents who |PUNCHLINE_TEXT at baseline |PUNCHLINE_TEXT owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant interaction effects between pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on smoking susceptibility were found. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Less than 5% (n=92) at baseline possessed a promotional item but a further 10%(n=172) were willing to use an item. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for White (susceptibility and ever smoking) and African American (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for Hispanic adolescents. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Adjusting for multiple risk factors |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among experimental smokers |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the majority (64%) were receptive to

mood disturbance when compared with placebo-treated patients; |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant relief of both pain and paresthesia was obtained with this combination. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT We found good to excellent pain relief in 16 of 24 patients (p less than or equal to 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both clomipramine and desipramine significantly reduced the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by observer- and self rating in comparison with placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The plasma levels of imipramine and its metabolite desipramine were significantly higher in patients who benefited from imipramine treatment. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results after three months of treatment showed that clomipramine: (1) was better than amitriptyline in treating trigeminal neuralgia; (2) tended to be better in the treatment of tension headache; and (3) amitriptyline is better in treating postherpatic neuralgia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Amitriptyline was slightly better than maprotiline (p < .05) [tested by repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Citalopram significantly relieved the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by both observer- and self-rating in comparison with placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mianserin plus desmethylmianserin plasma concentration ranged from 85 to 850 nmol.l-1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with the highest concentration in a patient who was a poor metabolizer of both sparteine and mephenytoin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in pain intensity reduction between the maximum tolerated dose of venlafaxine (75 mg in most cases) and the placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The sum of the individual pain scores during treatment week 4 was lower on venlafaxine (80% of baseline score; p = 0.006) and imipramine (77%; p = 0.001) than on placebo (100%) and did not show any statistical difference between venlafaxine and imipramine (p = 0.44). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Gabapentin produced greater pain reductions than amitriptyline (mean final scores were 1.9 vs. 1.3 points below baseline scores; P = 0.026). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT None of the individual pain ratings were significantly changed by St. John's wort as compared to placebo (P=0.09--0.33). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Amitriptyline reduced the depression scores in the depressed group but had no effect on the depression scores in the non-depressed group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For both the acupuncture and amitriptyline comparisons |PUNCHLINE_TEXT changes in pain score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no substantial differences between the two treatments in Spitzer's quality of life score and for each item. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The average daily pain intensity as reported in the diary (primary outcome) was not significantly reduced by venlafaxine compared with placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant changes were noted in reported pain measures between patients allocated to the active drug group and those given placebo during the course of the protocol. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A statistically significant decrease was seen in pain in Groups 1 and 2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and no significant changes were seen in Groups 3 and 4. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Treatment with imipramine hydrochloride or amitriptyline hydrochloride resulted in complete remission of lower extremity pains in all patients in 10 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between the groups in treatment effects for pain or pain-related symptoms. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The placebo group showed a pain rate of 21% within 1 year after the diagnosis of thalamic stroke compared with 17% in the group under prophylactic treatment with amitriptyline. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Greater relief was associated with higher amitriptyline doses |PUNCHLINE_TEXT up to the maximum dose of 150 mg/d |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and with higher serum tricyclic levels. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Results showed that early treatment with low-dose amitriptyline reduced pain prevalence by more than one-half (p < 0.05; odds ratio |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.9:1) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The differences in responses between amitriptyline and desipramine and between fluoxetine and placebo were not statistically significant |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but both amitriptyline and desipramine were superior to placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Neither amitriptyline nor mexiletine provide significant pain relief in patients with HIV-associated painful sensory neuropathy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All 3 treatment regimens resulted in a significant improvement from baseline in burning mouth symptoms at week 8 as demonstrated by the quantitative (mean reduction in VAS |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HAM-D |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and HAM-A scores) and qualitative (percentage of responders) analyses. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT We found no difference with regard to relief of steady |PUNCHLINE_TEXT brief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or skin pain by visual analog scales for pain and pain relief; mood; disability; satisfaction; or preference between the two drugs. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No statistically significant differences were observed between both therapies for either pain or paresthesia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Side effects were troublesome with both agents. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Distigmine alone also decreased pain and increased saliva flow |PUNCHLINE_TEXT sometimes to the point of discomfort |PUNCHLINE_TEXT whereas amitriptyline alone |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in this particular series |PUNCHLINE_TEXT did not significantly reduce pain and produced unpleasant mouth dryness. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Five of the 14 patients treated with carbamazepine reported some pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The 'poor responders' reported significantly more adverse effects with amitriptyline and placebo than the good responders. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The areas of allodynia and pin-prick hyperalgesia decreased significantly in venlafaxine groups compared to the placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidence of adverse events for all patients was similar in both groups (tramadol 76.5%; clomipramine with or without levomepromazine 83.3%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although both drugs provide pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mean pain score and global pain score data indicate no significant difference between gabapentin and amitriptyline. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The therapeutic analgesic efficacy of the two drugs proved to be similar. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a significant decrease in the incidence of chest wall pain (55% vs. 19% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0002) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT arm pain (45% vs. 17% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.003) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and axilla pain (51% vs. 19% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0009) between the control group and the venlafaxine group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results showed the superiority of dothiepin over placebo in achieving pain relief; 71% of patients were pain free in the dothiepin group at nine weeks compared with 47% in the placebo group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Mean VAS-PR scores in the 150-225 mg group were significantly greater than placebo at week 6 (44 vs 60 mm; P < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT By the end of the study |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the interference with daily activities by pain had diminished significantly (P = .001) in both groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT including improvements in sleeping and walking. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Despite some adverse effects |PUNCHLINE_TEXT especially of an anticholinergic nature |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the patients generally preferred imipramine to placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Side effects experienced with bupropion SR were not dose-limiting and consisted primarily of dry mouth |PUNCHLINE_TEXT insomnia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT headache |PUNCHLINE_TEXT gastrointestinal upset |PUNCHLINE_TEXT tremor |PUNCHLINE_TEXT constipation |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and dizziness. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Neither paroxetine nor imipramine caused changes in objective measures of peripheral nerve function. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Subjective reports indicated a greater reduction in pain at 2 and 4 weeks on amitriptyline |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but no difference at 6 weeks. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results clearly indicate the better analgesic effect of tricyclic antidepressants over placebo (p less than 0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT More patients completing all three treatments preferred opioids (54%) than TCA (30%; p = 0.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Nineteen patients completed both treatments; 12 reported at least moderate relief with desipramine and two reported relief with placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Overall pain was significantly reduced by doxepin |PUNCHLINE_TEXT capsaicin and doxepin/capsaicin to a similar extent. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT It seems possible that clomipramine activates serotonin-containing neurons of the endorphin-mediated analgesia system that control pain transmission in the CNS. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT

hematoma |PUNCHLINE_TEXT infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or recurrence during the follow-up period in two arms. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both procedures can be safely performed in pilonidal disease with a standard length of stay in hospital and a similar loss of productive power. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The recurrence rate was also significantly lower in patients who underwent Limberg rotation flap (p = 0.005). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Excision and primary closure of chronic pilonidal sinus causes less morbidity and is more cost effective than excision and open packing. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Initial primary healing was significantly more frequent after excision and primary closure (45/46; 98%) compared with excision and healing by secondary granulation (36/50; 72%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Short-term results showed 6 (12.0%) post-operative complications in group A vs 10 (20.0%) in group B. Long-term results showed 9 (18.0%) complications in group A vs 7 (14.0%) in group B.

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT which also had the highest postoperative D-dimer levels. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT It was also shown that autotransfusion without aspirin does reduce the need for donor blood transfusion without any increase in post-operative bleeding. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The fibrin degradation products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Global coagulation tests |PUNCHLINE_TEXT antithrombin III |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and total serum protein were comparable in the four groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Whilst auto-transfusion does not appear to compromise haemostasis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT it does not reduce the requirement for homologous blood and heparin-bonding of the circuit has no impact. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Group 1 required 15 units of bank blood |PUNCHLINE_TEXT group 2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 90 units (p < 0.001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and group 3 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 102 units (p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3-DPG levels decreased from 4.3 to 3.9 mumol/ml erythrocyte during the same period. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Total intra-hospital homologous blood replacement was not significantly different |PUNCHLINE_TEXT  |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Their administration caused a significant increase in TAT and FPA levels in groups 2 and 3 compared to group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Use of cell saver reduced intraoperative net blood loss and seemed to reduce transfusions by 1 unit per patient |PUNCHLINE_TEXT however |PUNCHLINE_TEXT this was probably attributable to more complications leading to transfusion in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The use of any blood product was avoided in 95% and 80% of the patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively (not significant). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was an average saving of 1.1 unit of allogeneic blood per patient in group A (p<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no statistically significant difference in transfusion requirements or wound complications among the four groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fibrin split products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Only 7% of patients in the autotransfusion group required an allogeneic transfusion compared with 28% in the control group (P<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no detrimental effects of autologous blood transfusion. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no relationship between retransfusions and postoperative febrile reactions. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The estimated blood loss and Cell Saver return volumes were less for those patients undergoing AFB for occlusive disease compared with those undergoing AFB for aneurysmal disease. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Homologous blood transfusion was required in only 35% of patients in the study group compared with 95% of patients in the control group (P less than 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The postoperative drainage and transfusion device was efficacious in reducing the amount of allogeneic red cells required by patients undergoing knee arthroplasty |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and

infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT deep-vein thrombosis and chest infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT was also comparable between the groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic blood (32% in both groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT relative risk 1.0 P = 0.89). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The amount of postoperative autologous blood salvage averaged 946 mL. Only 25% of the study group required postoperative transfusions |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared to 83% of the control group (P = .016). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidence of re-exploration was zero in both the groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients who received autologous blood had higher levels of haemoglobin at 8 hours (p < 0.05) and 24 hours postoperatively (p < 0.01) and needed less allogeneic blood transfusion (p < 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in the postoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin values between the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were seen between the groups in any of the parameters measured. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No complications or adverse effects were observed from reinfusion. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significantly more allogeneic blood was required by the control group than by the reinfusion group (p = 0.022). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 32 of the patients in the intraoperative cell salvage group were given any blood product |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with 47 in the control group (odds ratio 0.47 (0.25 to 0.89); P=0.019). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The two groups were comparable with regard to age |PUNCHLINE_TEXT sex |PUNCHLINE_TEXT weight |PUNCHLINE_TEXT preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and surgical procedure. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No clinically significant intergroup differences were found in hematologic |PUNCHLINE_TEXT renal or hepatic parameters |PUNCHLINE_TEXT neurologic function or use of antibiotics. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Evaluation of clotting studies showed no significant differences between patients who received shed blood and patients who received liquid-preserved red blood cells. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although both groups had a decrease in lung perfusion postoperatively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were no significant differences among the groups regarding the lung perfusion scintigraphy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT chest X-rays |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ABG |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and D-dimer values. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The amount of HB that was transfused during the operation was significantly lower in groups II and III than in group I (P less than 0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mean Hb concentration was significantly higher in group A on day 1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) did not increase |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma utilization also was less in the autotransfusion group than in the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but this did not reach statistical significance. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No differences were noted between two groups in terms of clinical parameters; likewise the operative characteristics were similar for the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 87.44 ml in the AT patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a reduction of 38.7% (p less than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At D + 1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the hematocrit was comparable in all groups (OGr = 28% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT SGr = 28.2% and CGr = 28.5%).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patient bleeding times were not significantly different between the groups at any of the time points |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the total postoperative blood loss was not different between the groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Eligible consecutive primary and revision total hip and knee replacement patients were randomized for one of the two systems or for a control group in which shed blood was not re-infused. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The number of patients requiring homologous blood transfusion was significantly different between the 2 groups (54/98 [55%] in autotransfused patients vs 73/100 [73%] in the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P =.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The use of blood conservation techniques resulted in reductions of homologous blood requirements of 34% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 60% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 80% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in groups II to IV as compared with the requirement in group I. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The length of stay was reduced in those patients who received autologous blood (9 days vs. 12 days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p < 0.05 Mann-Whitney U test). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT During the first 24 h after surgery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the autotransfusion group had a significantly higher serum level of CK-MB. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At 20 hours after surgery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT an increase of serum PCT concentration (>0.5-2 ng/mL) was more frequent in Group 2 (58.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.03). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The use of the autologous transfusion system (Bellovac) proved to be safe but failed to reduce the need for postoperative homologous blood transfusion following uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The chest tube drainage was significantly less in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with total drainage (median [interquartile range]) amounting to 250 mL |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the two groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significant difference in the mean blood loss was observed during 24 hours after the operation (660 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT C-reactive protein |PUNCHLINE_TEXT erythrocyte sedimentation rate |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and troponin-T increased after surgery in both groups without intergroup differences. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Postoperatively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in both groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT AT III |PUNCHLINE_TEXT plasminogen |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and protein C decreased. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between patients randomized to IAT and control patients in estimated blood loss (EBL) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT allogeneic blood transfusion (units administered intraoperatively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT postoperatively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and total) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT proportion of patients not receiving allogeneic blood (34% of patients randomized to IAT and 28% of control patients) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit levels |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and complications. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A cost comparison analysis showed that blood salvage was more expensive than PABT |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and therefore it should be limited to patients who had predeposited fewer than three units of autologous blood. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Use of autotransfusion effectively reduced the need for HBT and was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative SIRS and infective complications. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No statistical difference was found in the number of patients who had excessive postoperative drainage from a drained or non-drained wound. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The preoperative reservation of autoblood in patients with IHD for operations of coronary bypass under conditions of EC and using the cell saver gives higher values of hemoglobin and erythrocytes by the moment of discharge of the patients from the hospital |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but non the less does not reduce the frequency of using homologous blood. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The clinical safety of this technique was confirmed by the lack of septic |PUNCHLINE_TEXT hematological |PUNCHLINE_TEXT pulmonary |PUNCHLINE_TEXT renal |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or hepatic complications. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Conclusions Intraoperative cell salvage and autotransfusion was associated with higher postoperative hemoglobin concentrations |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a modest reduction in transfusion requirements |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no adverse clinical or coagulopathic effects |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and no significant increase in cost compared with controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Autotransfusion did not produce any significant derangement of thromboelastograph values or laboratory measures of clotting pathway function (prothrombin time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT activated partial thromboplastin time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT fibrinogen |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and fibrinogen D-dimer levels) when compared with the effect of homologous blood transfusion (p = NS |PUNCHLINE_TEXT repeated measures analysis of variance [MANOVA]). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in the mean post-operative haemoglobin levels in the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Off-pump CABG is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump CABG. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No complications or episodes of hypotension |PUNCHLINE_TEXT confusion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT cardiac or pulmonary compromise |PUNCHLINE_TEXT febrile reaction |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or coagulopathy were observed during or after the reinfusion of the unwashed |PUNCHLINE_TEXT filtered |PUNCHLINE_TEXT salvaged blood. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Additionally |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no statistically significant difference between hemoglobin levels and drainage volumes in both the THA and TKA study groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared to their respective control groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT These values in preoperatively collected autologous blood and allogeneic blood were out of normal range;

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT 18.5% (95% CI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 9% to 34%) for TC |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 36.6% (95% CI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 23% to 53%) for TCF (n = 119). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT With regard to toxicity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the FAM regimen produced more anorexia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT nausea |PUNCHLINE_TEXT vomiting |PUNCHLINE_TEXT leukopenia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT thrombocytopenia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and cumulative bone marrow

progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months |PUNCHLINE_TEXT time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (P = 0.4542) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and overall survival was 10.8 vs 8.3 months (P = 0.2818). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The median progression-free survival of all patients in the HD-FU |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HD-FU/FA |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and HD-FU/FA/Cis arm was 1.9 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 4.0 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 6.1

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Cessation prevalences were 35% in the intervention colleges and 16% in the control colleges when subjects with unknown quit status were defined as nonquitters. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (> or = 6-month) abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (ST) users. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prolonged abstinence from all tobacco was 6.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 3 months and 9.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 6 months in Manual only and Telephone Counseling |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Few adverse events led to discontinuation of

The intervention was significantly effective in preventing incident ST use but did not significantly increase cessation beyond that seen in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A significantly higher

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Long-term success was defined as no smokeless tobacco use at both 3- and 12-month follow-ups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with those lost to follow-up counted as smokeless tobacco users. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT We conclude that a tailored |PUNCHLINE_TEXT interactive Web-assisted cessation program can be an efficacious method for assisting adult ST users to quit. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The cessation

care (exact two sided p = 0.04). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The difference in relapse (no chewing for 7 consecutive days) between the active patch group (33%) and placebo group (48%) was significant at 6 months

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT for the LifeSign condition. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The authors found that the dental hygienist-delivered intervention was effective in getting smokeless tobacco users to quit at three and 12

from either SLT only or all tobacco products using outcomes based on either the responder or intention-to-treat outcomes. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results showed that the nicotine patch was effective in increasing short-term abstinence over the placebo patch and in reducing craving and withdrawal signs and symptoms from spit tobacco. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference between groups in the prevalence of ST initiation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Three- and 6-month follow-up contacts found that the cessation rates reported by intervention participants were double those reported by

radiological outcomes were similar |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the Holland nail group (DHS 4.3 days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT  |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At an average follow-up of 3.7 months all

mechanical complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the Gamma nail group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher

with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times |PUNCHLINE_TEXT fewer blood transfusions |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT More intra-operative complications were recorded in the Gamma nail group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of Chinese people. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT According to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Postoperative pain (p < 0.01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for DHS implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the

and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The reduction in the HRQOL (EQ-5D(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that

randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Time to relapse was significantly longer in quetiapine XR-treated patients versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.16 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Long-term treatment with asenapine was more effective than placebo in preventing relapse of schizophrenia and appeared to be safe and well tolerated. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although quetiapine was generally well tolerated |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the rate of discontinuation due to adverse or serious adverse events was greater in the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than in the

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT 46% relapsed |PUNCHLINE_TEXT as did 62% of those on placebo; the most important determinant of relapse was duration of illness prior to starting neuroleptic medication. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT These patients showed a significantly higher relapse rate than the matched control group of 26 patients who continued to receive fluphenazine (56% versus 19% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p less than .001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the placebo group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a 50% decrease in the mean haloperidol plasma concentration was seen 8 weeks after withdrawal of haloperidol. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a striking absence of correlation between dyskinesia change measures brought about by benztropine and changes following neuroleptic withdrawal. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The drug was shown to be significantly more effective than the placebo in preventing relapse. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The benzodiazepine-group had a significantly higher relapse rate than the neuroleptic-group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT meaning that we cannot

estimated 26-week risk of recurrence was six times lower for zotepine than placebo (8.7% versus 52.8%; hazard ratio 0.16 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI 0.053 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.484; P<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT To test the clinical efficacy of low dose fluphenazine decanoate (1.25 mg to 5.0 mg biweekly) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT we carried out two separate experiments: (1) an open trial in 57 schizophrenic outpatients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT lasting 6 months; (2) a double-blind |PUNCHLINE_TEXT placebo-controlled discontinuation study in a subgroup of patients who maintained good remission throughout the entire 6-month open trial. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For total scores on the TDI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT we were unable to demonstrate a significant reduction in thought pathology |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although it was evident that thought disorder as reflected in the Conceptual Disorganization and Unusual Thought Content subscales of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale is significantly reduced by neuroleptics. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A proportional hazards regression model showed that life events made a significant cumulative contribution over time (P < 0.05) to the risks of relapse and that ceasing medication made an independent contribution. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse and readmission to hospital. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The olanzapine group had a significantly longer time to relapse (P < 0.0001) than the placebo group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At the end of the 3-year trial |PUNCHLINE_TEXT both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Eighteen (69%) of the 26 patients available for follow-up (mean interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3.5 years) experienced a second psychotic relapse either during the study or afterward |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 50% (14/28) of the original sample experienced a third episode. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Social adjustment ratings on a special scale completed by the patients and families alike |PUNCHLINE_TEXT were also found to be insensitive to treatment differences. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Propericiazine at 10 mg and 30 mg also increased the number of symptom-free days dose-dependently but at 60 mg |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the number decreased. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Mean fluphenazine levels between drug continuation and withdrawal conditions showed a progressively larger difference over time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although significant differences were not seen until week 8. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The cumulative relapse-free survival was 88% (SE = 0.12) in the continuation and 18% (SE = 0.12) in the discontinuation group (P = 0.001) at 9 months follow-up. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Relapse was accompanied by a resurgence of specifically schizophrenic symptoms and by an increase in abnormalities described by the relatives. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A poor outcome at 2 years was associated with male sex |PUNCHLINE_TEXT poor outcome after the first 5 weeks of the first admission |PUNCHLINE_TEXT negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and a diagnosis of definite or probable schizophrenia using the Feighner criteria. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT

Children under 5 years of age whose families were not using chlorinated water had twice the risk of diarrhoea compared to children from the participating families (odds ratio = 1.98 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P

superior to placebo in measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems |PUNCHLINE_TEXT including abstention rates |PUNCHLINE_TEXT number of drinking days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT relapse |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and severity of alcohol-related problems. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT On an intention-to-treat basis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed a clear advantage in relapse rates for naltrexone over placebo (log-rank test |PUNCHLINE_TEXT chi(2)(1) = |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone showed trends (p < 0.10) toward a greater decrease in drinking days (binary outcome) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT alcohol craving |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and some liver enzyme levels than placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The most common adverse events (nausea and headache) occurred at a similar rate for patients in both treatment groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Drinking reductions at 3 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 6 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 12 months correlated with more use of coping skills |PUNCHLINE_TEXT lower urge |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and higher self-efficacy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of beta-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in beta-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although subjects in both groups reduced their consumption of both alcohol and cocaine during the 8-week trial |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no consistent advantage to NTX over placebo treatment. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Participants in any of the randomized groups who were entry abstainers had significantly better improvement on all of the primary outcome measures. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no differences in the frequency of any self-reported adverse effects or in liver enzyme values between the placebo- and naltrexone-treated groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Differential treatment effects were identified after stratification according to scores on the Alcohol Dependence Scale (ADS) and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the CBT-naltrexone group did better than the other groups on a variety of outcome measures. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although more subjects in the active medication groups terminated the study early secondary to adverse events |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the rates did not differ significantly from that of placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.72; 97.5% CI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.53-0.98; P = .02) over time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT most evident in those receiving medical management but not CBI. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Subjects treated with an active medication had significantly more consecutive weeks of abstinence and less craving than those treated with placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but there were no significant group differences in other measures of alcohol consumption. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone treated patients had significantly fewer drinking days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT heavy drinking days (>5 drinks) and reported less craving compared to the placebo treated patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the outcome variables at baseline or follow up measurements. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Compared with placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the SRP of NTX significantly reduced the frequency of heavy drinking days during the Injection and Follow-up Periods. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Interactions were observed between medication group assignment and both craving level prior to randomization (p = .02) and family loading of alcohol problems (p = .05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients treated with nalmefene also had fewer subsequent relapses (P<.03) than patients given placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The 40 mg group had a significantly lower rate of relapse (p < or = 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and a greater increase in the number of abstinent days/week (p < or = 0.09) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT than the other treatment groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The survival function showed that patients treated with aripiprazole remained abstinent from any alcohol amount for a longer time with respect to those treated with naltrexone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The combined medication was most effective with significantly lower relapse rates than placebo and acamprosate but not naltrexone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Medication interactions were found for cocaine use via urine drug screens (three way |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with time) and self-reports (two way) for drug severity (two way) and alcohol use (two way). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone seemed to reduce relapse rate to heavy drinking |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but we found no differences in other alcohol consumption variables between naltrexone- and placebo-treated groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT More patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Subjects taking naltrexone reported significantly less alcohol craving and days in which any alcohol was consumed. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Overall |PUNCHLINE_TEXT naltrexone showed only modest effects in reducing alcohol drinking for the 12 weeks of treatment. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The median reduction from baseline of serum GGT (P: < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (Obsessive and Compulsive Drinking Scale: OCDS) were greater in the naltrexone group (P: < 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT from approximately half-way through the study. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Rates of cocaine use and drinks per day did not differ between treatment groups; however naltrexone did reduce frequency of heavy drinking days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT as did CBT without CM. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The relapse rates between the two groups were not significant (p = 0.671). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic |PUNCHLINE_TEXT severe alcohol dependence. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The active medication group showed better medication compliance |PUNCHLINE_TEXT while the number of adverse events was low overall and not significantly different by group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intent-to-treat analyses suggested that there was no overall efficacy of naltrexone and no medication by psychosocial intervention interaction. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among those with eating disturbances |PUNCHLINE_TEXT symptoms of eating pathology improved during treatment |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the effects did not differ according to medication condition. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone was not better than placebo in the supportive groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but it had a significant effect in the coping groups: 27% of the coping/naltrexone patients had no relapses to heavy drinking throughout the 32 weeks |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with only 3% of the coping/placebo patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The overall results are encouraging; 42% of the subjects had a remission of their depression and had no drinking relapses during the trial. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone treatment response was significant within the group of 75 individuals who were homozygous for OPRM1 Asn40 allele. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Also |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there were no significant differences between the study groups concerning secondary effectiveness measures as well as compliance and adverse clinical events--with the exception of the gamma-GT |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which was significantly greater reduced in the naltrexone group throughout the study. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone was well tolerated and there were few adverse experiences. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The study completion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT therapy participation |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and medication compliance rates in the trial were high |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with no differences between treatment groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Naltrexone depot subjects also had significantly

old women. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Increases in muscle strength of the weight trainers were significant for all seven exercises (5%-65%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with the greatest gains in the shoulder and trunk muscles. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All exercise treatment groups revealed lower resting heart rate and rate-pressure product; lower exercise diastolic blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion; increased GXT duration; increased leg |PUNCHLINE_TEXT back |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and shoulder 5RM scores; and improved AAHPERD flexibility |PUNCHLINE_TEXT coordination |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and cardiovascular endurance scores. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Only the RT group exhibited change in structural properties: a rise in mitochondrial volume density (31%) and muscle size (10%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Neither group showed a change in peak aerobic capacity or in whole-body composition |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although fat-free mass of the leg increased in the exercise group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Muscle strength increased significantly in both the rhGH/exercise (+55.6% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P =.0004) as well as the exercise alone (+47.8% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P =.0005) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant strength improvements (P<0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ranging between 197 and 285% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT were recorded in the experimental group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The experimental group significantly increased in all strength measures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT while the control group increased in only right leg flexion and left leg extension across the training period. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both exercise groups showed significant improvements relative to control group in upper and lower body strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT shoulder flexibility |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and agility and balance exercise. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Resistance training led to improved measures for domains of upper body strength (+18 vs. +6%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT lower body strength (+23 vs. +6%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT endurance (+26 vs. +1%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT balance and coordination (+29 vs. -2%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 6-min walk

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT For each of the eight exercises |PUNCHLINE_TEXT muscle strength increased in the exercise groups relative to CO (P < .01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with no difference among EX1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT EX2 and EX3 groups at any measurement interval. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant interaction was observed between time and group and therefore no difference in strength changes between training once a week versus twice a week after 9 weeks. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Relative to controls |PUNCHLINE_TEXT subjects who participated in the program achieved statistically significant lower extremity strength improvements of 6% to 12% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a 20% improvement in tandem gait |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and a 15% to 18% reduction in physical and overall disability at the 6-month follow-up. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The hydrotherapy group increased left quadriceps strength only at follow up |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and this was significantly different from the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT MANOVA repeated measures revealed that the HI group demonstrated the most strength gains following a speed specificity pattern (most considerable improvement occurred at or near slow speeds from 7.3% to 11.2% for male and from 2.3% to 15.2% for female). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no effect of either intervention on physical health or falls |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but patients in the exercise group were at increased risk of musculoskeletal injury (risk ratio = 3.6 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% confidence interval = 1.5-8.0). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Statistical analyses (analysis of covariance) showed significant strength gains (p < 0.01) in bilateral bench press (> 29%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT bilateral leg press (> 19%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and unilateral biceps curl (> 20%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT RT induced a 37% reduction in shortening fluctuations at 5% of MVC and 35% reduction in lengthening fluctuations at both 30% and 65% of MVC. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Compared with ROM |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ST decreased the mean rate of joint space narrowing (JSN) in osteoarthritic knees by 26% (P = not significant). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a significant overall impact across the four measures of the exercise intervention (P = 0.013). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Training resulted in a significant increase in VO2max in the ET (+7.4% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.005) group only. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although LP and KE 1RM muscle strength increased similarly in both groups asa result of the training (P < .001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT LP peak power increased significantly more in HI than in LO (267 W vs 139 W |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < .001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Strength increased by 18% (P < 0.005) in five out of seven exercises in the training group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but was unchanged in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT High intensity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT home based strength training can produce substantial improvements in strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT pain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT physical function and quality of life in patients with knee OA. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Baseline cortisol concentration (P < 0.01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT CD20+ cell count (P < 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT CD3+ cell count (P < 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and CD4+ cell count (P < 0.01) decreased in both groups secondary to circannual variations between winter and

improvements in measures of disability |PUNCHLINE_TEXT physical performance |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and pain from participating in either an aerobic or a resistance exercise program. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Resistance training that consisted of two training sessions per week was found to be at least as efficient as resistance training that included three training sessions per week |PUNCHLINE_TEXT provided that the number of sets performed were equal. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Serum CRP levels were reduced in subjects undergoing resistance training (-1.7 mg/L) compared with controls (1.5 mg/L; P = 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Improvement in muscle strength was significantly greater with resistance training (32% +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Maximal strength was significantly greater for the ST group than for the C group (p =.015) after the intervention. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although low intensity training improved (p<0.05) strength (42-66%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT anaerobic power (10%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and mobility (5-7%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT high intensity training elicited greater (p<0.05) gains (63-91% in strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 17-25% in anaerobic power |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 9-14% in mobility). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ST and SA increased significantly (p < 0.05) sit-and-reach performance |PUNCHLINE_TEXT elbow flexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT knee flexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT shoulder flexion and extension and hip flexion and extension both at mid- and post-training. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Quality of life subscales of bodily pain (p = .001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT vitality (p = .002) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT social functioning (p = .008) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and role emotional (p = .02) were all significantly improved by exercise compared to controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Training did not induce changes in PBMC subsets |PUNCHLINE_TEXT interleukin (IL)-1 beta

in any of the training groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with control subjects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At 3 months |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no difference in mean change in HRQOL and physical activity scores was seen between the groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT except for an increased SF-36 physical functioning score for the resistance group compared with the control group (p = 0.019) and the function group (p = 0.046). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The impact of strength gain on chair rise performance was significant in participants who were more impaired (p = .04). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a group and time effect as the EX group increased 31.4% (p <.001) in strength for all muscle groups after the first 6 months of training |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the strength gains were retained for the duration of the training intervention. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Performance measurements included 1RM lower-body strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT chair-rising time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT walking velocity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT stair-climbing time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and flexibility. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT All three types of group-based exercise programs significantly reduced back pain and its related disabilities |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but only resistance and agility training significantly improved health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older women with low bone mass. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Muscle biopsies (n = 20) taken at the start and after the first 11 weeks of training showed a significant increase in the area of both type 1 and type 2 fibers in the biceps brachii muscle and a positive significant correlation between the percentage increase in the proportional area of type 2 fibers in the vastus lateralis muscle and the percentage increase in knee extension dynamic muscle strength. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (P= 0.029). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT VO2peak was increased after both RT and AT (P < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Between 7 and 18 months after randomization |PUNCHLINE_TEXT control subjects had more outpatient clinic visits (p < .06) and were more likely to sustain hospital costs over $5000 (p < .05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Single-repetition maximum strength significantly improved in the PRT group for LP (16.2%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT paretic KE (31.4%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and nonparetic KE (38.2%) with no change in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No changes were found in the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT except for decreased peak oxygen uptake (P<0.02) and quality of life scores (P<0.03). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The coefficient of variation (CV) for force during submaximal isometric contractions did not change with training for any group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Neither type of training reversed the depressions in resting metabolism or fat oxidation rates (ie |PUNCHLINE_TEXT resting or postprandial) that had occurred as a consequence of the prior weight loss. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Responses to a chronic respiratory questionnaire showed significant improvements in dyspnoea and mastery of daily living activities in the trained group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Muscle mass |PUNCHLINE_TEXT muscle strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and dynamic balance increased in the strength-trained women and decreased in the controls (P = .03 to < .001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Mean TUG results from the pre-test were significantly lower than mean results from post-test. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Upper and lower extremity strength were significantly higher after 12 weeks of ST or COMT with no change after AT or NT. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In RE the following improved (P < 0.05): |PUNCHLINE_TEXT RT was not associated with changes in LV cavity size |PUNCHLINE_TEXT wall thickness |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mass |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or systolic function after 4 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 8 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 12 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 16 weeks of exercise. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At six months there was a trend for the PRT intervention group to have lower GDS scores than the comparison group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but this finding did not reach significance (p = 0.08). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Exercise increased FSR of MHC by 47% (P < 0.01) and mixed muscle protein by 56% (P < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The effect of resistance training was significant (MANOVA F = 21.1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < 0.001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but balance training did not improve strength |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and there was no interaction (positive or negative) between balance and resistive training. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The 12-week resistance exercise intervention did not improve body composition as measured by changes in body weight |PUNCHLINE_TEXT body mass index |PUNCHLINE_TEXT waist circumference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or subcutaneous skinfolds. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Strength improved 22% in the power-trained individuals and 12% in the walkers (p <.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In comparison to control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT InVEST group manifested significant improvements (P<.05) in leg power across measurements obtained at 75% to 90% of the one-repetition maximum. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In single fibers |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no changes in size and contractility were noted after 2 weeks |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but specific force was higher in the training group after 12 weeks. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Bone mineral density (BMD) of the femoral neck significantly (P < 0.05) increased by 1.96% for the HEX group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Individual changes in KE torque/body mass before and after 18 weeks of training averaged 19.1% in the strength group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 30.9% in the endurance group and 2.0% in the controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Change in aggregate functional performance score (the sum of 4 functional performance test scores) did not differ between the four intervention groups nor with high-intensity PRMST compared with low-resistance exercise (7 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results showed a trend towards improvement in both the exercise groups in both Sit to Stand and Timed Get Up and Go tests |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but this failed to attain statistical significance. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT exercise time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or training effects were found for CD3+ |PUNCHLINE_TEXT CD3+CD4+ |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or CD3+CD8+ cells |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but there was a significant exercise time effect for CD3-CD16+CD56+ cells. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At posttest the exercisers demonstrated slower gait velocity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT enhanced balance |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and an improved ability to walk backward |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although none of these posttest measures was significantly different from the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Resistance training resulted in significant (P<0.05) increases in repetition maximums across all exercises (range 41-78%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Following the training |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the resistance group exhibited improved ankle dorsiflexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT training resistances |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and gait velocity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but showed no change in plantar flexion or postural control. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT KE strength and endurance |PUNCHLINE_TEXT stair-climbing power |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and chair-rising time improved significantly in the HI and LI groups compared with the PC group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the isometric group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT time to perform all 4 functional tasks decreased (P<.05) by 16% to 23%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Analysis of covariance indicated that all three exercise intervention groups significantly improved measures of functional ability |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with the resistance group demonstrating the most consistent gains over the six measures. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant increases were found in the Ex group for eccentric (44%) and concentric (60%) average power (p < 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and improvements were seen on each functional test: the 8-foot up-and-go |PUNCHLINE_TEXT chair stand |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and walk time improved by 31% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 66% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 33% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively (p < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The strength training program was very effective in improving strength in PF (+24.5%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and it thus reduced the DF-to-PF MVC torque ratio; in addition |PUNCHLINE_TEXT it also induced gains in DF (+7.6%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both treatment groups showed significant strength gains (p < .05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which occurred over a wider velocity spectrum for the exercise group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were significant increases in type I and type II fiber areas |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and capillary density also increased significantly in the training group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT By weeks 12 and 18 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT all training groups were significantly stronger than controls (p < 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both groups significantly improved their combined lower-extremity strength (hip abduction |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ankle dorsiflexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT knee flexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ankle plantarflexion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and knee extension) (P = 0.003) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but no statistical difference between the ST and FT group gains (P = 0.203) was found. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The combined strength and treadmill training program and treadmill training after 12 weeks of strength training resulted in increases in peak exercise performance similar to those observed with 12 weeks of treadmill training alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The cross-sectional areas of the knee extensors increased significantly by 5.5% in EX but were unchanged in CON. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Stair-climbing power also improved in the exercisers as compared with the nonexercisers (by 28.4 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Mean electromyogram signal amplitude of vastus lateralis was larger in the strength-training than in the standard-rehabilitation group at 5 and 12 wk (P < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT STREN improved significantly in chest press and leg extension strength (P less than or equal to 0.05) while W/J and CONT showed

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT (3) time to achieve active labor (18.3 vs 25.5 hours |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.019) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and (4) hospital stay (3.7 vs 4.4 days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.03). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences in relation to cesarean delivery rate |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Apgar scores at 5 minutes |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and arterial umbilical cord pH |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although the power of our study was limited to detect differences in proportions of adverse outcomes. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference between the two groups in the use of instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections nor was there any difference with regard to fetal distress. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significantly better results for both cervical priming and labor induction were obtained after intracervical PGE2-gel application than after treatment with placebo or vaginal suppositories. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intracervical administration of dinoprostone with prelabor rupture of membrane at term and unripened cervix shortens the interval to delivery without a significant increase of maternal or neonatal morbidity. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences in the number of

side effects did not occur in our group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and there is also no higher incidence of surgical deliveries. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Adverse perinatal outcome in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies of > or = 41 weeks is very low with either of the management schemes described. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The cesarean rate was also significantly lower in the PGE2 group (13.1 versus 31.6% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P =

were altered in all patients not proceeding to labor spontaneously |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the changes were most significant in the low- and high-dose groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between the groups except in the incidence of patients going into labor within 72 hours. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT As estimated by life table analysis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the pessaries were significantly more effective inducing vaginal delivery compared to intracervical gel (24 h: P less than 0.025 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 48 h: P less than 0.01 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT logrank test) and vaginal delivery was obtained within 24 h/48 h in 50%/72% of the women in the pessary group and in 29%/55% of the women in the intracervical group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Endocervical prostaglandin E2 had a more marked effect on cervical ripeness than did vaginal prostaglandin E2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but this did not result in any differences in more substantive outcomes. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In addition the induction-delivery interval was shortened (median times 9.0 h vs. 11.3 h) and fewer cesarean sections were performed (16% vs. 21%) in the PGE2 gel series. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results obtained showed a significant increase in Bishop's score 12 hours after cervical ripening |PUNCHLINE_TEXT irrespective of the way PGE2 was administered: from 2.3 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Contrary to current opinion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT intracervical dinoprostone gel does not appreciably lower the cesarean section rate when used at this dose and route before labor is induced. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The PGE2 pessary appears to be more effective with 68% of patients either going into labour during cervical ripening or succeeding in the cervical ripening compared to around 50% in the Atad and PGE2 gel groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Compared with intracervical therapy prostaglandin E2 given intravaginally was more likely to significantly change the Bishop score (60.4% vs 40.4% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.04) and

rapidly and to leave hospital earlier. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Of 25 patients catheterized for both group postoperative urinary retention occurred in 2 (8%) and required a new catheter. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in bacteriuria after 14 days (50.0 vs. 53.3%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The postoperative urinary tract infection rates of Groups A and B were 16.6% and 23.3% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively ( P>0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Asymptomatic bacteriuria at catheter removal was found in 21.0% of suprapubic and in 12.5% of transurethral catheter patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT In Study 1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT infection was significantly reduced with respect to all parameters in the group receiving two doses of cefotaxime |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and total drug treatment

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT urinary tract infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or need for recatheterization. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Bladder infusion before a ToV after TURP significantly increases the rate of readiness for

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 5 (11.1%) and 3 (6.5%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT received a new catheter. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant difference was noted in the incidence of UTI (5 vs. 10 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.25) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with a trend towards less UTI in group 1. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At follow-up after one year |PUNCHLINE_TEXT postoperative bacteriuria was closely correlated to increased rates of both clinical cystitis and asymptomatic significant bacteriuria. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no statistically significant differences in either the duration of continuous catheter drainage before the return of spontaneous voiding or the incidence of urinary tract infection in the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This trial determined that early catheter removal may be feasible and desirable in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients who had their catheters removed at midnight passed a greater volume of urine with both their first (268 ml compared with 177 ml; P<0.0001) and second voids (322 ml compared with 195 ml; P<0.0001) than their counterparts in the 0600 group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Catheter removal on day 1 led to a significantly shorter post-operative hospital stay (2.3 days versus 3.3 days) and did not incur a higher incidence of complications. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A randomized prospective study was set up to assess the role of postoperative catheter drainage and the value of hydraulic self-dilatation of the urethra after internal urethrotomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Urinary retention after 7 days was present in 23.99% with suprapubic vesical drainage and 28.5% with urethral catheter. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Residual volumes exceeding 200 mL and need for recatheterisation occurred in 9% in the standard prolonged

rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant difference was observed by 48 hours in those presenting with bloody diarrhea. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a significant (P < 0.05) difference in diarrhoea frequency on day 2 between probiotics (3.3 [loose stools]; 2.5-4.3) and placebo (4.7; 3.8-5.7) groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Even on Day 3 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ORS use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The percentage of CD8 lymphocytes on day 7 was significantly higher

Forty-eight hours after inclusion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT diarrhea was still present in 62% of group M versus in 35% of group Y (P < 0.002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A statistically significant difference was observed in the number of stools on the 4th and 7th day favouring the subgroup that received early treatment (within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The frequency and duration of diarrhea |PUNCHLINE_TEXT requirement for intravenous therapy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and hospital stay were significantly lower in both the intervention groups compared with the controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT When compared to the placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Bifilac showed clinical as well as statistically significant reduction in Number of episodes (frequency) of diarrhea in a day |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mean duration of diarrhea (in days) degree of dehydration |PUNCHLINE_TEXT duration and volume of oral rehydration salt [ORS] therapy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT duration and volume of intravenous fluid [IVF] therapy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT duration of rotaviral shedding (P<0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days (p=0.035) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT reduction in diarrhea frequency (p=0.049) and weight gain (p=0.017). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Stool-reducing substances (> 1%) were detected more frequently in the MF group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the differences were significant for day 3 of the study (p = 0.04). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Hospital stays were significantly shorter in group B than in group A. Administering oral rehydration solution containing Lactobacillus GG to children with acute diarrhea is safe and results in shorter duration of diarrhea |PUNCHLINE_TEXT less chance of a protracted course |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and faster discharge from the hospital. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Six days after the onset of diarrhea |PUNCHLINE_TEXT stools in only 4 out of 31 children that received Lactobacillus GG were positive for rotavirus compared with positive findings in 25 out of 30 control subjects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant differences were observed on days 14 (EcN 93.3% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT placebo 65.8% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.0017) and 21 (EcN 98.7% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT placebo 71.1% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Interferon- gamma and IL-12 were mildly elevated in the probiotics group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with the placebo group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant reduction in diarrhea duration and stool output in the group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT study group vs control group). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No intergroup differences were found in beta-glucuronidase |PUNCHLINE_TEXT beta-glucosidase |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and glycocholic acid hydrolase levels. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients with acute enteritis showed a significantly faster resolution of bowel abnormalities during treatment with Enterococcus SF68 compared with placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT S. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Administration of L. rhamnosus strains shortens the duration of rotaviral diarrhoea in children but not of diarrhoea of any aetiology. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference between the study group and control group in the frequency of diarrhea stools on the day before admission (p > 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Stool frequency was less on the second day in the lactobacillus group (P < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients receiving SF 68 had a reduced duration of diarrhea compared with placebo |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with a highly statistically significant difference between treatments. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT

respectively) were similar to those of cytology (0.83 and 0.82 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively) and PCR (0.77 and 0.95 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and higher than those of Southern blot hybridization (0.48 and 0.45 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The specificity of p16 cytology for HGCIN detection was significantly higher than for HPV testing for cytotechnologists and pathologists: 63.2% to 71.1% (p16 cytology) vs 37.8% for HPV in ASC-US (P < .001) and 37.3% to 53.3% (p16 cytology) vs 18.5% for HPV in LSIL (P < .001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Specificity was 44.9% in women

around 30%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The Abbott RealTime HR HPV showed similar clinical performance for detection of CIN2+ when compared with HC2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for both the overall population and those with a cytological grade of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASC-US). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The sensitivity of this test for high grade-SIL or higher was 90.2% and the negative predictive value was 96.5% (odds ratio=18.9; 95% confidence interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 10.9-33.1). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT They showed significant differences (P < 0.001) between negative p16 expressions of Pap smears with the presence of reactive lesions in follow-up biopsies and HR-HPV viral load. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT For women with ASCUS |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HPV testing was highly sensitive for detecting CIN3 and cancer with dramatically fewer referrals of older women. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In each group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the detection rate of grade 2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN 2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3) or cervical cancer in patients with positive HPV DNA was significantly higher than that with negative HPV DNA (P<0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Sensitivity to detect CIN3 or above by testing for cancer-associated HPV DNA was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 91.6% to 98.8%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The sensitivities of HC2 and

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT 6 (38%) of 16 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 14 (93%) of 15 cases |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HC II was also more often positive in women with negative colposcopic evaluations (29% [25.7-32.4%] vs. 20% [17.6-23.5%] |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < .005). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HPV infection was diagnosed in 11.2% of AFR and 38.0% of ASC-US (p=0.00003); high-risk HPV types (namely |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HPV-16 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -18 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -31 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -66 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -67 and -70) were found in 6.7% of AFR and 22.8% of ASC-US (p=0.00239). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The sensitivity of the second Pap smear and HPV-DNA test to detect CIN 2-3 was 61 (95% CI = 45-74) and 82% (95% CI = 67-91) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ProEx C staining is a more

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fifty percent of patients who received ranitidine alone for healing of duodenal or gastric ulcer had a relapse within 12 weeks of healing. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients with duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Histopathological results showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between eradicated and non eradicated patients in terms of severity of inflammation and intestinal metaplasia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but not in terms of atrophy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The ulcer healing rate was 90.2% (95% confidence interval (95% CI): 79-97%) in the omeprazole group at 6 weeks as compared to 83.3% (95% CI: 70-93%) in the triple

than did either treatment alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The relapse rate at the 3rd month was 11.7% (2/17) in the triple therapy group and 60% (6/10) in the omeprazole group (P = 0.0248). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Combined therapy with anti-H. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT H. pylori eradication occurred in 0% of the cimetidine group and in 73.7% of the double-therapy group (P = 0.004). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The prevalence of H. pylori was 82% and the eradication rate 88% in the OMC group and 3% in the OP group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The differences in the eradication and relapse rates between O vs. OMC and O vs. OAC were statistically significant (all |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Treatment with an antibiotic only

and 83.7% in Group C-LAC400 for duodenal ulcer. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No recurrence was noted in the duodenal ulcer patients and only 4% of gastric ulcers recurred after successful eradication during follow-up for 5 years. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The co-prescription regimens gave high H pylori eradication rates determined using two tests (CLOtest and 13C-urea breath test) for the presence of the organism. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The difference (higher relapse rate for omeprazole-treated patients) was significant (p < 0.001) by the second evaluation |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 4 months after treatment. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT HP eradication was achieved in 82% of the OME + AMX group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but in 0% of the OME group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Triple therapy eradicated H. pylori in 51 patients [intention-to-treat

33% and 0% at the third month |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 73% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 67% and 5% at the sixth month |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the overall failure rate (absence of healing |PUNCHLINE_TEXT relapse) was lower (P = 0.04 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Log-rank test) in the antibiotic group in which all relapses but one were observed in H. pylori positive patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The coprescription regimens gave significantly higher observed H. pylori eradication rates (82% and 74% for RBC400 + CLAR and RBC800 + CLAR) compared with RBC400 (0%; p < .001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The ulcer healing rate was 100% [95% confidence interval (CI) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95-100%] in H. pylori-negative and 83% (95% CI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 67-94%) in H. pylori-positive patients (P<0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Eleven patients in the triple therapy group suffered from adverse effects (45.8%) (p < 0.05 as compared with other groups). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The minimal inhibitory concentration of lansoprazole for H. pylori in vitro is lower than that for omeprazole |PUNCHLINE_TEXT prompting interest in treatment with amoxicillin plus lansoprazole. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Triple therapy had a similarly high healing rate to H2-blocker therapy (100% vs 90.5%) at two months of follow-up. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Rapid |PUNCHLINE_TEXT complete |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and persistent suppression of gastroduodenitis activity and gastric surface epithelium lesions was observed in most HP-eradicated group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT On an intention-to-treat basis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT omeprazole/amoxicillin led to

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT neither due to anaerobic bacteria |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but seven wound infections developed in patients given N-E (p = 0.057) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT five of them caused by anaerobic bacteria. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound infection rates |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which included minor and delayed infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT were similar in both groups (group P |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 57 of 342 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 16.7

of septic complications following colorectal surgery; nevertheless |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a study with a larger number of patients is needed to reach a definitive conclusion. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were found in the incidence of other major or minor infective or non-infective postoperative complications between the groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Because of an unacceptably high rate of surgical infection in all three groups (36% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 29% and 39% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT and total costs ($14.15) were not statistically different than that of the control drug. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Non-wound infectious morbidity was 5.8% (p greater than 0.05) for cefoperazone |PUNCHLINE_TEXT mostly urinary tract infections causes by Escherichia coli |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Streptococcus faecalis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and Staphylococcus spp. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Other infections were least frequent in group C (four of 29 patients) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but were not significantly different to groups B (six of 30) and A (nine of 31). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant intergroup difference was found between the respective overall rates of infectious complications (3.2% and 4.9%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group A and 9.1 percent in group B (difference not significant). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences in the infection rates between subgroups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound infection occurred in 1 case of group A versus 2 cases of group B (p greater than 0.25). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference between the groups in deep sepsis or anastomotic leak rates (sulbactam |PUNCHLINE_TEXT four patients; cefoxitin |PUNCHLINE_TEXT seven patients). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were two episodes of septicaemia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT each in the mezlocillin group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Co-amoxiclav was given to 230 patients with a total wound infection rate of 5.6% and cefuroxime plus metronidazole were given to 225 patients with a total wound infection rate of 3%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients who received tinidazole and doxycycline had significantly fewer infectious complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT reoperations |PUNCHLINE_TEXT additional use of antibiotics |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and a shorter hospital stay. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was a low incidence (1.3%) of serious postoperative bleeding and no serious adverse reactions were noted. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant difference in postoperative infections between the two groups could be demonstrated. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The proportion of patients with wound infections and other infective complications was significantly less (P < 0.02) in those receiving oral ciprofloxacin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time |PUNCHLINE_TEXT estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A subset analysis of prolonged operations found significantly fewer superficial SSIs in the single high dose group than in the multiple standard dose group with rates of 22.2% (6/27) vs. 55% (11/20) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively (P= 0.021). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative sepsis between the two groups (a total of 72 patients). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Episodes of sepsis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT urinary tract infection and pneumonia were similar in both groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Efficacy of prophylaxis in patients was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (abdominal |PUNCHLINE_TEXT urinary |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respiratory and wound infections). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Results in the two different groups were significantly different regarding abdominal abscess and the total infectious episodes in the surgical site with lower frequency in patients receiving both thymostimulin and the antibiotic (cefotetan). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ertapenem is more effective than cefotetan in the prevention of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery but may be associated with an increase in C. difficile infection. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (P = 0.003). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT When the four surgical blocks were separately considered |PUNCHLINE_TEXT however |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the difference between the two regimens was found to be mainly due to rectal operations |PUNCHLINE_TEXT following which the incidence of abdominal and of perineal wound infections was significantly lower with the combined regimen than with doxycycline alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (P = 0.03) and blood loss (P < 0.01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT while an MRSA infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (P < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (P = 0.07). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The data obtained demonstrated that the reduced infection rate was not the result of a reduction in the bacterial content of the colon alone but due to the prophylactic agents used for elective colon surgery. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Monitoring of operative and postoperative bleeding revealed no evidence (except in one doubtful case) of excessive bleeding associated with the use of a single dose of latamoxef. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Two of 27 patients receiving cefoxitin developed wound infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and one developed an intraabdominal abscess (11%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant difference was observed concerning local wound infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT septicemia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT anastomotic dehiscence or death. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The operative site infection rate was 6.5% for cefmetazole and 7.7% for cefoxitin (P greater than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both groups were comparable in sex |PUNCHLINE_TEXT age |PUNCHLINE_TEXT clinical diagnosis and type of operation performed. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In an open |PUNCHLINE_TEXT prospective |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and randomized investigation on the prophylactic efficacy of peroral neomycin sulfate-erythromycin base vs intravenous ceftriaxone-metronidazole preparation in colorectal surgery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significantly diverging results between regimens were recorded (1/27 [3.7%] and 2/27 [7.4%] wound infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The difference in infection rates (2/41 = 5% v. 7/33 = 21%) was statistically significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No differences were found in the two groups between frequencies of anastomotic dehiscences |PUNCHLINE_TEXT intra-abdominal abscesses |PUNCHLINE_TEXT sepsis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and pulmonary infections. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Deep wound infection or dehiscence was seen in 12 of 105 having both administrations of antibiotics |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and in nine of 98 having only intravenous antibiotics. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated preoperatively with salicylazosulfapyridine run a greater risk of postoperative infection in spite of the prophylaxis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The infection rate was 10% in the "one-dose" treatment group and 10% in the "four-dose" treatment group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group B patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures studied |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the overall abdominal infection rates (wound |PUNCHLINE_TEXT deep |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and septicaemia) being 4.6% and 7.4% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and the remote infection rates (pneumonia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT urinary tract |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and central venous line) 15.1% and 12.8% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 9% in Group A and 16% in Group B. Infections not of surgical origin were found only in Group B (10.4%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the postoperative course 53% (group A) and 67% (group B) of the patients developed bacterial infections. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Five out of 36 evaluable patients had an infection at the operation site. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (P less than 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group A) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group B or group C |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 3.1 in group A (1/32) and 0% in group B. Urinary tract infections (1 case) and respiratory tract infections (2 cases) were observed only in group B: |PUNCHLINE_TEXT When sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in contaminated operations. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The overall infection rate was 17 of 149 evaluable patients (11%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI 6.8 to 17.7. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The resulting difference between the overall septic complication rate in patients receiving erythromycin |PUNCHLINE_TEXT neomycin |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and cefazolin (10.9 percent) and the rate in patients receiving metronidazole alone (31.9 percent) was significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The prophylactic regimen significantly reduced the number of urinary tract infections (p less than or equal to 0.0001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients receiving cefoxitin had a higher wound infection rate than patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (12.5% v 3.2% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = .06). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In the cefotaxime group 22 of the 241 patients who had an anastomosis developed leaks (9%) compared with 8 of the 239 in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group (3%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound infection occurred in 15 patients (9.1%) and deep surgical infection in 4 (2.4%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The overall incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications was 7.3% (7 of 96) in the control group (no cefoxitin) and 5% (5 of 101) in the treatment group (cefoxitin). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intra-abdominal infections were more frequent in the clindamycin + gentamicin arm of the study (Fisher's exact test |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.035). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Analysis of the results showed that the two antibiotics had equivalent prophylactic effectiveness (congruent to 6%) in colorectal surgery. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The time of hospitalization was reduced from 20.3 days (CP) to 16.7 days (CO) (p less than 0.05 s). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The wound infection rate was 8% in those patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis and 20% in those receiving tinidazole (P less than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The wound infection rate was 2.4 percent in the patients receiving Timentin and 14 percent in those receiving tinidazole (P = 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No anaerobic pathogens were detected in any of the cases. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The wound infection rate was 10.6 percent in patients receiving Timentin and 9.7 percent in those receiving mezlocillin (P greater than .05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in wound infection rates between the two groups (14.7% for cefotetan and 13.9% for cefuroxime plus metronidazole) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or the rates of other infective complications. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The overall postoperative infection rate was 19.6% with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intra-abdominal abscess occurred in 8% of those who received amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with 6% of those given metronidazole plus gentamicin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The overall wound infection was 14.4% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with no difference between erythromycin and metronidazole. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The concentrations after administration of 2 g cefotiam were higher |PUNCHLINE_TEXT as expected |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and without any adverse side effects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Infection rates stratified by types of surgery were similar for both regimens. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The results show the effectiveness of the association gentamicin-metronidazole (9.4% of infections) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared to the control group with no antibiotics (39.1% of infections) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT X2 = 14.1; P less than 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT It is concluded that short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime is as effective as long-term prophylaxis with penicillin and streptomycin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The postoperative wound infection rate was significantly lower in Group I patients than Group II 5.6% (6/107) and 18.4% (21/ 114) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively (p < 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No statistically significant between-treatment difference was detected in successful clinical response rates at the end of the study (72% for each group). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT It is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference on the incidence of postoperative wound sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery between the group given doxycycline for five days and the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole for one day. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound infection occurred in five of 81 patients who had topical application of ampicillin compared with six of 89 patients who did not receive prophylaxis; the difference was not significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference in the other outcome measures studied which included non-fatal deep sepsis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT length of postoperative hospital stay |PUNCHLINE_TEXT duration of postoperative fever or the use of antibiotics for postoperative infection. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ie |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 4.9% to 8.9%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The rate of postoperative wound infections was not significantly different in the groups (p = 0 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 09). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no statistically significant difference between both chemoprophylaxis groups (p = 0.10). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No complications were observed from either the 10% mannitol solution or the intravenous Flagyl at either clinical |PUNCHLINE_TEXT hematologic |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or biochemical assessment. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal |PUNCHLINE_TEXT pelvic |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or wound infections. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound sepsis was demonstrated in 11.5% of cases of group A and 23.0% of group B (P less than 0.01);

difference in postoperative morbidity rate in the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In young women with right lower abdominal pain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT laparoscopy can give precise diagnosis and reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were five (9 per cent) wound infections after open appendicectomy compared with none after the laparoscopic operation (P < 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT LA is a more expensive alternative and offers no advantages related to pain relief |PUNCHLINE_TEXT length of stay |PUNCHLINE_TEXT return to normal activities |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or morbidity. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Unlike other minimally invasive procedures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT laparoscopic appendectomy did not offer a significant advantage over open appendectomy in all studied parameters except quality of life scores at 2 weeks. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in duration of sick leave after operation (laparoscopic group 11 days versus open group 14 days). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy is comparable to open appendectomy with regard to complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT hospital stay |PUNCHLINE_TEXT cost |PUNCHLINE_TEXT return to activity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and return to work. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopy was associated with fewer wound infections (P < 0.03) and improved cosmesis (P < 0.001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the operating time was longer (60 versus 40 min). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Postoperative pain was significantly less in the LA group on the 1st (p < 0.001) and 2nd (p < 0.001) postoperative day |PUNCHLINE_TEXT resulting in less use of analgesics on both days (p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No positive blood cultures were demonstrated in the open operated group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform without affecting significantly the needs for postoperative analgesia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the duration of hospital stay and the time to return to normal activities when compared with open appendectomy in men. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This occurred at an average of 25 days for the open appendectomy group versus 14 days for the laparoscopic appendectomy group (p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no complications of laparoscopy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy does not offer any proved benefits compared with the open approach for the routine patient with acute appendicitis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anesthetic time (72.5 minutes versus 55 minutes) and actual operating time (45 minutes versus 25 minutes) compared with open appendectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Excess operating and complication costs per procedure were 96 euros (EUR) in laparoscopic appendectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy has no advantages in terms of convalescence and time to return to work when compared to open appendectomy and should therefore be limited to selected cases. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the appearance of the appendix. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in postoperative pain or fatigue |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but return to normal life was faster in the LA group (14 versus 26. 5 days). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopy was associated with no added complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no increase in hospital stay in patients who went on to appendicectomy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and a reduction in hospital stay for those who underwent laparoscopy alone. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The outcome following laparoscopic appendicectomy for confirmed acute appendicitis is at least equivalent to that achieved with conventional appendicectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT We found that LA is associated with a shorter hospital stay |PUNCHLINE_TEXT fewer postoperative complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and better diagnostic accuracy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and it is recommended as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The laparoscopic group had a significant reduced postoperative narcotic requirement (P<0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT quicker reintroduction of diet and quicker return to normal activity. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Wound infections were more common following OA (n = 11) than LAL (n = 4) or LAS (n = 0) (P < 0.05 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The complication rate after open appendectomy (25.8%) was not significantly different from that after laparoscopic appendectomy (12.1%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no statistically significant differences between the LA and OA groups in operative risk: mean age |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 28 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no differences in hospital stay or the postoperative course of the patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The operative time in LA group was significantly (p < 0.001) longer (87.2 minutes) than for OA group (65.2 minutes). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Despite an increasing metabolic acidosis |PUNCHLINE_TEXT prolonged carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum resulted in only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentrations |PUNCHLINE_TEXT which was both statistically and clinically insignificant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT When compared to open appendectomy the laparoscopic group had a longer median operating time (63 minutes versus 40 minutes) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT fewer wound infections (2% versus 11%) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT less requirement for narcotic analgesia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and an earlier return to normal activity (median 7 days versus 14 days). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The OA group rendered a greater wound-complication rate and ileus than did the other two groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the differences were not detected between the three categories ( P = 0.065 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.6935). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The risk of unnecessary appendicectomy was significantly (P = 0.03) lower after laparoscopy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Length of stay averaged 21.5 h for the laparoscopic group and was not statistically different when compared to the open group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference between groups for demographic data

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT postoperative pain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or operative time with laparoscopic appendectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Average postoperative length of stay without any complications was 6.2 +/-2.5 days in the open group and 4.3 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The relative risk of removing a healthy appendix in open surgery was 6.6 relative risk (range |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2-21 C.I.) as compared with laparoscopy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The operating time seemed to be shorter for the OA patients than for the LA patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but the difference was not significant (LA |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 30 +/- |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform than open appendectomy (median |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 107 vs 91 minutes; P <.01) and was associated with fewer days to return to a general diet (mean |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.6 versus 2.3 days; P <.01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT a shorter duration of parenteral analgesia (mean |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.6 versus 2.2 days; P <.01) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT fewer morphine-equivalent

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT and earlier return to full activity (median |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 14 versus 21 days; P <.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anaesthetic time (78 minutes versus 51) and operating time (49 minutes versus 23) compared with open appendectomy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Laparoscopic appendicectomy has higher direct costs than open operation and is not as cost-effective when the longterm outcome is the same in both groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The mean hospital stay for LA was 3.23 days compared with 3.03 days for OA (p < 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Functional status was significantly better in the LA group 7-10 days after operation (P = 0.045). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Though laparoscopic appendectomy started endoscopic surgery in general surgery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT it

gram-positive (Gram+) infections and infections with gram-negative (Gram-) organisms usually resistant to pefloxacin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Four significant differences were observed between the group given

3) 23 patients on prophylaxis presented at least one febrile episode versus 33 in the control group (p less than 0.01); 4) deaths due to infection were two in the TMP/STX group versus 11 in control group (p less than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients with initial leukopenia of grade WHO III-I had only a 11% infection rate showing no significant difference between the treatment groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients receiving ciprofloxacin also had fewer days of fever (average 6.5 days versus 9.8 days for the polymyxin B group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p less than 0.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Among patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the prophylactic use of levofloxacin reduces the incidence of fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT probable infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT No side effects that related to ofloxacin were noted. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no significant difference in the occurrence of febrile days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT febrile episodes |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the duration of antibiotic treatment |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the number of sepsis in two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin reduced the

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT or all-cause mortality. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both treatment groups acquired yeasts. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT C + R combination prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of gram-positive bacteremia (five versus zero episodes) but was associated with a higher incidence of drug-related side effects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (P less than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ciprofloxacin was therefore superior to the other two fluoroquinolones in preventing infections due to Gram-negative bacteria in this population of neutropenic patients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones reduced the occurrence of infection in adult neutropenic patients without affecting the long-term survival. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Only one infection caused by Gram-negative bacilli was observed in the pefloxacin group compared with seven in the norfloxacin group (p = 0.019). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were

range 10-49). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although there was a trend toward a reduction in the overall incidence of bacteremia (12 v 4 patients) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and Gram-positive bacteremia (8 v 2 patients) with the addition of rifampin |PUNCHLINE_TEXT none of these comparisons was statistically significant (P =.05 and P =.09 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in fewer microbiologically documented infections (seven versus 15; p = 0.029). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Patients in group A had significantly more episodes of afebrile aplasia (34.5% vs 4%) and less bacteriemias (10% vs 48%) than those in group B. Also fever developed later in group A (mean: 12.5 vs 6 days). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms with respect to the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes as defined for this trial (79% for the norfloxacin group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 82% for the ofloxacin group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and 77% for the ofloxacin plus rifampin group). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 20% of the treated subjects versus 68.6% of the controls presented a subsequent infection (P less than 0.001) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the lung representing the most frequent site of the infectious disease in both groups (3/6 and 14/24 respectively). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Adverse events possibly related to the study drugs were slightly more common among the patients receiving the combination treatment (P = 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Acquisition of gram-negative bacilli was more frequent among patients treated with nalidixic acid plus nystatin while filamentous fungi were acquired more frequently by patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin (P = 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Gram-positive and gram-negative infections were significantly less frequent in patients receiving PV |PUNCHLINE_TEXT because of fewer infections with Staphylococcus species and enterobacteriaceae. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Although there was no difference between the two arms in the proportion of patients developing fever or in the median number of days of fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the time to onset of fever was a mean of 1 day longer in each patient on the pre-emptive arm (log rank P<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Levofloxacin reduced the bacterial infections and delays the onset of fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia especially in short duration (< 7 days). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The compliance was better in Group I but the treatment had to be modified in 9 patients of Group I because of liver abnormalities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no statistical difference in the occurrence of documented septicemia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT documented coccus Gram-positive infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or fever of unknown origins during aplasia in the 2 groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidence of febrile days and of days on parenteral antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in the group given TMP-SMZ and colistin (p less than 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidences of superficial skin and overall infections were significantly lower in those patients with multiple relapses who received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.008); however |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no difference between the groups in regard to days of fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT days of antibiotic administration |PUNCHLINE_TEXT days of hospitalization |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or gram-negative rod bacteremia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No differences were noted between the two groups with respect to secondary outcome measures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT including time to endpoint |PUNCHLINE_TEXT occurrence of fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT type and number of microbiologically documented infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and administration of intravenous antibiotics. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both drugs showed an effective elimination of gram-negative potential pathogens and Staphylococcus aureus not affecting the anaerobic flora of the gastrointestinal tract. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Norfloxacin was more effective than cotrimoxazole for preventing acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in surveillance cultures. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT With regard to the side effects |PUNCHLINE_TEXT there was no significant difference in the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidence of infection was higher in the trimethoprim group (50 percent) than in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (39 percent) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but this did not reach statistical significance. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (P less than .002). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Gram-positive cocci were isolated less frequently from TMP-SMZ-treated |PUNCHLINE_TEXT bacteremic patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but more of their isolates were resistant to TMP-SMZ than were those from placebo recipients. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were significantly fewer overall infections (10 versus 3; P = 0.016) and streptococcal infections (9 versus 1; P = 0.0078) in the group receiving gram-positive prophylaxis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Furthermore |PUNCHLINE_TEXT side effects were fewer and compliance was better with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There was no difference in the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease or incidence and duration of fever. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Group D Streptococcus species were poorly suppressed by GN compared with GVN |PUNCHLINE_TEXT although no patient developed an infection with these organisms. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prophylaxis was continued until the neutropenia resolved (granulocytes greater than 0.5.10(9)/l) or until the onset of infectious symptoms. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ciprofloxacin recipients required fewer days of therapeutic antimicrobials (median: 28 antibiotic-days vs. 49 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P0.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated way of preventing febrile episodes and other relevant infection-related outcomes in patients with cancer and profound and protracted neutropenia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fever or infection (without fever) developed in 190 (71%) of 268 evaluable patients in the penicillin arm compared with 213 (80%) of 268 evaluable patients in the placebo arm (P = .03; 95% confidence interval [CI] for the difference |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -16% to -1%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT TMS prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of C difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli |PUNCHLINE_TEXT as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In conclusion |PUNCHLINE_TEXT no significant difference was observed between the two groups in prevention of gram-positive bacteremias. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be easily taken |PUNCHLINE_TEXT to suppress the Enterobacteriaceae |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and to maintain the anaerobic rectal flora for biological stability of the rectal ecosystem. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were seen in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and ketoconazole substantially reduced the overall incidence of infection consequent to a marked decrease in bacterial infection. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ofloxacin was significantly better tolerated than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and shortened the duration of fever (p = 0.02) and of parenteral antimicrobial therapy for presumed or documented acquired infection (p = 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no differences in the incidence of Gram-positive infections nor in the length of hospitalization between the two treatment arms. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Only two Gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in the CIP + COL arm compared with 16 in the NEO + COL arm. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The addition of vancomycin resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of patients with surveillance cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (stool cultures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 44 versus 23%; throat swab cultures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 37 versus 19%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (throat swab cultures |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 90 versus 60%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both aerobic gram-negative rods and streptococci which caused infection despite cotrimoxazole prophylaxis were resistant to cotrimoxazole. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fifteen patients in the control group developed febrile neutropenia versus 12 of those in the ciprofloxacin group (P = 0.69). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This new combination antimicrobial regimen is safe and effective for prevention of gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia being treated with cytotoxic remission-induction chemotherapy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Duration of more than a 39 degrees C fever was much longer in the nystatin group than in the norfloxacin group: Bacteremia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT microbiologically documented infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and fever of unknown origin were more frequently seen in the nystatin group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but there was no significant difference between the two groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not significantly reduce the incidence of fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT hospitalization |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or infection in granulocytopenic patients during consolidation chemotherapy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Children receiving TMP-SMX had fewer episodes of bacteremia (0 vs. 5) and otitis media (3 vs. 18). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Infections due to gram negative bacteria decreased to 33.3% in the AP group (vs. 92% in the control group) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT but infections due to gram positive bacteria increased to 66.7% (vs. 8% in the control group). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A decrease in the total number of acquired infections was found (16 infections in the group given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus 31 in the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p less than 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The use of therapeutic antibiotics was reduced (P = 0.013; 1-sided) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT with less hospitalizations due to FL (31 vs. 17 patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.013: 1-sided). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Eleven of 16 microbiologically documented infections in the TMP/SMX group and 7 of 11 in the NOR group were caused by gram negative bacilli (GNB). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Norfloxacin was better tolerated (30 of 36 versus 16 of 30 patients highly compliant |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.02) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (eight of 36 versus 14 of 36 patients |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.07). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the time before the onset of the first fever |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the number of episodes of fever or of septicaemia per patient |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the number of neutropenic days during which patients remained afebrile or did not require systemic antibiotics |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or the number of resistant organisms acquired. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences in survival |PUNCHLINE_TEXT frequency of bacteremia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT overall infections |PUNCHLINE_TEXT use of systemic antimicrobial therapy |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or adverse effects |PUNCHLINE_TEXT including myelosuppression |PUNCHLINE_TEXT were observed between patients receiving TMP-SMZ vs. those receiving placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A decrease in the number of major acquired infections was observed: three infections occurred in 16 patients receiving the SAM regimen compared with eight infections in 17 patients given the placebo. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The death rate from infection was significantly reduced in patients who received antibiotics for gut flora suppression in conventional ward isolation compared with the corresponding control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Three significant differences were observed between the co-trmoxazole and the control groups: (i) 15 of the 16 (94%) control patients but only 8 of the 14 (57%) patients on co-trimoxazole developed infections and required additional antibiotics intravenously; (ii) although the duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.1 times 10(9)/1) was similar in the two groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT control patients required intravenous antibiotics on average after 2 days of neutropenia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT whereas patients receiving co-trimoxazole required these only after 12 days; and (iii) the only 2 patients who died of infection were in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This benefit was also associated with a 30% increase in the probability of failure-free survival at Day 15 (P = 0.138). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (P less than 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Adverse reactions associated with co-trimoxazole/colistin required discontinuation of medication in 11/27 treatment courses because of compliance problems |PUNCHLINE_TEXT skin reactions or gastrointestinal intolerance. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT ST + CPFX was significantly effective than ST alone (p < 0.005). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Incidence of infection at less than 100 granulocytes/microliters was significantly reduced in the TMP/SMZ group (2 infections/100 days) compared to placebo (11 infections/100 days |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.005). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The incidence of fever was not significantly different between episodes treated with TMZ-E (18/27) and those treated with P (17/29) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT nor was there a significant difference in the median interval between the onset of neutropenia and the onset of fever. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Clinically |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the prophylactic efficacy was 92% for the OFLX regimen and 40% for the control regimen (p less than 0.01). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The LAF plus A patients had a significantly decreased incidence of total infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT bacteremias |PUNCHLINE_TEXT pneumonias |PUNCHLINE_TEXT rectal abscesses |PUNCHLINE_TEXT urinary tract infection |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and pharyngitis. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Bacteraemia due to resistant gram-negative rods occurred only in the co-trimoxazole-colistin group though both regimens were effective for selective gastrointestinal tract decontamination. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT

overweight children (increase by 3.6 vs 0.4% per year without and with intervention |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively; P<0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Compared with controls |PUNCHLINE_TEXT participants in the intervention groups achieved their nutritional targets for fat intake and to a smaller extent for sugar and complex carbohydrate intake |PUNCHLINE_TEXT leading to a decrease in energy intake (children |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P < .001; parents |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = .02). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Total energy intake (by 24-h dietary recall) was significantly reduced in the intervention schools but energy intake (by

schools that had <75 min of Physical Activity Across the Curriculum |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Children playing Kalèdo showed a significant increase in nutrition knowledge (p<0.05) and in weekly vegetable intake (p<0.01) with respect to the control. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT This study population stabilized their BMI SDS (p < 0.025). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Parents in the increased fruit and vegetable group showed significantly greater decreases in percentage of overweight than parents in the decreased high-fat/high-sugar group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In addition |PUNCHLINE_TEXT girls in the active intervention groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages by 34% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT increased their level of moderate-to-vigorous activity by 12% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and increased their serving; of water by 1.5%. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In a 2-y intervention targeting increased physical activity and healthy eating in primary school children |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the adjusted body mass index (BMI) z score was 0.26 units (95% CI: 0.21 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.32) lower in intervention than in control children. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant improvements in nutrition knowledge were seen in all children (p<0.01) between baseline and post-intervention |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and results were highly significant in the nutrition and combined group (p<0.001). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Scores on the restriction subscale of the Child Feeding Questionnaire decreased significantly in the OPPS condition (-0.22+/- 0.42 vs. 0.08+/- 0.63 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p < 0.05) |PUNCHLINE_TEXT indicating that mothers in the OPPS group were engaging in less restrictive child feeding practices over time. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Parental involvement did not increase intervention effects. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Cross-sectional comparisons at baseline indicated lower physical activity |PUNCHLINE_TEXT self-efficacy for physical activity and aerobic fitness and a higher BMI in children with high screen time. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No differences in self-reported PA emerged between the intervention and control groups at Weeks 1 (baseline) and 12 (postintervention). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for the majority of outcome variables |PUNCHLINE_TEXT differences between intervention and control schools at postintervention and follow-up were not statistically significant. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No significant differences between groups were found for BMI. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Consumption of SSBs decreased by 82% in the intervention group and did not change in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Girls in the exercise group had a lower likelihood of having an increasing BMI slope than the control girls did (odds ratio: 0.32; 95% CI: 0.18 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.56). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Girls in control schools had significant increases in percentage of risk of overweight or overweight from third (26%) to fifth (39%) grades |PUNCHLINE_TEXT as did girls in CATCH schools (30%-32%); however |PUNCHLINE_TEXT the rate of increase for girls in the CATCH schools was

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.47; 95% confidence interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.19-1.75]). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Eating habits at home were found to be healthier among families with children in intervention schools at the end of the intervention. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Multilevel analyses showed that the intervention remained effective in preventing unfavorable increases in important measures of body composition after 20-month follow-up in girls (biceps skinfold and sum of 4 skinfolds) and boys (triceps |PUNCHLINE_TEXT biceps |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and subscapular skinfolds). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Following the Program Champion-directed intervention |PUNCHLINE_TEXT girls in intervention schools were more physically active than girls in control schools (mean difference 10.9 MET-weighted minutes of MVPA |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI=0.52-21.2). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The group by time interactions were significant for fitness (p < 0.01) and %BF (p < 0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Building community capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity appears to be a safe and effective way to reduce unhealthy weight gain in children without increasing health inequalities. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The percentage of children watching television/videos more than 2 h/d also decreased significantly from 33% to 18% among the intervention group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with an increase of 41% to 47% among the control group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT for a difference of -21.5% (95% confidence interval |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -42.5% to -0.5%; P =.046). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Intervention students had a lower increase in BMI (P=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted BMI (P<0.02) over time than controls. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Group allocation had no significant effect on the primary outcome measure at six and 12 months or on measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour by accelerometry. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At follow-up |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 45% of girls in the intervention schools and 36% of girls in the control schools reported vigorous physical activity during an average of 1 or more 30-minute time blocks per day over a 3-day period. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The intervention had positive |PUNCHLINE_TEXT significant effects on percentage BMI-for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight |PUNCHLINE_TEXT BMI |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and percentage body fat for parents. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT At follow-up |PUNCHLINE_TEXT compared with boys in the active comparison group |PUNCHLINE_TEXT boys in the intervention group displayed a smaller increase in BMI (adjust diff.=-0.2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.78 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.39; Cohen's d=0.05); greater reductions in waist circumference (-1.65 cm [-4.67 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.36]; d=0.15); percentage body fat (-1.69% [-4.98 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.60]; d=0.22) and time spent in small screen recreation on weekends (-1.13 h [-5.06 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 2.80]; d=0.19); and a greater increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (2.13 laps [6.22 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 10.48]; d=0.16); and participation in total weekday physical activity (140.74 counts/min [-159.44 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 440.92]; d=0.36). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Children from intervention schools spent less time on screen-viewing activities after the intervention but these differences were imprecisely estimated: mean difference in minutes spent on screen viewing at the end of the intervention (intervention schools minus control schools) adjusted for baseline levels and clustering within schools was -11.6 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The treatment group reported significantly reduced household television viewing (d = .73 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = .007) and fewer dinners eaten while watching TV (adjusted difference = -1.60 meals/week |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI -2.99 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT -.21; d = .59; P = .03). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT In contrast |PUNCHLINE_TEXT in boys only BMI z-score (p < 0.001) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001) were affected. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Each field center developed its own intervention(s) and corresponding control

|PUNCHLINE_TEXT Proximal migration and glenoid erosion did not correlate with shoulder function or pain. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were satisfactory improvements in the mean range of active elevation (53 degrees to 75 degrees) and external rotation (5 degrees to 38 degrees); satisfactory performance of the activities of daily living had been maintained throughout follow-up. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Satisfactory pain relief was achieved in 44 (66%) and 52 of the shoulders (78%) were described by patients as being much better or better. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Final clinical scores (Hospital for Special

maternal dietary carbohydrate may prove to be a valuable tool in the management of pregnancies at risk for anomalous feto-placental growth and for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and insulin resistance in the non-pregnant state. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT average gestational weight gain was 14.02 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 15.27 and 16.22 kg in the three EP |PUNCHLINE_TEXT EPP and comparison groups respectively |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and average weight retention at six months post partum was 2.34 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 4.06 and 5.08 kg in the three groups |PUNCHLINE_TEXT respectively. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes (6 versus 29% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT OR 0.17 95% CI 0.03-0.95 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P = 0.04). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Significant differences (P = .03) were found between study groups in the percentage of women who perceived their health status as "very good"; the values that corresponded to the exercise group (n = 18; 54.5%) were better than those of the control group (n = 9; 27.3%). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT No statistically significant differences were noted between the groups in adherence to IOM guidelines |PUNCHLINE_TEXT rate of cesarean delivery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT preeclampsia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT GDM |PUNCHLINE_TEXT operative vaginal delivery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT or vaginal lacerations. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The intervention significantly decreased the percentage of normal-weight women who exceeded the IOM recommendations (33 vs 58% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT P<0.05). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The offspring of the women who were randomly assigned to a high volume of exercise in mid and late pregnancy were significantly lighter (3.39 kg vs 3.81 kg) and thinner (8.3% fat vs 12.1% fat) than those offspring born of women who were randomly assigned to reduce their exercise volume after the 20th week. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A low-intensity behavioral intervention during pregnancy reduced excessive gestational weight gains in NW women and prevented postpartum weight retention in NW and OW/OB women. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT dietary counseling was effective in decreasing the weight gain of pregnant women who were overweight and reducing clinical complications |PUNCHLINE_TEXT such as gestational diabetes |PUNCHLINE_TEXT preeclampsia |PUNCHLINE_TEXT infant low weight |PUNCHLINE_TEXT and prematurity in the Intervention Group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT However |PUNCHLINE_TEXT insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) did not differ between the groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Nutrition knowledge improved significantly over time in both groups but more so in the Video Doctor group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT There were no significant differences in birth weight z score or other measures of infant adiposity between groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fat intake |PUNCHLINE_TEXT specifically saturated fat intake |PUNCHLINE_TEXT decreased and protein intake increased from the first to the third trimester in the passive and active groups compared with an opposite change in the control group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Fat content and daily caloric content of participants in the control group were significantly higher than the experimental group. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT The values of the OGTT during the second trimester did not differ between the lifestyle intervention and close follow-up groups. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT A low-glycemic index diet is effective as a treatment for individuals with diabetes and has been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes when used from the first trimester. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Omnibus MANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the study and control groups regarding 3 variables: (1) gestational hypertension |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p < .46; (2) mother's last weight before delivery |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p < .001; and (3) mother's 6-week postpartum weight |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p < .001. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Energy restriction did not alter the frequency of insulin therapy (17.5% in the intervention group and 16.9% in the control group). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Better glucose tolerance in the diet/probiotics group was confirmed by a reduced risk of elevated glucose concentration compared with the control/placebo group (OR 0.31 (95 % CI 0.12 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.78); P = 0.013) as well as by the lowest insulin concentration (adjusted means 7.55 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 9.32 and 9.27 mU/l; P = 0.032) and homeostasis model assessment (adjusted means 1.49 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 1.90 and 1.88; P = 0.028) and the highest quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (adjusted means 0.37 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 0.35 and 0.35; P = 0.028) during the last trimester of pregnancy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Regular weight measurement in pregnancy was not found to be effective in reducing weight gain |PUNCHLINE_TEXT except among women who were overweight but not obese before pregnancy. |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Neonatal birthweight was lower in the intervention than in the usual care group (absolute effect size -133 g |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% CI -231 to -35 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.008) as was proportion of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns (26/216 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 12.1% versus 34/179 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 19.7% |PUNCHLINE_TEXT p = 0.042). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Women in the exercise group were approximately 5 times more likely than those in the control group to have regular or good cardiorespiratory capacity (12/38 versus 2/38; relative risk 5.2 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 22.0 |PUNCHLINE_TEXT number needed to treat 5). |PUNCHLINE_TEXT Both s-insulin and s-leptin were reduced by 20% in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 27
