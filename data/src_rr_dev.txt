clinical information for people with epilepsy, is felt to be useful by GPs, and is completed more often than a patient-held card. |  The introduction of a nurse specialist in epilepsy is associated with a significant increase in patient reports that enough advice has been provided. |  Community health worker education led to a 74% increase in patient recruitment as well as a marked improvement in patient drug compliance over the 6-month study period. |  Participants of the MOSES program also improved in seizure outcome (p = 0.041) and became more satisfied with the therapy [better tolerability of antiepileptic drug (AED) therapy, fewer side effects; p = 0.014]. |  None of the intervention strategies led to improvements in patient quality of life or quality of epilepsy care. |  QOL was significantly improved from inclusion to completion of study in the intervention group (P=0.019), mainly in the subitems for Health Discouragement (P=0.01), Medication Effects (P=0.035), and

domain scores improved from baseline to Week 12 in the Exercise group (P = 0.031), while the Control group score did not change (P = 0.943). |  For this intervention group compared with the usual care group there was a highly significant improvement in the level of advice recorded as having been given on drug compliance, adverse drug effects, driving, alcohol intake, and self help groups. |  Mean change in Quality of Life in Epilepsy Inventory (QOLIE)-89 total scores was not different between groups, but for the entire sample QOLIE-89 change was greater for patients having a 15-point improvement in AEP scores than for those with a 0- to 15-point improvement or a worsened score (24 vs 12 vs 3; analysis of variance, p < 0.008). |  Users of the new service were significantly more

AOR = 2.10 for 3+ visits) or HIV clinical trials site care (AOR = 1.43; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01, 2.04). |  We found that for federal health programme clients in need of ancillary services, a positive relationship existed between their receipt of ancillary services and their access to primary medical care (p </= 0.001). |  The adjusted odds of being prescribed antiretroviral therapy increased 21% per month in period 2 and decreased to 3% per month in period 3. |  The average length of a hospital inpatient stay was halved for those patients who had participated in the project for two years, and the average number of visits to the outpatient clinic per month fell for patients with AIDS. |  Hospital admissions were fewer (AIDS patients, RR = 0.67; HIV-positive patients without AIDS, RR = 0.45), and length of stay was briefer, compared with patients at the other Kaiser Permanente Medical Centers. |  Among VA patients, black and Hispanic patients were not significantly different from white patients with regard to in-hospital mortality rates, use and timing of a bronchoscopy, or receipt of timely anti-PCP medications. |  Persons on prophylaxis had 20% lower adjusted odds of developing PCP (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64, 0.99). |  The Prenatal Care Assistance Program appeared to be successful in reducing the incidence of low birth weight and preterm delivery in this high-risk population. |  The study's principal finding was that specific ancillary services were significantly associated with an increase in an individual's likelihood of entering medical care and maintaining appropriate medical care services for HIV, particularly when the services addressed a corresponding need. |  At baseline GMC patients were more likely to be African American (85% vs 71%;

with pre-existing intention to cut down or quit smoking. |  Health Risk Appraisal, when accompanied by feedback counseling, was an effective health promotion tool to help prevent nonsmokers from acquiring the habit and to modify cigarette smoking behavior among college freshmen. |  During treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. |  Seventeen percent of the smokers enrolled in the clinics had reports of having quit smoking for at least the last 30 days at 3-month follow-up (5 months after the program quit day), compared to only 8% of the control condition smokers over than same time period. |  Among teenagers who were available at follow-up, a medium effect size (Cohen's h = .38) was found for reduction and a large effect size (Cohen's h = .69) was found for percentage reduction, although these results also were not statistically significant. |  A greater proportion of participants in the treatment condition (n = 26) reported cessation attempts and point abstinence than did control participants (n = 28) at all time points. |  Abstinence rates after 2 years were significantly higher for the tobacco intervention arm, relative to the control group, in the combined sample of baseline smokers and nonsmokers (odds ratio [ |  Mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean:

were not maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up. |  Further, nicotine dependence was positively correlated with duration of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked daily (P<.05). |  Sustained abstinence, reflecting 7-day abstinence at both time points, in the self-help and counseling arms was 7% and 9% (p = .59). |  Those who participated in the program were significantly more likely than controls to report at the immediate post-intervention assessment that they had abstained from smoking during the past week (p<or=.01), smoked fewer days in the past week (p<or=.001), smoked fewer cigarettes in the past week (p<or=.01), and considered themselves a former smoke (p<or=.05). |  There was also generally strong evidence of intervention impact for 3-month, 1-month, and 7-day abstinence and duration since last cigarette (P = .09, .015, .01, and .03, respectively). |  Among participants who continued to smoke, SOS was associated with a significantly greater reduction in average number of days smoked than BOI (P=0.006). |  NOT smoking cessation and reduction outcomes were significantly better than those of the brief intervention. |  Despite the lack of a treatment effect, a large majority of adolescents in both treatment groups reduced their consumption to a few cigarettes per day or less and maintained this reduction over time. |  At 3-month follow-up, only those in MI showed cotinine levels that were significantly reduced compared to baseline. |  Although treated participants improved more in tobacco related knowledge relative to controls (p = 0.002), there were no group differences in changes in attitudes toward smoking. |

(P less than 0.001) than did patients treated with the expectorant product. |  A single dose of the combination was superior to paracetamol and placebo for NAC (p = 0.0001) and was superior to pseudoephedrine and placebo for pain relief (p < or = 0.048). |  The lower dose did not reveal significant different results compared with placebo for relief of nasal congestion in patients with a

significantly higher in the group treated with ebastine plus pseudoephedrine (75.8%) than in the group treated with placebo (57.6%; p<0.001). |  Treatment reduced the severity of rhinorrhea, sneezing, nasal obstruction, sore throat, cough, and headache and reduced nasal mucus production, nasal tissue use, and virus concentrations in nasal secretions. |  The decongestive effect of Rhinopront syrup was assessed in 18 adults and 18 children with acute rhinitis, by comparison to a matching placebo syrup and to a commercial standard decongestant (Triaminic tablets or drops). |

P < .05). |  For boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys. |  Among time 1 ever smokers, both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78, 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18, 2.23), respectively], and the two estimates were not significantly different. |  The most important predictor of smoking for boys, having a best friend who smoked, was significant on application of the chi 2 test (P 0.037), although it was non-significant when included singly in a logistic regression model (0.094); the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke. |  Two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the California Tobacco Surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later. |  The more advertisements identified at baseline, the greater was the risk of being a smoker (p<0.0001). |  In girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% CL, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% CL, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years. |  Cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour, beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable. |  For each 1-SD increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. |  The older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category, with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge. |  Among non-smokers, the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke, the belief that smoking is fun, peers, siblings and mother consumption, and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers. |  Among the cohort, baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, P = 0.0001), brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86, P = 0.0004), and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87, P = 0.0002). |  Adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither. |  No significant interaction effects between pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on smoking susceptibility were found. |  Less than 5% (n=92) at baseline possessed a promotional item but a further 10%(n=172) were willing to use an item. |  Exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for White (susceptibility and ever smoking) and African American (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for Hispanic adolescents. |  Adjusting for multiple risk factors, the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week), and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]). |  This study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. |  Among experimental smokers, the majority (64%) were receptive to tobacco marketing, which had a multivariate association with higher level of lifetime smoking (movie smoking did not). |

difference between the two antibiotic prophylaxis regimen (one single dose or three days) for patients undergoing TRUS guided biopsies. |  In 69 per cent of patients not receiving P.I.E. bacteremia developed, and 32 per cent acquired bacteriuria; whereas only 19 per cent of patients given P.I.E. alone or in combination with gentamicin because bacteremic, and 9.5 per cent had postbiopsy bacteriuria. |  In a multivariate analysis, patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with a history of prostatitis had higher microbiological and clinical failure rates, respectively, than those without such conditions. |  Of 23 patients who received the study drug 2 (8.6 per cent) had positive urine cultures at 48 hours compared to 9 of 25 (36 per cent) from the placebo group. |  There was no significant difference among the three groups in noninfective complications but the incidence of infective complications in group A was significantly higher than in groups B and C (P < 0.01). |  Overall, only seven patients (1.8% of the cases) had positive urine cultures with no difference between these three groups. |  Urinary tract infection rates were greater in the netilmycin-metronidazole group: 17% (8 of 47 patients) versus 2% (1 of 54) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group, p = 0.01. |  Microbiological success (no bacteriuria > 10(5) organisms/mL, or bacteraemia, after TPB) was observed in 98 of 103 men (95%), of whom 48 received PT and 50 cefuroxime. |  Both of these antibiotic regimens produced a statistically significant reduction in urinary infection (p<0.02, p<0.05). |  There was no significant difference among the three groups in noninfective complications (27, 29 and 31 in groups 1-3, respectively) but the incidence of infective complications (19, six and eight, respectively) was significantly higher in group 1 (P = 0.003). |  When parenteral piperacillin alone in Group B (n = 22) was administered, the rates of the same complications were 9 and 14%, respectively, while both rates were as low as 4% in Group C (n = 25) when piperacillin in combination with povidone-iodine enema was given. |  Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not reduce the frequency of fever or bacteremia but did produce a significant reduction in bacteriuria (0 versus 21%, p equals 0.008). |  This prospective study showed that short-term prophylaxis with P/T was associated with a low rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, requiring no further treatment, whereas although the rate was similar on long-term prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin patients required further treatment, with one needing hospitalization. |  Though there was no statistical significant difference in the rates of bacteriuria following administration of trimethoprim and gentamicin, data appear to favour trimethoprim prophylaxis. |  Efficiency control was determined by the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and complications in both groups after statistical analysis. |

0.041). |  In the maternity ward, quality of obstetrical care at admission, delivery and post-partum care globally improved in all facilities after the implementation of the programme although some indicators remained poor, such as filling in the partograph directly during labour. |  Between 6 and 24 months post-partum, proportions of women using modern contraception varied from 52 to 65% among HIV-positive women, and from 65 to 75% among HIV-negative women. |  Family planning-HIV integration using the referral model improved family planning service utilization by clients accessing HIV services, but further improvement is possible. |  The HIV prevalence rate was 19% among single women aged 20-24 years and 25% among single women aged 25-45 years. |  Provider-initiated testing and counselling is feasible and acceptable in family planning services, does not adversely affect the quality of the family planning consultation and increases access to and use of HIV testing in a population who would benefit from knowing their status. |  Documented RPR screening was improved after implementation of PMTCT research and service were operating simultaneously and not with research or service alone. |  Men attending facilities with higher client loads were 88% less likely to receive family planning information and 93% less likely to receive contraceptives than those attending facilities with lower client loads. |  Overall uptake of HIV testing was 60.7% for parents and 94% for children. |  Women were as likely as men to achieve high attendance rates before the interventions, but more likely to do so at both 6 months and 1 year postintervention (after adjustment for the other variables). |  Observational data demonstrated that providers who participated in the training intervention delivered PMTCT counseling of a consistently higher quality than did providers who did not undergo training. |  The average staff workload was found to be 50.5% (8-147%) for facilities providing PMTCT of HIV infection and 37.8% (11-82%) for facilities without PMTCT services. |  Clients interviewed after the introduction of family planning services received significantly more family planning counselling and accepted significantly more contraceptives than those clients served before the intervention. |  Access to and information about hormonal contraceptives resulted in increased use and reduced attrition among both HIV-positive and HIV-negative women in this study. |  Community-based reproductive health agents (CBRHAs) can increase community knowledge of and

of HIV diagnosis, and of these, the proportion initiating ART during pregnancy. |  We completed an audit cycle, and showed that all aspects of our care had improved since the introduction of this integrated service. |  A multipronged family planning intervention can lead to high nonbarrier contraceptive uptake and reduced pregnancy incidence among women in HIV-1-serodiscordant partnerships. |  HIV transmission between discordant couples was 0 infections/100 follow-up years (95% CI, 0-3.2); vertical transmission from mother to child was 11 infections/100 live births (95% CI, 4.6-21.9); These rates are significantly lower than expected rates of transmission in Haiti. |

p < 0.01). |  Wound infection scores were marginally higher in the placebo group, but the differences in the values of infection scores between both the groups were not statistically significant during the 7-day post-PEG follow-up. |  A single dose of Cefazolin prophylaxis does not reduce the overall peristomal wound infection in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy. |  Thirty-three patients completed a prospective double-blind, randomized study to compare the effect of antibiotic prophylaxis or placebo on percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy-associated wound infections. |  The control group (no antibiotic prophylaxis) exhibited significantly more peristomal wound infections of degree III (n = 8) than antibiotic prophylaxis group 1 (n = 0, P < 0.001) or antibiotic prophylaxis group 2 (n = 1, P < 0.012). |  Antibiotic prophylaxis with a single dose of co-amoxiclav significantly reduces the risk of infectious complications after percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy and should be recommended. |

significant differences between the two groups at either point in postoperative Short Form-36 or Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment instrument scores. |  Using otherwise identical prostheses the early results were much better with a cemented Thompson stem than with an uncemented Austin Moore stem. |  The functional result was significantly superior in the hydroxyapatite-coated group. |  At 6

Total hip arthroplasty conferred superior short-term clinical results and fewer complications when compared with hemiarthroplasty in this prospectively randomized study of mobile, independent patients who had sustained a displaced fracture of the femoral neck. |  The Barthel Index and EQ-5D scores did not show any differences between the groups. |  The health-related quality of life measure was in

|  The revision rate within the first year was highest for internal fixation (25 per cent), but many of the replacements also required a further anaesthetic for reduction of a dislocation (Moore, 11 per cent; Howse 12.5 per cent). |  Two years after operation there was no statistical difference between the rate of complications in the two groups. |

95% CI, 5.27 to 16.42; P < .001) and less frequent douching (mean difference, -0.76; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.37; P = .001). |  The results revealed that over a 6-month period, compared to girls in the health promotion intervention, the girls in the HIV risk-reduction interventions had significant higher scores on HIV transmission knowledge, condom attitudes, and self-efficacy to use condoms. |  Significantly more intervention women carried condoms, discussed condoms with partners, and had higher self-efficacy to use condoms with primary partners. |  A risk-reduction intervention consisting of three small-group sessions significantly decreased the rates of chlamydial and gonorrheal infection among Mexican-American and African-American women at high risk for sexually transmitted disease. |  According to intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to the HIV-prevention group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum than individual-care and attention-matched controls; they demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual intercourse compared with individual-care and attention-matched controls. |  To evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors, sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), and pregnancy and enhance mediators of HIV-preventive behaviors. |  The condom promotion intervention led to increased self-reported condom use up to 6 months following intervention as well as positive changes in perceived benefits of condom use, affective attitudes toward condom use and condom users, perceived acceptance of sexuality, control over the sexual encounter, perceived self-efficacy for condom use, and intentions to use condoms. |  The treatment group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in AIDS knowledge and intentions to use condoms, and fewer sex partners at the six-month follow-up as compared to the control group. |  We found no differences between neighborhoods with and without the POWER campaign with regard to our primary outcomes. |  These results provide partial support for the hypothesis that an IMB model-based intervention leads to reductions in sexual risk behavior and suggest directions for future research. |  This randomized controlled trial indicates that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for reducing behavioral risk and preventing STIs and UPs in young, sexually active women who are not seeking health care. |  At 1 month, compared with control participants, intervention participants had increased sexual risk knowledge and more positive attitudes toward condoms and tended to use condoms more with a nonmain partner. |  The computer-based transtheoretical model-tailored intervention resulted in a 70% increase in reported dual-method contraceptive use in a group of women at high risk for STIs and unintended pregnancy. |  At 3-month follow-up, those who saw the video and received counseling were 2.5 times more likely to have used a condom at last intercourse with their main partner than teens in the usual care group. |  Self-reports revealed that those assigned to the interactive video were significantly more likely to be abstinent in the first 3 months following initial exposure to the intervention, and experienced fewer condom failures in the following 3 months, compared to controls. |

limited advantage over cranberry extract in the prevention of recurrent UTIs in older women and had more adverse effects. |  The therapeutic effects of cranberry juice in the prevention and treatment of urinary tract infections in general are well documented. |  Cultures of 75% (114 of 151) of the 151 samples obtained during consumption of placebo were positive for a pathogen (>/=10(4) colony-forming units/mL) compared with 75% (120 of 160) of the 160 samples obtained during consumption of cranberry concentrate. |  There were 34 episodes of UTIs in this cohort: 5/27 (18.5%) in G1, 11/26 (42.3%) in G2 and 18/27 (48.1%) in the G3, with at least one episode of infection (p<0.05). |  Patient enrolment in the 'Non-antibiotic versus antibiotic prophylaxis for recurrent urinary-tract infections' (NAPRUTI) study was started in September 2005. |  We found a reduction in the likelihood of UTI and symptoms for any month while receiving the cranberry tablet (P<0.05 for all). |  These between-group differences were not significant, relative risk (RR) 0.51 |  The presence of urinary symptoms at 3 days, 1-2 weeks, and at ≥ 1 month was similar between study groups, with overall no marked differences. |  Cost savings were greatest when patients experienced >2 symptomatic UTI's per year (assuming 3 days antibiotic coverage) and had >2 days of missed work or required protective undergarments for urgency incontinence. |  Cranberry extract taken in capsule form did not reduce bacteriuria and pyuria in persons with SCI and cannot be recommended as a means to treat these conditions. |  The cumulative rate of first recurrence of urinary tract infection during the 12 month follow up differed significantly between the groups (P=0.048). |  Multivariate analysis revealed that patients randomized to MH did not have a significantly longer UTI-free period compared to placebo (HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.68-1.35, P=0.75). |  There was a statistically significant difference in interleukin (IL)-6 of the urinary cytokines between the multiple daily cranberry dosing group (group A [C, C]): median, 3.16 (range, 0.01 to 7.34) and the placebo group (group C [P, P]): 9.32 (0.53 to

odds ratio (OR) 1.3; p=0.301). |  Survival curve analysis showed that any of the 3 treatment groups involving group behavioral therapy or placebo gum were equally effective and superior to the minimal contact plus 2 mg of nicotine gum treatment in terms of abstinence. |

birth weight, placental weight, head circumference, and Apgar score were not significantly different and there were no stillbirths in either group. |  There was no significant difference in the birthweights of the babies in each group. |  There was some reduction in preterm delivery, neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and jaundice in the labetalol-treated group. |  Plasma uric acid and creatinine concentrations were increased less markedly in the nicardipine group (P < .05 and P < .01, respectively). |  The outcome for the newborns was similar in both groups concerning birth weight, head circumference and Apgar score and in the frequencies of respiratory distress, bradycardia and hypoglycemia. |  Atenolol given once daily significantly reduced blood-pressure, prevented proteinuria, and reduced the number of hospital admissions. |  More patients went into spontaneous labour following labetalol than following Aldomet; the Bishop score was also higher in this group. |  Satisfactory blood pressure control (diastolic pressure less than 90 mmHg) was achieved in 86% of patients receiving hydralazine alone and 91% of those on combined therapy. |  A significant drop in systolic (P less than 0.005) and diastolic (P less than 0.05) blood pressure was observed in the group of patients treated with pindolol as compared with the methyldopa group. |  Birth weight was significantly lower in group B, where regimen included propranolol, compared to that of group C, for whom the regimen included pindolol (3,044.7 +/- 443.8 and 2,709.6 +/- |  The results suggest metoprolol to be more efficacious with regard to control of hypertension and fetal outcome in cases of pregnancy induced hypertension. |  Blood glucose levels were lower in the labetalol group at 6 hours of age (p < 0.05). |  There were no differences between the two groups in mean systolic or diastolic pressures, mean gestational age, or initial laboratory findings at time of entry. |

there were no proven carriers, and there was no evidence of toxicity, particularly in children. |  The mean duration of fever was four days in the ciprofloxacin group and about five days in the ceftriaxone group (p = 0.04). |  Although ciprofloxacin was more effective in the elimination of Salmonella enterica serovars Typhi and Paratyphi A from bone marrow than chloramphenicol, there was still an impressive persistence of Salmonella in the bone marrow culture (67%). |  The median time to fever clearance was 3·95 days (95% CI 3·68-4·68) in the chloramphenicol group and 3·90 days (3·58-4·27) in the gatifloxacin group (HR 1·06, 0·86-1·32, p=0·59). |  Causative microorganisms were Salmonella typhi (8 in group A, 11 in group B) and Salmonella paratyphi B (14 in group A, 13 in group B). |  The clinical cure rate was 64% (40/63) with ofloxacin, 76% (47/62) with ofloxacin-azithromycin, and 82% (51/62) with azithromycin (P = 0.053). |  The two groups of patients were statistically homogeneous regarding both age and sex and all patients were followed for 30 days after the end of therapy. |  A 100% cure was observed in each treatment group and no serious side effects were observed. |  Apyrexia and resolution of digestive and neurological symptoms were obtained in a significantly shorter time with pefloxacin than with cotrimoxazole. |  Median (95% confidence interval) fever clearance times were 92 hours (84-114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105-164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (Hazard Ratio[95%CI] = 2.171 [1.545-3.051], p<0.0001). |  The MIC(90) (range) of azithromycin was 8 (4 to 16) microgram/ml for the isolates. |  The median FCT was 106 hours in both treatment arms (95% Confidence Interval [CI]; 94-118 hours for gatifloxacin versus 88-112 hours for azithromycin), (logrank test p = 0.984, HR [95% CI] = 1.0 [0.80-1.26]). |  Short-course treatment with oral ofloxacin (5 days) is significantly better than that with ceftriaxone (3 days) and will be of particular benefit in areas where multiresistant strains of S. typhi are encountered. |

differences with treatment in favor of sertraline over placebo beginning at week 4. |  The adjusted mean difference, -3.45 in favor of paroxetine, was statistically significant (95% confidence interval=-5.60 to -1.29, p=.002). |  Withdrawals due to adverse events were infrequent (5.5% [9/163] for paroxetine and 1.3% [2/156] for placebo). |  Nine children appeared to have moderate to significant clinical improvement, but statistical comparisons on several ratings failed to confirm a trend in favor of CZP. |  Fluoxetine patients (n = 21) had significantly lower CY-BOCS scores than placebo patients (n = 22) after 16 (but not 8) weeks. |  The 3 active treatments proved acceptable and well tolerated, with no evidence of treatment-emergent harm to self or to others. |  At the end of 8 weeks, CMI-treated patients showed a mean reduction in Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale score of 37% compared to 8% in the placebo group. |  OCD response (phase I) and relapse (phase II) criteria were based on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement Scale and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale. |  Fluoxetine was associated with significantly greater improvement in

two week period prevalence was 48.8% compared with 58.1% in controls, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 16.0%. |  Both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer. |  Stored water in intervention households was less contaminated with Escherichia coli than stored water in control households (P < 0.0001). |  The results show a 50% reduction of the incidence rate of diarrhoea and a 85% reduction of the proportion of deaths related to diarrhoea in the villages with intervention. |  This intervention is a useful tool for preventing waterborne diseases in families in developing countries who lack access to potable water. |  The 1702 people in households receiving the disinfectant had a prevalence of diarrhoea that was 40% lower than that among the 1699 people using standard water-handling practices (0.9% versus 1.5%; P = 0.001). |  The SWS was equally effective with or without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (P = 0.73 for interaction), and together they reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (IRR = 0.33, 95% CI = 0.24-0.46, P < 0.0001), days with diarrhea by 54% (IRR = 0.46, 95% CI = 0.32-0.66, P < 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea by 47% (IRR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.34-0.83, P < 0.0056). |  This impact was evident throughout the year, but particularly in the monsoon season, and in all age groups except those less than 6 months old. |  An intervention trial with comprehensive prevention and control for diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of East Fujian, China during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health. |  The home chlorination intervention group had the lowest diarrheal rate (28.8/1,000 subjects/month) despite lack of access to piped water in their homes. |  Annual incidence of diarrhoea in 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size. |  There were 103 episodes of HCGI during 10,790 person-days at risk in the sham group and 82 episodes during 11,380 person-days at risk in the active treatment group. |  Children under 5 years of age whose families were not using chlorinated water had twice the risk of diarrhoea compared to children from the participating families (odds ratio = 1.98, P = 0.047). |  In this study area, under non-epidemic conditions, the reduction of faecal bacteria in the public drinking-water supply by chlorination does not seem to be a priority intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea. |  For children less than five years old, the reduction in risk was 83% (95% CI = 51-94%; P < 0.001). |  Water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics. |

between the LBW experimental and LBW control children on cognitive scores culminated in significant group differences on the McCarthy GCI at ages 36 and 48 months, when the LBW experimental group caught up to the NBW group. |  Using linear regression analysis, intervention was associated with improved scores: Portage: +4.3 GQ points (95% CI 1.6 to 7.0); parent adviser: +3.4 GQ points (1.4 to 6.1). |  Their mothers rated their infants' temperaments more optimally, expressed more realistic developmental milestones and child-rearing attitudes, and received higher ratings on face-to-face interactions. |  There was no significant difference in biological factors among the two premature groups and in cultural and social factors among the three groups. |  The low birth weight infants obtained significantly lower Bayley mental and motor scores, and were more passive and less intense than the higher birth weight infants. |  There was no difference in the age of loss or acquisition of reflexes and general abilities between the intervention and control groups. |  The intervention group showed the greatest improvement. |  At-risk infants had higher mean neurodevelopmental scores throughout the study period and lower 1-year development quotients (DQ) than normals. |  There was no significant difference in Mental Development Index (-0.9 points; 95% CI, -5.0, 3.2) or Psychomotor Development Index (2.5; -3.3, 8.4) scores between the intervention and control groups and no significant effect of intervention on Mental Development Index or Psychomotor Development Index scores for subgroups dichotomized by gestational age (<28 weeks/> or =28 weeks), parity (1st/other child) or mother's cohabiting status (supported/unsupported). |  At 36 months of chronological age, as compared to controls, children in intervention group exhibited higher scores in personal-social subscales ([mean (S.D.)]=101.4 (9.3) vs. 92.9 (12.1), P=0.02), eye-hand coordination (92.7 (4.5) vs. 87.1 (9.9), P=0.041), practical reasoning (98.6 (8.2) vs. 89.4 (10.1), P=0.01). |  Experimental infants tended to exhibit better motor and mental performance and had 23% fewer cerebral palsy diagnoses at 1 year, but these trends were not statistically significant. |  COPE mothers were significantly less stressed by the NICU sights and sounds and had significantly stronger beliefs about what behaviors and characteristics to expect from their premature infants. |  The T group subjects with high levels of parental compliance had better scores on the AIMS than those with lower parental compliance (p = 0.05). |  There were no differences between the groups in cognitive or motor outcomes. |  The Behavioral Rating Scale of the BSID-II (P = .000) and the IBA (more approach [P = .003] and less stress [P = .001] over time) also favored the intervention infants. |  The data we present reveal the considerable effectiveness of the IHDP intervention in enhancing several aspects of early and later child and family development. |  The results indicated the experimental infants made significant gains in neurological development (p less than .001), weight gain (p less than .04), and mental development (p less than .05). |  It is concluded that this amount of occupational therapy in at-risk children does not have a relevant effect on neurological development. |  Changes in mental development were not independent of changes in the GLOS. |  Orientation and State Regulation of infant behavioural profiles, the STAI and LCC scores significantly improved in the EIP group (mean difference (95% CI):

there were no differences with regard to the outcome for pain and mobility. |  Arthroplasty is more clinically effective and cost-effective than reduction and fixation in healthy older patients with a displaced intracapsular fracture of the hip. |  After two years the rate of failure was 43% in the internal fixation (IF) and 6% in the arthroplasty group (p < 0.001). |  There were no postoperative deaths and no significant differences in hospital stay. |  Internal fixation proved to be a less time-consuming operation, gave a shorter hospitalization time and was associated with a significantly reduced morbidity rate compared with prosthetic replacement. |  Hemiarthroplasty is associated with better functional outcome than internal fixation in treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients. |  The range of passive hip motion in the three groups of patients did not differ significantly (p>0.05). |  Despite high early complications, THA resulted in least pain and most mobility both in the short and long-term and was encouraging with a revision rate of only 6.25%. |  There was a trend towards decreased mobility in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.066). |  The mean patient survival was significantly higher in the group undergoing reduction and internal fixation (79 months) compared with that with a cemented Thompson hemiarthroplasty or a cemented Monk

patients over 75 years old. |  No difference could be demonstrated in the mortality rates, fracture- or operation-related complications or the need for secondary intervention. |  After the operation, the fracture patients had a lower Harris score than the arthrosis patients, and this was most pronounced among those who had undergone osteosynthesis. |  There are no randomised trials comparing internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty for a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture in relation to mental state. |  Hip function was significantly better in the THR group at all follow-up

(P = 0.03) after correcting for both center effect and defect anatomy. |  Significant differences were found when comparing the multifaceted bone graft collagen-membrane technique to all others in achieving superior defect fill. |  Both Emdogain (enamel matrix derivative) and ePTFE treatment show significant better results as compared to the WMF procedure in which there were no significant changes in PAL gain and PD reduction at baseline and 1 year after surgery. |  Initial PD (P= 0.01) and baseline tooth mobility (P= 0.036) were significant covariates. |  Probing bone level gain was significantly greater in the DBM+CS group compared to controls (P < 0.05). |  The groups were well balanced with respect to all prognostic variables. |  No differences were observed in terms of baseline oral hygiene and defect characteristics among the 3 groups, indicating that the blocking approach was effective. |  Reduction in probing pocket depth (PPD) at 12 months postoperatively varied between 2.54 and 3.06 mm between the four treatment modalities, but overall no main effect of MEM or AB was found. |  No differences were observed in terms of baseline oral hygiene and defect characteristics among the 3 groups, indicating that the blocking approach was effective. |  There were no significant differences found between treatment groups for any of the tested variables. |  At 12 months probing depth reductions were significantly greater at the Gore-Tex treated sites (P<0.05) but no difference in probing attachment level gains were found when compared with conventional flap surgery. |  All three regenerative treatments led to higher CAL gain than the control treatment (p<0.05). |  At 1-year, probing pocket depth reductions were 4.3+/-2.3 mm in GTR treated sites and 3.0+/-1.5 mm in the flap control sites (p=0.02, paired t-test). |  In all surgical areas, treatment resulted in significant improvement of parameters such as attachment levels and probing depths, as well as index values for plaque and bleeding on probing. |  0.95 mm, while no gain was observed in the control lesions (P less than 0.01). |

the atropine group, -0.578D in the cyclopentolate group, and -0.914D in the saline group. |  The differences in the increases of the spherical equivalents were not statistically significant in the right eye, but in the left eye the change in the distant use group was significantly higher (-1.87 D) than in the continuous use group (-1.46 D) (p = 0.02, Student's t test). |  After 2 years there had been statistically significant increases in myopia and axial length in both groups; however, there was no difference in the increases that occurred between the two groups. |  Use of PALs compared with SVLs slowed the progression of myopia in COMET children by a small, statistically significant amount only during the first year. |  Different near phoria (p < 0.01) and gender (p = 0.02) caused different treatment effects when wearing SV lenses. |  Rigid gas permeable lenses did not slow the rate of myopia progression, even among children who used them regularly and consistently. |  Pirenzepine is effective and relatively safe in slowing the progression of myopia during a 1-year treatment period. |  During the first 24 months, the pattern of change in myopia differed between the two groups (p = 0.041), with those in bifocals showing slower progression. |  Progression was much faster during the first 6 months, which was during the school year, than during the second 6 months, which included all of the summer vacation (0.64 D/yr vs 0.29 D/yr). |  Of the 15 serious adverse events reported in 12 subjects (all in the active groups), none was ophthalmic in nature, all subjects recovered, and only 1 (abdominal colic preceded by a flu) was judged possibly related to treatment. |  The use of PALs slowed myopia progression, although the treatment effect was small, as previously reported in ethnically diverse children in the United States. |  Undercorrection produced more rapid myopia progression and axial elongation (ANOVA, F(1,374)=14.32, p<0.01). |  It was also found that

community intervention Hartslag Limburg succeeded in preventing age- and time-related unfavorable changes in energy intake, fat consumption, walking, and bicycling, particularly among women and those with low SES. |  Significant positive changes were observed in knowledge levels at a community level in the district of intervention compared with baseline knowledge levels particularly in relation to a heart healthy diet, beneficial level of physical activity, the causes of high blood pressure and heart attack and the effects of high blood pressure and active and passive smoking on health. |  Intervention students had a lower increase in BMI (P=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted BMI (P<0.02) over time than controls. |  The intervention, consisting of paid advertisements, public relations, and community participatory planning, attained high levels of awareness and effected significant sustained population-wide changes among the most sedentary in Wheeling. |  The female cohort in Båtsfjord had a more favourable development when compared with changes in the control communities regarding the 11.2% increase in use of low-fat milk (p = 0.046), the increase in systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg (p = 0.024), and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmHg (p < 0.001). |  The intervention demonstrated no evidence for an impact on vegetable consumption, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption and weak evidence for a small impact on (intermediate) outcomes of fruit consumption. |  The proportion who increased their body mass was 14.2% lower in the intervention district (P < 0.001), implying a 50% relative reduction compared with the control district, and was lower across subgroups. |  There were no differences in self-reported knowledge of the benefits of physical activity, attempts to increase exercise, or prevalence of physical inactivity between Pawtucket and the comparison community. |  Smoking prevalence declined (from 27.9% to 17.6%) in the intervention population. |  Early results show comparability of education and comparison communities for most variables. |  More respondents in the intervention (82%) than control (67%) area were aware of local health projects. |  Average daily steps increased by 896 (95% CI=599-1192) in the intervention community, but there was no increase in the comparison community (mean change -135 |  Results indicated little consistent evidence of a treatment effect on physical activity knowledge, attitudes, or self-efficacy in either men or women. |  Daily smoking had decreased by 0.9% in the intervention areas and by 2.6% in the control area at the end of the third year, but the difference was not significant. |  Although there was an increase in the rate of walking-trail use, a community-wide change in walking rates in rural communities was not documented. |  Among the dependent variables, walking showed some evidence of a positive linear trend across dose categories (P = 0.090). |  There were no statistically significant program effects detected in the independent sample surveys, although physical inactivity increased more in the comparison community than in St-Henri. |  The project had a slightly favorable intervention effect on cholesterol and smoking, but failed to have an effect on other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. |

with RA who had a total shoulder arthroplasty scored higher than patients with hemiarthroplasty. |  For the collapse-type shoulders, we could not obtain pain relief or ROM improvement with arthroscopic synovectomy, but did obtain pain relief with prosthetic replacement. |  Constant scores for the whole group improved from a mean preoperative score of 16.4 (range, 8-36) to 54.0 (range, 20-83) at last follow-up (P < .05). |  Dislocation occurred earlier than other causes of revision or complication (P < .05, analysis of variance). |  Proximal migration and glenoid erosion did not correlate with shoulder function or pain. |  There were satisfactory improvements in the mean range of active elevation (53 degrees to 75 degrees) and external rotation (5 degrees to 38 degrees); satisfactory performance of the activities of daily living had been maintained throughout follow-up. |  Satisfactory pain relief was achieved in 44 (66%) and 52 of the shoulders (78%) were described by patients as being much better or better. |  Final clinical scores (Hospital for Special Surgery scoring system) and the incidence of radiolucency and upward migration of shoulder components in 20 shoulders with rotator cuff repair by augmented subscapularis transposition were superior to those of 19 shoulders with cuff repair by subscapularis transposition alone and similar to those of 22 shoulders with intact rotator cuffs. |  The average rotation for all axes was less than 0.25 degrees for both groups and the average translation was less than 0.32 mm for all three axes including subsidence, which was less than 0.1 mm for the uncemented stems. |  Also, component loosening did not significantly influence the average pain relief, range of movement, abduction force, or function. |  There was not a significant difference in improvement in pain and motion comparing hemiarthroplasty and TSA for patients with a thin or torn rotator cuff. |  Active abduction improved by an average of 40 degrees to an average of 117 degrees. |  The clinical score of the shoulders with good repair of the rotator cuff improved considerably and continued to improve even after the first-year follow-up examination. |  The Constant score improved from a mean of 17 points (range 4 to 25) preoperatively to a mean of 63 points (range 41 to 79) at a mean of 54 months (range 48 to 73) after shoulder arthroplasty. |  The mean range of active flexion improved from 50 degrees in the hemiarthroplasty group and 47 degrees in the total shoulder replacement group to 101 degrees and 104 degrees, respectively. |  Over the five-year follow-up period, proximal migration of the cup increased in 63% of the shoulders, and the glenoid depth increased in 31%. |  In spite of the use of an uncemented humeral stem, no implant was radiologically loose or at risk. |  Radiographical analysis revealed evidence of lucencies about the humeral component in all cases and about the glenoid component in five cases. |  Preoperative and postoperative scores of the rheumatoid group were not significantly different from the arthritis group (p<0.001). |  Glenoid component loosening was the main factor of prosthesis failure in both prostheses and mainly occurred in the first 4 postoperative years. |  Motion did not improve in either group. |  Patients with both partial and full-thickness rotator cuff tears had significant improvements in terms of overall pain (p < 0.05) and satisfaction (p < 0.05). |

conventional straight type. |  Catheter configuration did not influence the catheter-related mechanical or infectious complications, and equally good results were obtained with both catheter types studied. |  The results show no significant difference in infection rates between the three groups, nor do the factors mentioned have any bearing on ESI rate. |  The one year estimated catheter survival without mechanical failure was found to be similar in the two groups: midline (59%) and lateral (51%), (0.4 less than p less than 0.5). |  There was a lower rate of exit-site infection in the Swan neck group compared to the straight catheter group (0.29 vs 0.60 episodes/patient-year, p < 0.05). |  The conventional procedure was faster than the laparoscopic (14.3 vs 21.9 minutes, p < 0.0001). |  The rates of complications related to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas infections were also significantly lower in IY than in CY, IS, or CS. |  The incidence of ESI was 1/103 and 1/95 treatment-months in the B and NS groups, respectively. |  Laparoscopic placement of a Tenckhoff catheter leads to better function than does the open procedure |  Moreover, peritoneoscopically placed catheters were found to have better survival (77.5% at 12 months, 63% at 24 months, and 51.3% at 36 months) than those placed surgically (62.5% at 12 months, 41.5% at 24 months, and 36% at 36 months) with P = 0.02, 0.01, and 0.04, respectively. |  No significant differences in catheter survival at 2 years, probability of episodes of peritonitis, or probability of exit-site infections could be demonstrated. |  Significantly higher (p < 0.01) survival rate of the curled as compared to the straight catheter. |
