with tablet acetaminophen than with effervescent acetaminophen.,paracetamol and rofecoxib combined improved the analgesic effect compared with rofecoxib alone for the first 1.5 h. rofecoxib alone and the combination of paracetamol and rofecoxib had a significantly better analgesic effect than paracetamol alone from 3 h onwards.,however, in patients with moderate baseline pain, no differences were found between the study drugs in any of the analgesic efficacy variables.,the most important finding was the statistically significantly shorter period until the onset of the action of paracetamol as against acetyl salicylic acid.,ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for sum pain intensity difference (spid),,for most pain intensity and pain relief measurements, 1000 mg acetaminophen was statistically superior to placebo, demonstrating assay sensitivity, and 10 and 25 mg doses of bromfenac were statistically better than both placebo and 5 mg bromfenac for ordinal and analog ratings of pain intensity and pain relief; 25 mg bromfenac produced significantly longer time to remedication than acetaminophen.,propacetamol bolus resulted in a much higher incidence of local adverse events than the infusion (propacetamol bolus 90% vs propacetamol infusion 52%) with no clinically significant benefits in terms of analgesic efficacy.,ibuprofen was found to be the most effective analgesic in post-episiotomy pain followed by analgin and paracetamol in that order.,both doses of diflunisal were significantly more effective than acetaminophen alone and produced peak

or acetaminophen (650 mg) as well as placebo.,the factorial analysis showed that both 1000 mg acetaminophen and 60 mg codeine made a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) contribution to the analgesic effectiveness of the combination on all measures of efficacy (sum of pain intensity differences, largest pain intensity difference, total pain relief, largest pain relief, and time to remedication).,at 1 h after dosage, pain scores were significantly less (p < 0.01) after both doses of ketoprofen when compared with placebo.,the 100 and 50 mg doses of ketoprofen and the combination were statistically superior to acetaminophen and placebo for many analgesic measures.,ibuprofen liquigel 200 and 400 mg were also significantly more efficacious than acetaminophen 1000 mg on the summary measures totpar 6 and spid 6 (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively).,statistical significance was only seen for the parameter pain intensity (spid) on comparison of suprofen 100 mg + apap 650 mg versus suprofen 200 mg.,flurbiprofen in 50 mg and 100 mg dosages demonstrated effective analgesic activity with the 100 mg dosage being at least as effective as the acetaminophen/codeine combination.,ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for the sum of pain intensity difference, total pain relief, and reduction of pain by more than 50% (p less than .05), suggesting a more rapid onset of action and a more prolonged effect by ibuprofen 400 mg.,codeine 60 mg was not consistently superior to placebo in this post-operative single dose analysis.,the mean scores for the summary variable percent sum of the pain intensity differences (% spid) were higher in all for the combination than for acetaminophen alone, and in two studies the null hypothesis of no differences was rejected.,(r)- ketoprofen possesses analgesic activity and an acceptable side-effect profile in the oral surgery pain model.,ibuprofen lysine had a significantly (p < or = 0.05) faster onset of action with greater peak and overall analgesic effect than did effect than did acetaminophen.,in addition, both ibuprofen and ketoprofen showed statistical superiority over acetaminophen at earlier time points on the time-effect curves for pain relief and pain intensity difference.,time to remedication, a measure of duration of analgesic effect, was significantly longer (p < 0.001) with naproxen sodium (median, 9.9 hours) than with either acetaminophen (median, 3.1 hours) or placebo (median, 2.0 hours).,analgesia was similar for ketorolac 10 and 20 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg; however, these treatments were superior to acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination.,statistical analyses indicated better analgesic efficacy in both pid and spid scores for the orphenadrine-acetaminophen combination over the three other treatments.,acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of analgesia, and their effects were significant for 4 and 5 hours respectively.,both nalbuphine and acetaminophen were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of total and peak analgesia.,statistically significant pain relief (mean pain intensity differences and sum of pain intensity differences) was seen in the group receiving paracetamol compared to those receiving placebo or tiaramide from 1 h to 6 h after drug ingestion.,both doses of flurbiprofen resulted in significant analgesia in comparison with placebo, acetaminophen, and acetaminophen plus codeine as measured by pain intensity difference, pain relief, and global evaluation.,although efficacy was lower for the acetaminophen-phenyltoloxamine combination than for acetaminophen alone, for every variable, the contrast for interaction was not statistically significant.,acetaminophen was significantly better than aspirin with respect to the maximum difference in the intensity of pain (p less than 0.05) and the maximum pain relief achieved (p less than 0.03) and according to the global evaluation (p less than 0.02).,there were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to the number of patients requiring rescue medication, however the time to dosing was significantly longer for those taking soluble aspirin when compared with placebo (hazard ratio 2.34, 95% ci 1.41 to 3.88, p<0.001).,overall, the combination was slightly better than acetaminophen alone.,pain relief after the initial dose of diclofenac-k (2 x 12.5 mg) was superior to placebo (p < .01 for all efficacy outcomes) and comparable to paracetamol (2 x 500 mg).,flurbiprofen was significantly superior to the acetaminophen codeine combination with respect to the number of hours until remedication.,for many efficacy variables, all active treatments were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective than placebo.

the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke.,for boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys.,the older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category, with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge.,adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither.,cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour, beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable.,two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the california tobacco surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later.,no significant interaction effects between pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on smoking susceptibility were found.,exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for white (susceptibility and ever smoking) and african american (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for hispanic adolescents.,adjusting for multiple risk factors, the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week), and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]).,among the cohort, baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, p = 0.0001), brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86, p = 0.0004), and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87, p = 0.0002).,among experimental smokers, the majority (64%) were receptive to tobacco marketing, which had a multivariate association with higher level of lifetime smoking (movie smoking did not).,compared with low exposure to cigarette advertisements, high exposure remained a significant predictor of adolescent smoking initiation after controlling for baseline covariates (adjusted relative risk: 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.97]; p < .05).,in girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% cl, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% cl, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years.,for each 1-sd increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade.,this study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions.,among non-smokers, the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke, the belief that smoking is fun, peers, siblings and mother consumption, and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers.,less than 5% (n=92) at baseline possessed a promotional item but a further 10%(n=172) were willing to use an item.,among time 1 ever smokers, both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78, 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18, 2.23), respectively], and the two estimates were not significantly different.,the more advertisements identified at baseline, the greater was the risk of being a smoker (p<0.0001).

significant increases in the rates of regression: relative risks were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.6-14.2) for anti-h. pylori treatment, 5,compared with placebo, vitamin e had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events (both active and placebo vitamin e groups, 10.9 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [hr], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 0.90-1.13]; p = .86), as well as total myocardial infarction (hr, 0.90 [95% ci, 0.75-1.07]; p = .22), total stroke (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.89-1.29]; p = .45), and cardiovascular mortality (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.90-1.28]; p = .43).,there was no difference in the standardized mortality ratios across gender or age group.,antibody titers after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that received trace elements alone or associated with vitamins, whereas the vitamin group had significantly lower antibody titers (p<.05).,the difference in the change of pgi/ii ratio between baseline and after 5-year follow up was statistically significant between the intervention groups among those who completed the supplementation: - 0.25 for the low-dose group and - 0.13 for the high-dose group (p = 0.046).,for nuclear cataract, the corresponding rates were 12.9% and 12.1% (p = 0.77).,subjects without dementia had a greater rate of infections than those with dementia (or=1.44, 95% ci=1.19-1.76).,after 6 months of supplementation, a significant increase in vitamin and trace element serum levels was obtained in the corresponding treatment groups: a plateau was then observed for the whole study.,plasma malondialdehyde decreased by 35% in both groups (p = 0.002) but not when adjusted for lipids.,a micronutrient supplement providing the reference nutrient intake administered over 8 weeks had no beneficial effect on antibody response to influenza vaccine in older people living in long-term care.,supplementation did not significantly affect contacts with primary care and days of infection per person (incidence rate ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.19 and 1.07, 0.90 to 1.27).,however, group two (antioxidant) also had increased cortical opacification of the right lens (p = 0.04), compared to group one (placebo).,the mean levels of ldl and hdl cholesterol were unaltered in the antioxidant group and the placebo group; these levels changed substantially (by -42 percent and +26 percent, respectively) in the simvastatin-niacin group.,in groups 1 l and 2 l/a, mean eye macular pigment optical density increased approximately 0.09 log units from baseline, snellen equivalent visual acuity improved 5.4 letters for group 1 l and 3.5 letters for group 2 l/a, and contrast sensitivity improved.,no late effect of antioxidant supplementation was revealed 5 years after ending the intervention neither on ischemic cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality in both genders nor on cancer incidence in women.,there was no statistically significant difference in progression rate (rate ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.74 to 1.15) or regression rate (rate ratio = 1.09, 95% ci = 0.90 to 1.33) between vitamin and placebo groups.,among treated women, b(a)p-dna adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (p = 0.03).,despite random assignment, the baseline score on the mini-mental state examination was higher in the placebo group than in the other three groups, and this variable was highly predictive of the primary outcome (p<0.001).,after 3 months treatment, analysis of oxidative stress markers showed an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma (p = 0.0389) and a decrease in plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (p = 0.0055) in the group of patients given alpha-tocopherol in combination with riluzole.,neither the primary nor the secondary outcome measures could determine whether a megadose of vitamin e is efficacious in slowing disease progression in als as an add-on therapy to riluzol.,smokers with gstm1-0 genotype had a tendency to higher baseline cca-imt values than those with gstm1-1 (0.97 versus 0.92 mm, p=0.09).,six-minute walk test and inflammatory cytokine levels remained unchanged in both groups.,no substantial short-term beneficial effect on incidence or mortality for this type of cancer occurred following daily supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals among adults with precancerous lesions of the esophagus.,neither treatment appeared to be effective in any subgroup of patients or in the prevention of any subtype of polyp defined by size or location.,smoothed relative risk curves for lung cancer incidence and all-cause mortality indicated that relative risks remained above 1.0 throughout the post-intervention follow-up.,in men, this treatment effect was 37% (95 ci, 4 to 69, p=0.028).,four hundred forty-eight participants completed the poms-bi questionnaires at both time points, with no significant differences in total mood or mood-subscale scores seen between doses.,oral supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin e levels in the experimental group.,after treatment, plasma ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased only in the vitamin-treated group, associated with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in plasma mda.,small improvements in fisk scores were recorded during placebo therapy (median improvement, 4; p = 0.03).,long-term vitamin or garlic supplementation had no beneficial effects on the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions or on gastric cancer incidence.,vitamin e had no significant effect on incidence or number of days with infection for all, upper, or lower respiratory tract infections.,there was a greater increase in the mv vs p group for serum 25(oh)d,dietary levels of antioxidants (vitamin c, beta carotene, retinol equivalents) had no effect on cartilage volume loss.,alpha-tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death and non-fatal mi (41 vs 64 events; relative risk 0.53,number of symptoms, 6 (3-8) vs 4 (3-8), p =.03; presence of fever, 36.7% vs 25.2%, p =.009; and restriction of activity, 52.3% vs 41.1%, p =.02.,aspirin lowered the frequency of all the endpoints, being significant for cardiovascular death (from 1.4 to 0.8%; relative risk 0.56 [95% ci 0.31-0.99]) and total cardiovascular events (from 8.2 to 6.3%; 0.77 [0.62-0.95]).,for cardiovascular death, there was a significant 24% reduction (rr, 0.76; 95% ci, 0.59-0.98; p = .03).,funding surgery worldwide for age-related cataract (arc), a leading cause of blindness, is a huge economic burden.,for prostate cancer incidence (n = 672), the rr was 0.88 (95% ci, 0.76-1.03) for participants receiving alpha-tocopherol compared with nonrecipients.,following vitamin supplementation, cell-mediated immune function improved as indicated by a significant increase in the absolute number of t

functional performances were lost after cessation of training.,no difference between the two groups was demonstrated in the duration of physical rehabilitation by a per protocol analysis of the patients who completed the trial.,there were significantly better results for the patients receiving treatment by active electrical stimulation (repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.001).,the clinical results in the cases who had received intensive physical therapy and those given routine physical therapy did not differ during the postoperative follow-up period of 9 weeks.,however, a significant increase in within-group variance from admission to discharge (p less than .01) was noted, and this led to the analysis of a subgroup containing six pairs of subjects matched for number of predictors of poor outcome.(abstract truncated at 250 words),there were also additional functional benefits for the weight-bearing group--improved ability to complete a lateral step-up on the affected leg with nil or one hand supports (or 3.4, 95% ci 1.1 to 12.3) and the need for less supportive walking aids (p = 0.045).,within the intervention group, improvements in quadriceps strength were significantly associated with improved performances in the weight-bearing test measures and with increased walking velocity.,patients in the ea group were more likely to be discharged directly home from the acute care than those in the da group (26.3 compared with 2.4%) and less likely to need high-level care (36.8 compared with 56%).,those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (p= 0.029).,a statistically significant difference in the overall trajectory of time in exercise was seen (p<.001), with more time spent exercising in all three treatment groups.,there was no significant difference in change in leg extensor power, or any other outcome measure, in the es group compared to usual care controls.,however, people with hip fracture and cognitive impairment gained greater benefit from the higher dose programme than from the lower dose programme.,at the 4-month retest, there were differences between the groups in the extent of improvement since the initial assessment for balance (f(10,196)=2.82, p<.001) and functional performance (f(6,200)=3.57, p<.001), but not for strength (f(12,190)=1.09, p=.37) or gait

parameters measured.,whilst auto-transfusion does not appear to compromise haemostasis, it does not reduce the requirement for homologous blood and heparin-bonding of the circuit has no impact.,no complications or episodes of hypotension, confusion, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, febrile reaction, or coagulopathy were observed during or after the reinfusion of the unwashed, filtered, salvaged blood.,the fibrin degradation products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002).,homologous blood transfusion was required in only 35% of patients in the study group compared with 95% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.001).,no statistical difference was found in the number of patients who had excessive postoperative drainage from a drained or non-drained wound.,additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between hemoglobin levels and drainage volumes in both the tha and tka study groups, compared to their respective control groups.,these values in preoperatively collected autologous blood and allogeneic blood were out of normal range; (p<0.001).,group 1 required 15 units of bank blood, group 2, 90 units (p < 0.001), and group 3, 102 units (p < 0.001).,only 7% of patients in the autotransfusion group required an allogeneic transfusion compared with 28% in the control group (p<0.001).,comparison of the two groups showed no significant difference in regard to age, sex, operations performed, or total postoperative bleeding (ats 813 +/-,no complications or adverse effects were observed from reinfusion.,the length of stay was reduced in those patients who received autologous blood (9 days vs. 12 days, p < 0.05 mann-whitney u test).,use of autotransfusion effectively reduced the need for hbt and was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative sirs and infective complications.,the use of blood conservation techniques resulted in reductions of homologous blood requirements of 34%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, in groups ii to iv as compared with the requirement in group i.,significantly more allogeneic blood was required by the control group than by the reinfusion group (p = 0.022).,87.44 ml in the at patients, a reduction of 38.7% (p less than 0.05).,32 of the patients in the intraoperative cell salvage group were given any blood product, compared with 47 in the control group (odds ratio 0.47 (0.25 to 0.89); p=0.019).,there was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic blood (32% in both groups, relative risk 1.0 p = 0.89).,global coagulation tests, antithrombin iii, and total serum protein were comparable in the four groups.,the amount of hb that was transfused during the operation was significantly lower in groups ii and iii than in group i (p less than 0.0001).,no differences were noted between two groups in terms of clinical parameters; likewise the operative characteristics were similar for the two groups.,at d + 1, the hematocrit was comparable in all groups (ogr = 28%, sgr = 28.2% and cgr = 28.5%).(abstract truncated at 250 words),there were no significant differences between patients randomized to iat and control patients in estimated blood loss (ebl), allogeneic blood transfusion (units administered intraoperatively, postoperatively, and total), proportion of patients not receiving allogeneic blood (34% of patients randomized to iat and 28% of control patients), postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and complications.,there were no detrimental effects of autologous blood transfusion.,at 20 hours after surgery, an increase of serum pct concentration (>0.5-2 ng/ml) was more frequent in group 2 (58.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.03).,prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) did not increase, and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected.(abstract truncated at 250 words),in the two groups, no significant difference in the mean blood loss was observed during 24 hours after the operation (660 +/-,the preoperative reservation of autoblood in patients with ihd for operations of coronary bypass under conditions of ec and using the cell saver gives higher values of hemoglobin and erythrocytes by the moment of discharge of the patients from the hospital, but non the less does not reduce the frequency of using homologous blood.,it was also shown that autotransfusion without aspirin does reduce the need for donor blood transfusion without any increase in post-operative bleeding.,the use of the autologous transfusion system (bellovac) proved to be safe but failed to reduce the need for postoperative homologous blood transfusion following uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty.,the chest tube drainage was significantly less in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3, with total drainage (median [interquartile range]) amounting to 250 ml,postoperatively, in both groups, at iii, plasminogen, and protein c decreased.,there was no significant difference in the mean post-operative haemoglobin levels in the two groups.,total intra-hospital homologous blood replacement was not significantly different,,eligible consecutive primary and revision total hip and knee replacement patients were randomized for one of the two systems or for a control group in which shed blood was not re-infused.,the incidence of post-operative complications, such as wound infection, deep-vein thrombosis and chest infection, was also comparable between the groups.,a cost comparison analysis showed that blood salvage was more expensive than pabt, and therefore it should be limited to patients who had predeposited fewer than three units of autologous blood.,the number of patients requiring homologous blood transfusion was significantly different between the 2 groups (54/98 [55%] in autotransfused patients vs 73/100 [73%] in the control group, p =.01).,the amount of postoperative autologous blood salvage averaged 946 ml. only 25% of the study group required postoperative transfusions, compared to 83% of the control group (p = .016).,patients who received autologous blood had higher levels of haemoglobin at 8 hours (p < 0.05) and 24 hours postoperatively (p < 0.01) and needed less allogeneic blood transfusion (p < 0.01).,the mean hb concentration was significantly higher in group a on day 1,there was no significant difference in the postoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin values between the two groups.,c-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and troponin-t increased after surgery in both groups without intergroup differences.,the postoperative drainage and transfusion device was efficacious in reducing the amount of allogeneic red cells required by patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, and its use resulted in a 42 percent reduction in the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusion.,there was no statistically significant difference in transfusion requirements or wound complications among the four groups.,fibrin split products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002).,although both groups had a decrease in lung perfusion postoperatively, there were no significant differences among the groups regarding the lung perfusion scintigraphy, chest x-rays, abg, and d-dimer values.,conclusions intraoperative cell salvage and autotransfusion was associated with higher postoperative hemoglobin concentrations, a modest reduction in transfusion requirements, no adverse clinical or coagulopathic effects, and no significant increase in cost compared with controls.,postoperative chest tube drainage was higher in the patients from group a, which also had the highest postoperative d-dimer levels.,evaluation of clotting studies showed no significant differences between patients who received shed blood and patients who received liquid-preserved red blood cells.,during the first 24 h after surgery, the autotransfusion group had a significantly higher serum level of ck-mb.,in patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation.,the median amount of homologous blood required after operation by the study group was reduced by 74% from the amount required by the control group (mean, 67 ml vs 256 ml, respectively; p less than .0001).,the use of any blood product was avoided in 95% and 80% of the patients, respectively (not significant).,the estimated blood loss and cell saver return volumes were less for those patients undergoing afb for occlusive disease compared with those undergoing afb for aneurysmal disease.,in the control group, 2,3-dpg levels decreased from 4.3 to 3.9 mumol/ml erythrocyte during the same period.,there was an average saving of 1.1 unit of allogeneic blood per patient in group a (p<0.001).,their administration caused a significant increase in tat and fpa levels in groups 2 and 3 compared to group,use of cell saver reduced intraoperative net blood loss and seemed to reduce transfusions by 1 unit per patient, however, this was probably attributable to more complications leading to transfusion in the control group.,cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma utilization also was less in the autotransfusion group than in the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance.,there was no relationship between retransfusions and postoperative febrile reactions.,sonoclot coagulation analyses better correlated to both blood loss and dextran dosage than aptt and platelet count in the routine coagulation analyses.,the two groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, weight, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, and surgical procedure.,no clinically significant intergroup differences were found in hematologic, renal or hepatic parameters, neurologic function or use of antibiotics.,autotransfusion did not produce any significant derangement of thromboelastograph values or laboratory measures of clotting pathway function (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen d-dimer levels) when compared with the effect of homologous blood transfusion (p = ns, repeated measures analysis of variance [manova]).,off-pump cabg is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump cabg.,the incidence of re-exploration was zero in both the groups.,the clinical safety of this technique was confirmed by the lack of septic, hematological, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic complications.,patient bleeding times were not significantly different between the groups at any of the time points, and the total postoperative blood loss was not different between the groups.

+/-,mean morning predose percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased by 2.2%, 3.2%, and 4.6% in the fluticasone propionate, 88-, 220-, and 440-microg twice-daily, groups, respectively, compared with an 8.3% decrease for placebo (p < .001 vs placebo for all groups).,treatment of asthmatic subjects with inhaled steroids for four weeks leads to improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine, eosinophil counts in induced sputum, and exhaled nitric oxide levels.,twice daily treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms was significantly more effective than theophylline in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma.,the increase in pd(15)fev(1) from baseline was greater in the fp group than in the placebo group; the difference achieved significance within 72 hours and remained significant until the end of treatment.,bronchial responsiveness to methacholine decreased significantly only after 6 wk of treatment with fp (p < 0.05).,once-daily sfc significantly improved clinic forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (difference in means 0.129 l/s; p < 0.001) and clinic pef (difference in means 10.8 l/min; p < 0.001) compared with twice-daily fp.,fluticasone propionate produced a significantly greater increase in morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) (adjusted mean difference over

both early and late responses to allergen: the maximum % fall in fev1 during the early (0 to 2 h) and late response (2 to 6 h) was 32.6 +/-,bal inflammatory cells decreased following 3 months of treatment with no further improvement at 12 months (p<0.05 v placebo).,the combination product significantly increased (p < or =.013) area under the curve compared with placebo and fluticasone on day 1 and compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone at week 1 and week 12.,the results of methacholine challenge testing averaged over all visits favored fp 200 microg/day over placebo and fp 100 microg/day (p < 0.05); there were no significant differences between placebo and fp 100 microg/day.,compared with placebo, sm50 significantly reduced the numbers of neutrophils in bronchial biopsy samples and the concentrations of myeloperoxidase and soluble e-selectin in serum, each of which reflect neutrophil involvement.,after 4 weeks, the maximum plasma fp concentration (cmax) in this subgroup was 0.096 microg/l [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.066-0.141] and the area under the plasma fp concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable concentration (auclast) was 0.491 microg/l x h (95% ci: 0.256-0.940).,morning and evening peak expiratory flow (pef), asthma symptoms, and supplemental albuterol use also improved in all fluticasone propionate groups versus placebo.,both fluticasone propionate and flunisolide caused dose-dependent suppression of hpa axis, which was statistically greater for fluticasone propionate (p = 0.0003).,the willingness of patients to use the trial drug in daily practice if efficacy would be proved was statistically significantly related to compliance during the trial (p = 0.017).,finally, treatment with fsc resulted in significantly (p < or = 0.007) greater improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow, need for rescue albuterol, and asthma symptom scores compared with fp, s, and pla.,treatment with fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function compared with zafirlukast (p <.05) or placebo (p <.05).,values for patient-measured morning peak expiratory flow rates (pefr) were significantly (p<.05) higher and the use of rescue albuterol was significantly (p<.05) lower beginning 3 to 5 days after initiation of therapy in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate, compared with the placebo group.,serum cortisol did not change significantly in either treatment group.,at endpoint, fluticasone propionate significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p < .001), morning and evening peak expiratory flow (p < .001), and asthma symptom scores (p < or = .016), and significantly reduced nighttime awakenings (p = .016; diskhaler group only) and rescue albuterol use (p < .001).,fluticasone propionate powder twice daily (500 microg/day) was superior in efficacy to triamcinolone acetonide aerosol four times daily (800 microg/day) in patients with persistent asthma.,low-dose inhaled fp resulted in significant improvements in eno, spirometry, qol, ds, and beta2 use.,patient quality of life assessed by means of the asthma quality of life questionnaire was clinically and significantly improved after fluticasone propionate treatment (p </=.003).,partial protection was demonstrated against the late-response allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia with both treatments ( p = .001).,both significantly decreased airway responsiveness compared to placebo (p < 0.001), and also significantly increased lung function with no difference between the two active groups.,no significant difference in clinical and functional data, and in sputum eosinophil percentages was observed between the beginning and the end of the study in both groups 1 and 2.,oral candidiasis rates were 2.5% for 320-microg/d ciclesonide, 2.4% for 640-microg/d ciclesonide, and 22.0% for 880-microg/d fluticasone propionate.,improvement in morning peak flow rate were also significantly (p < 0.001) greater with fp than with placebo (8-10% increase vs. 2% increase).,between baseline and end point, mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second decreased 0.31 l in the placebo group and improved 0.39 l, 0.30 l, and 0.43 l in patients receiving 100-micrograms, 250-micrograms, and 500-micrograms fluticasone propionate, respectively.,fev1 and morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) increased during the first week of both active treatments and were stable thereafter.,methacholine improved significantly during the first 6 weeks as compared to placebo (p < 0.04) and steadily increased with time in both treatment limbs (p = 0.04), the difference in improvement between doses (100 microg fp bid, 1.6 dose steps; 250 microg fp bid, 3.3 dose steps) approaching significance after 24 weeks (p = 0.06).,fluticasone propionate aerosol was well-tolerated, and it improved some dimensions of health-related quality of life measured using a standard patient survey.,prednisone produced significantly greater suppression of hpa-axis function than did any of the inhaled corticosteroids or placebo (p<0.001).,the fp-treated children had significantly greater (p < or = .05) reductions in 24-hour daily asthma symptom scores (-53.9% vs -44.1%) and nighttime symptom scores over the entire treatment period compared with the placebo group.,the fev1, measured the morning after the last inhalation, was significantly higher after the active treatments, compared with placebo (p < 0.02), but did not differ between all active treatments.,the numbers of t cells, macrophages, and eosinophils in the bronchial wall were reduced by two weeks of treatment with fp but were unaltered by placebo.,measurements of peak expiratory flow and symptom scores significantly improved and nighttime awakenings and albuterol use to treat symptoms significantly declined in fluticasone propionate-treated groups relative to the placebo-treated group.,0.13 cm in the fluticasone propionate 100 microg group (p = 0.308, overall).,fp-treated versus placebo-treated children showed significant changes in percentage symptom-free days, use of beta2-mimetics, morning and evening pef, fev1 % pred and wheezing.,fluticasone propionate did not suppress morning plasma cortisol concentrations and did not affect 24-hour urinary free-cortisol excretion.,compared to placebo, fluticasone propionate administered qd or bid significantly improved fev(1) (p < 0.001), morning (p < 0.001) and evening peak expiratory flow (pef; p < 0.001), asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.001), and albuterol use (p </= 0.001), and decreased nighttime awakenings.,at the end of the first week of treatment, patients in both fluticasone groups had significantly greater improvements in morning pef than did those receiving placebo.,compared with placebo fluticasone propionate was associated with a highly significant decrease in airway responsiveness (1.9 doublings of the geometric mean pd20), which was maximal at the end of the 6-week treatment period.,montelukast is not as effective as low dose fluticasone in reducing or maintaining an anti-inflammatory effect in steroid naive eosinophilic asthma.,the efficacies of fp100bid and fp200qd were comparable with regard to improvement in pulmonary function and asthma stability in bd patients.,treatment with fsc resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow compared with fp, sal, and pla (both, p < 0.001); need for rescue albuterol compared with fp and pla (p < or =0.005); and asthma symptom scores compared with pla (p < 0.001).,two weeks of regular inhaled fluticasone discontinued 24 h before allergen challenge does not offer any additional protection against the early or late asthmatic responses, increased airway responsiveness or sputum eosinophilia compared with a single dose of 250 microg immediately before allergen challenge, despite increasing baseline pc20 and decreasing sputum eosinophilia prechallenge.,patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05).,the effects of the inhaled glucocorticosteroid fluticasone propionate (fp) on the bronchial responsiveness to nka and methacholine were studied.,the combination product significantly (p </= 0.011) reduced asthma symptom scores and supplemental albuterol use, and significantly increased the percentage of nights with no awakenings as compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fp (p </=,fluticasone propionate suppressed cortisol secretion as demonstrated by a decrease in plasma cortisol auc(0-24), relative to placebo, by 29% (95% ci 15-41) and 59% (95% ci 51-66) with 440 and 880 microg b.i.d., respectively.,there were no statistically significant differences at endpoint among the three fluticasone propionate groups.,in the fluticasone group, significant changes occurred after 6 weeks with respect to means of pc20 (an increase of 3.4 doubling doses), plateau value fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) (from 58% at randomization to 41% at 6 weeks) and baseline fev1 (from 3.46 to 3.75 l) in contrast to the placebo group.,both dry powder fp regimens significantly improved fev1, evening pef, and asthma symptoms at the double-blind phase endpoint (p < or = .017 compared with placebo).,mean change from baseline in lumbar spine (l1 to l4 ) bone density at week 104 was not significantly different between fluticasone propionate (-0.006 +/- 0.008 g/cm2) and placebo

unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old.,there is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures ao/ota 31-a1 and a2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome.,the mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw.,there were no significant differences in functional outcome between the pfna and the dhs groups.,there were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the gamma nail group.,there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the euroqol 5d outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures.,postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group.,the mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the holland nail group (dhs 4.3 days,,any potential for the tgn leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated.,decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05).,patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate.,more intra-operative complications were recorded in the gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of chinese people.,there was no difference in the rates of cutting-out of the two implants but use of the küntscher-y nail was associated with a greater incidence of shortening.,the ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the pfn group compared to the msp group with an odds ratio 2.2 (p = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67).,we found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review.,internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing.,peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time.,we found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters.,the two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.,at an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.--,femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the gamma nail group (2%) and none in the richard's group (p = 0.13).,clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases.,the reduction in the hrqol (eq-5d(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005).,there were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups.,no differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality.,there was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study.,the operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for dhs implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group.,limb shortening was similar in both groups and was not affected by leaving the gamma nail unlocked distally in unstable fractures.,the intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001).,mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation.,there was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the gamma nail.

proinsulin, split proinsulin and free fatty acid levels compared with glibenclamide.,rosiglitazone, but not insulin, induced a recovery of pancreatic beta-cell function, as evidenced by the restoration of the first-phase insulin response to glucose, improvement in the disposition index, and a decrease in the proinsulin-to-insulin ratio in subjects with type 2 diabetes in whom oral antihyperglycemic therapy failed.,patients in the g + p and g + r groups experienced significant increases in mean bmi at 12 months compared with baseline (4.92% and 6.17%, respectively; both, p <

< 0.05) between groups.,homeostasis model assessment index improved at 12 months in both groups.,both rosiglitazone (n=56) and insulin (n=56) significantly improved fasting glucose (2.4 and 3.7 mmol/l, respectively) and hemoglobin a1c concentrations (1.1% and 1.3%, respectively).,clinically significant decreases from baseline in hba1c were observed in drug-naive patients at all rosiglitazone doses and in patients previously treated with oral monotherapy at rosiglitazone 8 mg o.d. and 4 mg b.i.d.,rosiglitazone, compared to metformin, induced a prompt and profound reduction in hscrp levels independent of its effect on glycemia.,mean changes in hba(1c) values at the end of treatment were greater for repaglinide/rosiglitazone therapy (-1.43%) than for repaglinide (-0.17%) or rosiglitazone (-0.56%) monotherapy.,glyburide was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular events (including congestive heart failure) than was rosiglitazone (p<0.05), and the risk associated with metformin was similar to that with rosiglitazone.,after 6 months of treatment, the reduction in plasma glucose levels was similar between the 2 groups.,in the rosiglitazone group, mean plasma adiponectin level was increased by more than twofold (p < 0.0005), whereas no change was observed in the placebo group.,metformin-glibenclamide tablets resulted in significantly greater reductions in hba1c and fasting plasma glucose compared with metformin plus rosiglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy.,ldl particle concentration was reduced with pioglitazone and increased with rosiglitazone (p < 0.001).,ejection fraction did not change in either group.,the skeletal muscle glucose uptake was increased by 38% (p < 0.01) and whole-body glucose uptake by 44% in the rosiglitazone group.

the final ratings in each group.,for total scores on the tdi, we were unable to demonstrate a significant reduction in thought pathology, although it was evident that thought disorder as reflected in the conceptual disorganization and unusual thought content subscales of the brief psychiatric rating scale is significantly reduced by neuroleptics.,at the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs.,the cumulative relapse-free survival was 88% (se = 0.12) in the continuation and 18% (se = 0.12) in the discontinuation group (p = 0.001) at 9 months follow-up.,of the placebo group 35% relapsed, relapse being related to the level of previous active medication.,drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse and readmission to hospital.,the drug was shown to be significantly more effective than the placebo in preventing relapse.,eighteen (69%) of the 26 patients available for follow-up (mean interval, 3.5 years) experienced a second psychotic relapse either during the study or afterward, and 50% (14/28) of the original sample experienced a third episode.,long-term treatment with asenapine was more effective than placebo in preventing relapse of schizophrenia and appeared to be safe and well tolerated.,propericiazine at 10 mg and 30 mg also increased the number of symptom-free days dose-dependently but at 60 mg, the number decreased.,social adjustment ratings on a special scale completed by the patients and families alike, were also found to be insensitive to treatment differences.,there was a striking absence of correlation between dyskinesia change measures brought about by benztropine and changes following neuroleptic withdrawal.,a proportional hazards regression model showed that life events made a significant cumulative contribution over time (p < 0.05) to the risks of relapse and that ceasing medication made an independent contribution.,time-to-relapse (primary endpoint) favored paliperidone palmitate (p<0.0001, log-rank test) at interim and final analysis (n=408).,these patients showed a significantly higher relapse rate than the matched control group of 26 patients who continued to receive fluphenazine (56% versus 19%, p less than .001).,aripiprazole was significantly superior to placebo from baseline to endpoint in panss total, panss positive, panss-derived brief psychiatric rating scale, and clinical global impressions-severity of illness scale (cgi-s) scores and demonstrated significantly better mean clinical global impressions-global improvement scale scores (p < or = .01 for all comparisons except cgi-s:,the data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis.,time to relapse was significantly longer in quetiapine xr-treated patients versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.16,mean fluphenazine levels between drug continuation and withdrawal conditions showed a progressively larger difference over time, although significant differences were not seen until week 8.,although quetiapine was generally well tolerated, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse or serious adverse events was greater in the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than in the placebo group (8%; 7/89) (relative risk 2.29, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 5.28; chi(2)=3.20, df=1; p=0.07).,to test the clinical efficacy of low dose fluphenazine decanoate (1.25 mg to 5.0 mg biweekly), we carried out two separate experiments: (1) an open trial in 57 schizophrenic outpatients, lasting 6 months; (2) a double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation study in a subgroup of patients who maintained good remission throughout the entire 6-month open trial.,the estimated 26-week risk of recurrence was six times lower for zotepine than placebo (8.7% versus 52.8%; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% ci 0.053, 0.484; p<0.001).,of those on active medication, 46% relapsed, as did 62% of those on placebo; the most important determinant of relapse was duration of illness prior to starting neuroleptic medication.,the olanzapine group had a significantly longer time to relapse (p < 0.0001) than the placebo group.,ziprasidone treatment was indistinguishable from placebo in assessments of movement disorders and was not associated with weight gain or cardiovascular abnormalities.,the benzodiazepine-group had a significantly higher relapse rate than the neuroleptic-group, meaning that we cannot stop neuroleptics for these patients yet.,among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol.,in the placebo group, a 50% decrease in the mean haloperidol plasma concentration was seen 8 weeks after withdrawal of haloperidol.,a poor outcome at 2 years was associated with male sex, poor outcome after the first 5 weeks of the first admission, negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission, and a diagnosis of definite or probable schizophrenia using the feighner criteria.,relapse was accompanied by a resurgence of specifically schizophrenic symptoms and by an increase in abnormalities described by the relatives.

p = 0.001).,in unannounced evaluations of home drinking water, free chlorine was detected in samples from 27% of flocculant-disinfectant households, 35% of flocculant-disinfectant plus vessel households, 35% of bleach households, and 43% of bleach plus vessel households.,this intervention is a useful tool for preventing waterborne diseases in families in developing countries who lack access to potable water.,this impact was evident throughout the year, but particularly in the monsoon season, and in all age groups except those less than 6 months old.,stored water in intervention households was less contaminated with escherichia coli than stored water in control households (p < 0.0001).,in this study area, under non-epidemic conditions, the reduction of faecal bacteria in the public drinking-water supply by chlorination does not seem to be a priority intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea.,the home chlorination intervention group had the lowest diarrheal rate (28.8/1,000 subjects/month) despite lack of access to piped water in their homes.,for children less than five years old, the reduction in risk was 83% (95% ci = 51-94%; p < 0.001).,water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics.,both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer.,children under 5 years of age whose families were not using chlorinated water had twice the risk of diarrhoea compared to children from the participating families (odds ratio = 1.98, p = 0.047).,children drinking solar disinfected water had a significantly lower risk of severe diarrhoeal disease over 8705 two weekly follow up visits; two week period prevalence was 48.8% compared with 58.1% in controls, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 16.0%.,the results show a 50% reduction of the incidence rate of diarrhoea and a 85% reduction of the proportion of deaths related to diarrhoea in the villages with intervention.,annual incidence of diarrhoea in 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size.,an intervention trial with comprehensive prevention and control for diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of east fujian, china during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health.,diarrhoea rates were not significantly different among the participants while exposed to water treated with hypochlorite.,water in homes was contaminated (43.4%) with more than 1100 total coliforms/100 ml due to the use of unclean utensils to transport and store water.,among the 108 children in households allocated solar treatment, diarrhoea was reported in 439 of the 2-week reporting periods during the 12-week trial (average 4.1 [sd 1.2] per child).,the sws was equally effective with or without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (p = 0.73 for interaction), and together they reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (irr = 0.33, 95% ci = 0.24-0.46, p < 0.0001), days with diarrhea by 54% (irr = 0.46, 95% ci = 0.32-0.66, p < 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea by 47% (irr = 0.53, 95% ci = 0.34-0.83, p < 0.0056).,analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (p = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket.

97.5% ci, 0.53-0.98; p = .02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not cbi.,however, the cbt-naltrexone group did better than the other groups on a variety of outcome measures.,although subjects in both groups reduced their consumption of both alcohol and cocaine during the 8-week trial, there was no consistent advantage to ntx over placebo treatment.,patients treated with nalmefene also had fewer subsequent relapses (p<.03) than patients given placebo.,overall, naltrexone showed only modest effects in reducing alcohol drinking for the 12 weeks of treatment.,subjects treated with an active medication had significantly more consecutive weeks of abstinence and less craving than those treated with placebo, but there were no significant group differences in other measures of alcohol consumption.,participants in any of the randomized groups who were entry abstainers had significantly better improvement on all of the primary outcome measures.,also, there were no significant differences between the study groups concerning secondary effectiveness measures as well as compliance and adverse clinical events--with the exception of the gamma-gt, which was significantly greater reduced in the naltrexone group throughout the study.,the active medication group showed better medication compliance, while the number of adverse events was low overall and not significantly different by group.,our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence.,the most common adverse events (nausea and headache) occurred at a similar rate for patients in both treatment groups.,naltrexone treatment was associated with significantly more adverse neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal effects, poorer compliance, and a greater rate of treatment attrition.,naltrexone was not better than placebo in the supportive groups, but it had a significant effect in the coping groups: 27% of the coping/naltrexone patients had no relapses to heavy drinking throughout the 32 weeks, compared with only 3% of the coping/placebo patients.,individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of beta-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in beta-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives.,the 40 mg group had a significantly lower rate of relapse (p < or = 0.05), and a greater increase in the number of abstinent days/week (p < or = 0.09), than the other treatment groups.,long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy.,naltrexone proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems, including abstention rates, number of drinking days, relapse, and severity of alcohol-related problems.,although more subjects in the active medication groups terminated the study early secondary to adverse events, the rates did not differ significantly from that of placebo.,the combined medication was most effective with significantly lower relapse rates than placebo and acamprosate but not naltrexone.,there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the outcome variables at baseline or follow up measurements.,compared with placebo, the srp of ntx significantly reduced the frequency of heavy drinking days during the injection and follow-up periods.,naltrexone treated patients had significantly fewer drinking days, heavy drinking days (>5 drinks) and reported less craving compared to the placebo treated patients.,intent-to-treat analyses suggested that there was no overall efficacy of naltrexone and no medication by psychosocial intervention interaction.,on an intention-to-treat basis, the kaplan-meier survival curve showed a clear advantage in relapse rates for naltrexone over placebo (log-rank test, chi(2)(1) =,naltrexone seemed to reduce relapse rate to heavy drinking, but we found no differences in other alcohol consumption variables between naltrexone- and placebo-treated groups.,the relapse rates between the two groups were not significant (p = 0.671).,there were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate.,rates of cocaine use and drinks per day did not differ between treatment groups; however naltrexone did reduce frequency of heavy drinking days, as did cbt without cm.,drinking reductions at 3, 6, and 12 months correlated with more use of coping skills, lower urge, and higher self-efficacy.,the survival function showed that patients treated with aripiprazole remained abstinent from any alcohol amount for a longer time with respect to those treated with naltrexone.,the study completion, therapy participation, and medication compliance rates in the trial were high, with no differences between treatment groups.,these results are supported by the lower levels of liver enzyme activities (p < 0.010 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase), but not by the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin levels, in the naltrexone group.,interactions were observed between medication group assignment and both craving level prior to randomization (p = .02) and family loading of alcohol problems (p = .05).,medication interactions were found for cocaine use via urine drug screens (three way, with time) and self-reports (two way) for drug severity (two way) and alcohol use (two way).,naltrexone depot subjects also had significantly fewer drinking days during treatment and a significantly greater abstinence rate than the placebo group (18% vs. 10%).,the overall results are encouraging; 42% of the subjects had a remission of their depression and had no drinking relapses during the trial.,naltrexone treatment response was significant within the group of 75 individuals who were homozygous for oprm1 asn40 allele.,there were no differences in the frequency of any self-reported adverse effects or in liver enzyme values between the placebo- and naltrexone-treated groups.,among those with eating disturbances, symptoms of eating pathology improved during treatment, but the effects did not differ according to medication condition.,subjects taking naltrexone reported significantly less alcohol craving and days in which any alcohol was consumed.,more patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated patients.

observed between the two treatment groups with respect to the incidence of spontaneous versus induced labor, need for oxytocin augmentation, gel-to-induction interval, bishop score change, maximum oxytocin dose, maximum dilatation rate, length of labor, cesarean section rate, fetal apgar scores, fetal umbilical vein ph, or fetal umbilical artery,there were no significant differences in relation to cesarean delivery rate, apgar scores at 5 minutes, and arterial umbilical cord ph, although the power of our study was limited to detect differences in proportions of adverse outcomes.,no difference was demonstrated in mean time to delivery, 28.3 versus 24.0 hours (p = .19) or percent requiring cesarean section.,bishop scores were altered in all patients not proceeding to labor spontaneously, but the changes were most significant in the low- and high-dose groups.,the cesarean rate was also significantly lower in the pge2 group (13.1 versus 31.6%, p = .016).,both groups were similar with respect to change in bishop score, start-to-delivery interval, amount of oxytocin required, mode of delivery and success of induction.,coarser side effects did not occur in our group, and there is also no higher incidence of surgical deliveries.,there were four failures of induction of labor in group 2 and none in group 1 (p < 0.05).,in the three groups no differences were observed among 128 subjects in the weekly bishop scores, cervical dilatation or gestational age upon admission to the labor and delivery suite, the percentage of patients presenting with spontaneous labor or ruptured membranes, the number of post-date inductions or neonatal outcome.,the 2 mg intravaginal gel and the 0.5 mg intracervical gel were equally effective and more effective than the 1 mg intravaginal gel in labor characteristics such as ripening time and cesarean section rate, but not in labor time.,uterine hyperstimulation and perinatal outcome were similar in both groups.,contrary to current opinion, intracervical dinoprostone gel does not appreciably lower the cesarean section rate when used at this dose and route before labor is induced.,cervical state did not change significantly (bishop score 3.6 and 4.0) after 24 hours in patients receiving placebo gel.,in addition the induction-delivery interval was shortened (median times 9.0 h vs. 11.3 h) and fewer cesarean sections were performed (16% vs. 21%) in the pge2 gel series.,twelve patients in the pge2 group and two in the placebo group were delivered within 24 h (p less than 0.001).,no serious adverse reactions were observed.,the pge2 pessary appears to be more effective with 68% of patients either going into labour during cervical ripening or succeeding in the cervical ripening compared to around 50% in the atad and pge2 gel groups.,as estimated by life table analysis, the pessaries were significantly more effective inducing vaginal delivery compared to intracervical gel (24 h: p less than 0.025, 48 h: p less than 0.01, logrank test) and vaginal delivery was obtained within 24 h/48 h in 50%/72% of the women in the pessary group and in 29%/55% of the women in the intracervical group.,the results obtained showed a significant increase in bishop's score 12 hours after cervical ripening, irrespective of the way pge2 was administered: from 2.3 +/-,since signs of myometrial hypercontractility were observed in the pge2 treated group as compared to the control group (p = 0.01), the authors advocate careful cardiotocographic monitoring for at least three hours after the gel application.,the median interval to delivery was significantly shorter in the pge2 group, at 2.5 days, compared with placebo, at 7 days (p = .02).,our results show that intracervical pge2 gel seems to have a better effect on the ripening of the cervix than the intravaginal one if we only consider the proposition of softening success (group a 14/52; group b 6/48).,the 53 women who received the placebo gel had an outcome similar to that of the 47 women who received the prostaglandin e2 gel.,minprostin gel (group i) and minprostin tablets (group ii) were equally effective in ripening the cervix.,there were no significant differences between the groups except in the incidence of patients going into labor within 72 hours.,in patients with unfavorable bishop scores the intravaginal application route resulted in a better cervical ripening, a shorter induction to delivery interval and a higher cumulative rate of deliveries during 24 h (p=0.01).,twenty-three of 30 treated patients had uterine contractions lasting greater than four hours and eight patients delivered during the observation period.,misoprostol is more cost-effective than the comparable commercial dinoprostone prostaglandin preparations as an adjuvant to labor induction in women with an unfavorable cervix.,there was no significant difference in parity, gestational length, maternal characteristics, indications for induction or preinduction cervical scores between the treatment groups.,during the observation period, spontaneous labor occurred in a significantly greater percentage of patients in the treatment group (27%) than in the control group (2%).,adverse perinatal outcome in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies of > or = 41 weeks is very low with either of the management schemes described.,there was also no difference in cesarean delivery rate, antepartum fever, hyperstimulation, apgar scores, birth weight, or umbilical artery ph.,compared to control subjects, patients in the group given prepidil had significant increases in cervical bishop scores, shorter induction-to-delivery intervals, lower maximum doses of oxytocin, and fewer days of induction.,overall success, defined as a progression in bishop score of at least 3 points within 12 hours, was achieved in 22/40 (55%) of the gel group, 15/41 (37%) in the tablet treated women, and 8/40 (20%) in those receiving placebo.,compared with intracervical therapy prostaglandin e2 given intravaginally was more likely to significantly change the bishop score (60.4% vs 40.4%, p = 0.04) and stimulate regular contractions (72.9% vs 48.1%, p = 0.01).,endocervical prostaglandin e2 had a more marked effect on cervical ripeness than did vaginal prostaglandin e2, but this did not result in any differences in more substantive outcomes.,gastrointestinal side effects were registered after intravaginal but not after intracervical application.,significantly better results for both cervical priming and labor induction were obtained after intracervical pge2-gel application than after treatment with placebo or vaginal suppositories.,there were no significant differences in the number of antepartum tests, labor inductions, or cesarean sections, the maximum oxytocin dosage, or the interval from admission to delivery in the prostaglandin e2 gel and placebo gel groups (n = 90).,p less than 0.0001) resulting in a lower cesarean delivery rate, 26 vs. 47 per cent (p greater than 0.05).,the following mean times were shorter for the pessary group than for the gel group: (1) insertion of the ripening agent to vaginal delivery (20.6 vs 26.4 hours, p = 0.017), (2) time to achieve cervical ripening (11.1 vs 15.2 hours, p < 0.001), (3) time to achieve active labor (18.3 vs 25.5 hours, p = 0.019), and (4) hospital stay (3.7 vs 4.4 days, p = 0.03).,dinoprostone vaginal insert is more efficient than cervical gel in promoting cervical priming and labor induction in low-bishop-score patients at term.,there was no significant difference between the two groups in the use of instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections nor was there any difference with regard to fetal distress.,intracervical administration of dinoprostone with prelabor rupture of membrane at term and unripened cervix shortens the interval to delivery without a significant increase of maternal or neonatal morbidity.

lower scores (fewer symptoms) for fatigue, pain, financial difficulties, weight loss and chemotherapy side effects; and higher scores (more symptoms) for constipation and gastrointestinal symptoms compared with apr patients.,in general, men had lower social well-being scores, and younger patients had lower physical and emotional well-being scores and colorectal concerns scores.,patients without a terminal abdominal stoma had a better score in six categories of the qol 30 and in two categories of the cr38.,overall, quality of life was good but cpa patients had better quality of life scores than apr and lra patients.,the failure rate was higher for older patients (p = 0.005) and for coloanal pull-through anastomosis (p = 0.001).,overall, patients with rectal cancer recover well in the long run, with hrqol levels comparable to that of the general population.,a significantly ( p< 0.001) greater number of patients in the abdominoperineal resection group stopped praying daily (either alone or in a mosque) and fasting during ramadan.,we found convergent and divergent validity and good reliability of the fact-c. patients' overall qol was lower at one month after colectomy and recovered to the pre-surgery level at six months after colectomy.,there was no significant difference in both the short-term and the long-term complication rates between the two groups of patients.,the quality of life was significantly better after resection than after excision, most clearly so according to the grogono index, and this was also reflected in the patients' personal assessment.,stoma construction (n = 51) was associated with a higher global health status (83 vs. 75, p = 0.019), and these patients reported fewer gastrointestinal problems (p = 0.001).,stoma patients experienced greater financial worries (p = 0.0029), whereas nonstoma patients had greater gastrointestinal concerns (p = 0.0098).,the presence of a stoma did not affect the qol of the male patients, while it did affect that of the female patients.,although patients having had apr tended to report a lower body image score (p = 0.12) and more sexual dysfunction in male patients, all apr patients tended to report better physical function, future perspective and global qol.,male patients with a stoma had more sexual problems than males without a stoma (p = 0.015).,both genders had impaired sexual life; however, males had significantly higher values and felt more distressed by this impairment.,the only significant difference between the two groups was found in the total score of the symptom-specific scale in favour of anterior resection (p = 0.02).,no difference was detected in any sf-36 health survey hrqol domain among the groups, although there were differences within groups before and after surgery.,no significant results were obtained for the remaining scores, but patients undergoing ape consistently had more favorable qol scores than those undergoing ar.,there was no significant difference in global health-related quality of life between patients with and patients without a stoma at any time point.,based on the sf-36v2, statistically significant and meaningful differences between female cases and controls were observed for seven of the eight scales and on the physical and mental component summary scores.,patients with lar had a better body image (p.001), dietary habits (p.003) and tolerance to stress (p.004).,mean qol scores for body image and male sexual problems were better following ar than apr (p<0.01), also in patients with a low (< or = 3 cm) anastomosis.,quality of life scores for the various factors studied showed that quality of life was worse in women, in patients with tumors in the middle third of the rectum, and in patients undergoing low anterior resection.,high-anterior resection patients had significantly better scores than both low-anterior resection and abdominoperineal extirpation patients.,the sf-36 and eortc qlq-cr38 (sexuality subscale) scores of the survivors were compared to an age- and sex-matched dutch normal population.,eortc qlq-c30 physical scores were also higher among rectal cancer survivors than in the general norwegian or german population (p =.0005,improvements in quality of life from the first to the third year after diagnosis in patients who remained free of disease were very modest and limited to less financial difficulties, a better future perspective and fewer stoma-related problems.,physical function and overall quality of life were better in patients aged 69 and younger, while patients aged 70 and older suffered from fatigue.,preoperative radiation was associated with postoperative ejaculation problems (p = 0.028) and anal incontinence (p = 0.012).,ostomates and ostomates did not differ regarding the cumulative score of stool-related questions: 83.75 +/-

symptoms (ces-d mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; p <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm hg,patients in the intervention group received enhanced education and increased frequency of visits by a psychiatrist working with the primary care physician to improve pharmacologic treatment.,at 3 months, improvement was higher in the tm group in the subscales of physical function, pain, general health, energy, emotional role, mental health and standardized physical and psychic scales of sf-36.,telephone-based collaborative care for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder is more effective than usual care at improving anxiety symptoms, health-related quality of life, and work-related outcomes.,overall response rates favored those assigned to tdm compared with those assigned to usual care (39.1% responded vs. 17.6%, p= 0.022).,compared with patients assigned to usual care, those in the intervention group were 21 times as likely to receive preferred treatment.,in the quantitative assessment, the intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvements in depression (odds ratio 4.33, confidence interval overlapping 1).,changes in resource utilization were favorable for the intervention group, but differences from the control group did not achieve statistical significance.,those randomized to cm exhibited less mh problems at the conclusion of the trial, indicating that the close monitoring program is effective, feasible and valuable.,when compared with the group receiving tau, there was a trend for the intervention group to experience less depression in time.,the telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, p =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, p =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant.,this program of telephone-delivered cbt combined with a pedometer-based walking program did not improve a1c values, but significantly decreased patients' blood pressure, increased physical activity, and decreased depressive symptoms.,improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001).,compared with control patients, intervention recipients had lower mean phq-9 values in depression symptoms

number of women taking antidepressants after 3 months was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (multicomponent intervention from 60/101 [59%; 95% ci 49-69%] to 38/106 [36%; 27-46%]; usual care from 18/108 [17%; 10-25%] to 11/102 [11%; 6-19%]).,telehealth care improved mental functioning at 6 weeks (47.07 vs 42.64; p =.004) and treatment satisfaction at 6 weeks (4.41 vs 4.17; p =.004) and 6 months (4.20 vs 3.94; p =.001).,despite few resources and marked deprivation, women with major depression responded well to a structured, stepped-care treatment programme, which is being introduced across chile.,centralized telecare management coupled with automated symptom monitoring resulted in improved pain and depression outcomes in cancer patients receiving care in geographically dispersed urban and rural oncology practices.,there was no difference in the rate of new prescriptions for, or adequate dosing of, anti-depressant medications.,self-diagnosed depressed women (vs nondepressed women) had more depressive symptoms and acute care visits, worse general and mental health, and greater impact of health problems on regular activities.,when compared with usual care patients, intervention patients showed greater improvement in adequacy of dosage of antidepressant medication treatment in the first 6-month period (odds ratio [or], 4.15; 95% confidence interval

seen.,90% of intervention patients rated their depression care as good or excellent at six months compared with 75% of usual care patients (p = 0.0003).,intervention patients had significantly fewer depressive symptoms, but not fewer episodes of relapse/recurrence over the 12-month follow-up period.,intervention patients with minor depression were found to have a significant decrease over time in depression severity on only 1 of 4 study outcome analyses compared with usual care patients.,blinded interviews by telephone 3 and 6 months after the initial prescription included a 20 item depression

over time compared with uc patients on anxiety, depression, and disability measures, with the greatest effects at 3 and 6 months.,integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91).,in patients with major depression, the intervention group had greater adherence than the usual care controls to adequate dosage of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more (75.5% vs 50.0%; p < .01), were more likely to rate the quality of the care they received for depression as good to excellent (93.0% vs 75.0%; p < .03), and were more likely to rate antidepressant medications as helping somewhat to helping a great deal (88.1% vs 63.3%; p < .01).,at 6 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant differences the 2 groups in hamd or sf-36 scores or any of the secondary outcome measures.,intervention participants were more likely to report treatment response (33.3% vs 17.5%) (odds

the sedentary controls either became more depressed or reduced their participation in pleasant, socially oriented activities.,no differences were observed between groups, except for a trend toward greater improvement in hdl cholesterol levels in the ex group (p = 0.07).,multiple regression analysis indicated that the improvement in quality of life depended on the participation in exercise programmes, the effects of training and the reduction in the level of depression.,exercise training in rhuepo-treated hemodialysis patients resulted in an improved aerobic exercise capacity, whereas those without exercise training did not have increased capacity.,after training significant improvement occurred in physical capacity (vo2max increased from 16.8+/-6.2 to 23.2+/-7.6 ml/kg/min, p < 0.05).,exercise did not alter gfr, hemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, serum lipids, or c-reactive protein (crp).,improvement of the variables in the yoga-based exercise program was found to be superior to that in the control group for all the variables except calcium, phosphorus, hdl-cholesterol and triglyceride levels.,the exercise program had no effect on qol scores and this was most likely due to the short duration of the exercise program and high-functioning level of the population studied as compared to normative data for this patient population.,in the trained group, changes in oues correlated with those in the maximum oxygen uptake (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) and the anaerobic threshold (r = 0.61, p < 0.01).,moderate- to high-intensity strength training improves physical performance, nutritional status and quality of life in people with chronic kidney disease and in dialysis patients.,the serum albumin levels and cgr increased in the training group compared with baseline.,there was an overall improvement in pwv, and to a lesser extent bnp levels, with 3 months of intradialytic exercise compared with no exercise, suggesting that regular exercise in eskd may be associated with improvements in arterial compliance and a reduction in cv risk.,the eg had a significant increase in aerobic capacity, 'squat test' and physical function and physical component scale (sf36).," at baseline hrv index, mean rr, sdnn, and aerobic capacity were significantly reduced in both hemodialysis groups compared with values in group c. also, 40% of all patients on hemodialysis and 16% of group c had arrhythmias (lown class >ii).,support group participants reported a significant decrease in pleasant activities while there was no change in the exercisers.

p less than .01) and length of hospitalization (p less than .05).,the infusion tom took a mean 13 h less than the other two methods, which were statistically indistinguishable.,this trial determined that early catheter removal may be feasible and desirable in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy.,postoperative normal bladder function resumed more rapidly when transurethral closed drainage was used (p < 0.05).,in a randomized trial, treatment of urethral stricture by direct visual internal urethrotomy with 3 days of postoperative catheterisation was found to be sufficient, given minimal complications, and had a cure rate of 85% after 6 months and 80% after 1 year follow-up.,in study 1, infection was significantly reduced with respect to all parameters in the group receiving two doses of cefotaxime, and total drug treatment costs were halved.,there were no statistically significant differences in either the duration of continuous catheter drainage before the return of spontaneous voiding or the incidence of urinary tract infection in the two groups.,residual volumes exceeding 200 ml and need for recatheterisation occurred in 9% in the standard prolonged catheterisation group versus 40% of patients in the not prolonged catheterisation group (or 0.15, 95% ci 0.045-0.47).,the postoperative urinary tract infection rates of groups a and b were 16.6% and 23.3%, respectively ( p>0.05).,the results show that those patients who were less time under vesical drainage presented a minor frequency of urinary retention after surgery (24.3% vs 30.7% and 43.7%).,no significant difference was noted in the incidence of uti (5 vs. 10, p = 0.25), with a trend towards less uti in group 1.,delayed voiding occurred in 13 (28.9%) and 10 (21.7%) patients, respectively, and 5 (11.1%) and 3 (6.5%), respectively, received a new catheter.,catheter removal on day 1 led to a significantly shorter post-operative hospital stay (2.3 days versus 3.3 days) and did not incur a higher incidence of complications.,there was no significant difference in bacteriuria after 14 days (50.0 vs. 53.3%).,asymptomatic bacteriuria at catheter removal was found in 21.0% of suprapubic and in 12.5% of transurethral catheter patients.,a randomized prospective study was set up to assess the role of postoperative catheter drainage and the value of hydraulic self-dilatation of the urethra after internal urethrotomy.,the early removal of in-dwelling catheters after operation was not associated with an increased rate of febrile events, urinary tract infections, or need for recatheterization.,in addition, 29% of the catheterized group had urinary tract bacteriuria compared with 13% of the uncatheterized group (p < 0.025).,there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to pathology, weight of prostatic resection, mean volume of first void, or time to first void after catheter removal.,urinary retention after 7 days was present in 23.99% with suprapubic vesical drainage and 28.5% with urethral catheter.,of 25 patients catheterized for both group postoperative urinary retention occurred in 2 (8%) and required a new catheter.,no significant difference in recurrence rate was found between the two groups studied by means of voiding interview, uroflowmetry and retrograde urethrography.,patients who had their catheters removed at midnight passed a greater volume of urine with both their first (268 ml compared with 177 ml; p<0.0001) and second voids (322 ml compared with 195 ml; p<0.0001) than their counterparts in the 0600 group.,removing the catheter at midnight allows patients to return to a normal voiding pattern more rapidly and to leave hospital earlier.,bladder infusion before a tov after turp significantly increases the rate of readiness for discharge, allowing an early decision to discharge on the second day in a large proportion of patients.,at follow-up after one year, postoperative bacteriuria was closely correlated to increased rates of both clinical cystitis and asymptomatic significant bacteriuria.

time of inclusion in the trial.,patients with acute enteritis showed a significantly faster resolution of bowel abnormalities during treatment with enterococcus sf68 compared with placebo.,the time to recovery after early treatment was 79 h vs. 139 h in the placebo group (p = 0.02); 1 of 17 patients treated early vs. 6 of 13 in the control group still had loose stools 120 h after start of treatment (p = 0.03).,the frequency and duration of diarrhea, requirement for intravenous therapy, and hospital stay were significantly lower in both the intervention groups compared with the controls.,administration of l. rhamnosus strains shortens the duration of rotaviral diarrhoea in children but not of diarrhoea of any aetiology.,in the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance.,there was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in diarrhoea frequency on day 2 between probiotics (3.3 [loose stools]; 2.5-4.3) and placebo (4.7; 3.8-5.7) groups.,significant differences were observed on days 14 (ecn 93.3%, placebo 65.8%, p = 0.0017) and 21 (ecn 98.7%, placebo 71.1%, p < 0.001).,median duration of

(108 h).,the duration of diarrhea was 82 h in the treatment group vs. 101 h in the control group (not significant, p = 0.07).,stool frequency was less on the second day in the lactobacillus group (p < 0.05).,l. reuteri effectively colonized the gastrointestinal tract after administration and significantly shortened the duration of watery diarrhea associated with rotavirus.,however the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05, study group vs control group).,even on day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ors use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group.,there was no significant reduction in diarrhea duration and stool output in the group.,s. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically.,lgg supplementation does not decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting in children with awd, and does not reduce hospital stay in these patients.,no significant difference was observed by 48 hours in those presenting with bloody diarrhea.,hospital stays were significantly shorter in group b than in group a. administering oral rehydration solution containing lactobacillus gg to children with acute diarrhea is safe and results in shorter duration of diarrhea, less chance of a protracted course, and faster discharge from the hospital.,stools had a normal consistency on day 3 in 38 (76%) of 50 patients in the s. boulardii group compared with only 12 (24%) of 50 in the control group (p = 0.019).,duration of diarrhea and number of stools were significantly less in group y compared with group m. forty-eight hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 62% of

positive findings in 25 out of 30 control subjects.,significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days (p=0.035), reduction in diarrhea frequency (p=0.049) and weight gain (p=0.017).,there was no difference between the study group and control group in the frequency of diarrhea stools on the day before admission (p > 0.05).,no effect of st11 treatment on severe rotavirus diarrhea was observed.,no intergroup differences were found in beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, and glycocholic acid hydrolase levels.,a statistically significant difference was observed in the number of stools on the 4th and 7th day favouring the subgroup that received early treatment (within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea).,patients receiving lgg had a significantly shorter duration of watery diarrhoea [mean (sd) 2.7 (2.2) days] than those receiving the placebo [3.7 (2.8) days, p = 0.03].,the number of patients showing a response was clearly higher (p < 0.0001) in the ecn group (52/55; 94.5%) than in the placebo group (39/58; 67.2%).,patients receiving sf 68 had a reduced duration of diarrhea compared with placebo, with a highly statistically significant difference between treatments.,mean duration of diarrhea was decreased (p = 0.034) with l. acidophilus lb (43.4 hours) versus placebo (57.0 hours).,interferon- gamma and il-12 were mildly elevated in the

p < 0.01) and for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ii and more severe lesions (100.0% vs 80.0%; p < 0.01).,adding a high-risk hpv test in secondary screening increased the identification of women with cin2-3 lesions by 33% in comparison with repeat cytology (p=0.01).,the sensitivity of the second pap smear and hpv-dna test to detect cin 2-3 was 61 (95% ci = 45-74) and 82% (95% ci = 67-91), respectively.,sensitivity to detect cin3 or above by testing for cancer-associated hpv dna was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [ci] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy.,hpv testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin2+).,they showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between negative p16 expressions of pap smears with the presence of reactive lesions in follow-up biopsies and hr-hpv viral load.,for lsil, the sensitivity was 75% (3 of 4 specimens) for p16(ink4a) and 100% (4 of 4 specimens) for hc2.,the hpv dna triage showed a good accuracy (specificity over 94%, sensitivity of 37% and ppv for cin2+ lesions around 30%).,the surepath, inform hpv, and hc2 correctly identified high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsils) in 15 (94%) of 16, 6 (38%) of 16, and 14 (93%) of 15 cases, respectively.,genotyping of discordant results showed a prevalence of lr-hpv types in hc2 positive/amplicor negative samples, and a similar prevalence of hr- and lr-hpv types in amplicor positive/hc2 negative samples.,hybrid capture ii positive rates were 93.3% for cases with cin iii, 72.2% for cin ii, and 51.0% for cin i (p <.001).,age did not appear to be a factor in determining which cases went on to manifest high-grade disease within 3 years of a low-grade result (p=0.678).,for women with ascus, hpv testing was highly sensitive for detecting cin3 and cancer with dramatically fewer referrals of older women.,compared with hpv dna testing, which detected 87.5% (7/8) of the cases of cin 2 or 3, repeat pap smear showing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (hsil) detected 11.1% (1/9) of cases (p = 0.004), and repeat pap smear showing ascus, lsil or hsil detected 55.6% (5/9) (p = 0.16).,the sensitivity and specificity of the repeat pap smear alone for the detection of cin 2/3 were 73.7% and 62.9%, respectively, when referring all women with a repeat pap smear using an ascus-positive threshold.,high-risk group hpv detection can be used as an additional triage test to detect hsils in women having asc-us with high sensitivity and negative predictive value.,two abnormal quadrants (90% vs. 38%</= cervical intraepithelial neoplasia,in each group, the detection rate of grade 2,3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin 2,3) or cervical cancer in patients with positive hpv dna was significantly higher than that with negative hpv dna (p<0.05).,the proex c immunocytochemical assay can be integrated into a clinical cytology laboratory and may increase the ppv of lbc for biopsy-proven hsil.

peripheral blood lymphocytes [sfc/106 pbl]) and week 52 (median, 1930 sfc/106 pbl), but there was an inverse correlation between response and the number of spot-forming cells.,also, secondary analysis showed no difference between the two strategies in terms of safety, retention of immune reconstitution, and clinical therapy failure.,long term treatment will increase the frequency of: i) drug-related side effects; ii) onset of drug-resistant viral strains; iii) non-adherence of the patients to the treatment.,consistent with a loss of phenotypic susceptibility to lamivudine, the m184v mutation was detected by genotypic analysis (direct and clonal sequencing) in plasma samples collected from two patients at the end of the second or third sti.,in these patients, there was no evidence of mutations suggestive of drug resistance, and plasma saquinavir levels were within the expected range.,the plasma viral load (pvl) noted after > or =2 years without antiretroviral therapy remained significantly lower than the pvl noted before initiation of haart, for 11 of the 26 patients (i.e., for 18% of the 60 patients who had sti performed).,there were no significant changes in glucose or insulin levels or in anthropometric measurements.,t cell counts, no significant increase in cd4(+) or cd8(+) t cells expressing activation markers or producing ifn-gamma in response to hiv, no increase in cd4(+),although some disturbances appear at the resumption of therapy, no definitive problems are found that preclude such therapeutic approaches from a psychological perspective.,(iv) the increase in hiv-specific cd8(+) t lymphocyte frequencies induced by sti was not correlated with decreased viral set point after sti; and (v) hiv-specific cd4(+),kinetic studies demonstrated that viruses expressing resistance mutations could be detected for >5 months after the discontinuation of treatment in some patients.,patients with lower cd4 cell counts at therapy initiation were more likely to resume therapy than were those with counts of >500 cells/mm3 (<200 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 4.4]; and 200-350 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 2.9]).,in contrast, group b patients showed no significant changes in immunological parameters during a prolonged drug-free period.,l was not statistically different from the control group.,during the first cycle, plasma hiv rna increased to > 50 copies/ml (range, 67-88) in five patients at day 4, in eight patients (> 100 copies/ml) at day 8 and in 12 patients (> 100 copies/ml) at day 14.,those subjects who controlled viral replication developed significantly stronger hiv-1 specific cellular immune responses than subjects lacking spontaneous decline (p < 0.05).,in 14 of 25 and in 3 of 25 subjects, the m184v and the l90m mutations, respectively, were detected as minor populations, at different times during sti.,the duration of the first interruption and the reduction of time on therapy were related to nadir cd4+ cell count.,cd4 nadir was a significant predictor for treatment reinitiation in a multivariate analysis.,cd4 lprs to p24 increased significantly (p = 0.001) between day 0 of the first sti cycle and 4th sti but decreased thereafter.,no significant differences were observed between haart and hu groups in na, ctl and lpr at any time-point.,at enrolment, hiv-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of il-16 and rantes, and significantly lower concentrations of mcp-1, than did healthy controls.,t cell counts, and showed no enhancement of antiviral cd8(+),although numbers of ctls did increase over the same time that viral rebounds decreased, there was no correlation between ctl count and either viral rebound rates or clearance rates.,sti in chronically hiv-1-infected patients is not associated with reductions in cd4 t lymphocytes or to clinical complications in this group of patients after 2 years of effective plasma viral suppression.,after haart resumption and consequent inhibition of hiv replication, vgamma9vdelta2 t cell reactivity was restored both quantitatively and functionally.,four out of 7 patients in the haart group failed to control hiv by week 6 and had to restart therapy due to either viremia rebound or cd4 decrease.,in 10/12 interrupter patients a rebound of hiv-1 rna was detected in all three structured treatment interruptions (sti).

treatment than with low-dose qw treatment (85% vs 33%; p < 0.001).,there was no significant difference in time to confirmed progression of edss scores between placebo-treated patients and either of the ifnbeta-1b treatment groups.,the cumulative numbers of gd-enhancing lesions and new t2wi lesions in the ivig groups were reduced in comparison with the placebo group.,there were also significant

significantly higher in group i than in group ii (90 vs 30% at 12 months, p < 0.01).,on bismuth, only one patient became helicobacter pylori-negative (8.33%, p < 0.0001), but ulcers healed in 8/12 patients (67%, p = ns).,the eradication rates of h. pylori in the full analysis set were 0% in group a-lpz-only, 87.5% in group b-lac200 and 89.2% in group c-lac400 for gastric ulcer and, 4.4% in group a-lpz-only, 91.1% in group b-lac200 and 83.7% in group c-lac400 for duodenal ulcer.,among the dual therapies, higher eradication rates occurred when lansoprazole (with amoxicillin) or clarithromycin (with lansoprazole) was administered t.i.d.,the recurrence rates of duodenal ulcers confirmed by endoscopy in these three groups were 64%, 33% and 0% at the third month, and 73%, 67% and 5% at the sixth month, respectively.,the three schemes of treatment were effective for ulcerous healing with 70.5%, 82.3%, and 78.2%, respectively, without significant differences.,omeprazole plus clarithromycin dual therapy eradicated h. pylori in 83% of patients with duodenal ulcer and significantly decreased 12-month recurrence from 76% to 6%.,the prevalence of h. pylori was 82% and the eradication rate 88% in the omc group and 3% in the op group.,h. pylori recurred in 13 patients and the reinfection rate was 44.8% over two years.,among the 52 patients given antibiotics, h. pylori was eradicated in 46, as compared with 1 of the 52 given placebo (89 percent vs. 2 percent, p < 0.001).,the co-prescription regimens gave high h pylori eradication rates determined using two tests (clotest and 13c-urea breath test) for the presence of the organism.,hp eradication was achieved in 82% of the ome + amx group, but in 0% of the ome group.,on an intention-to-treat basis, omeprazole/amoxicillin led to cure of h. pylori infection in 67.1% (47 of 70) of patients not using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)/aspirin (asa) and in 46.7% (14 of 30) of those taking nsaids/asa (p < 0.05).,h. pylori eradication occurred in 0% of the cimetidine group and in 73.7% of the double-therapy group (p = 0.004).,the ulcer healing rate was 90.2% (95% confidence interval (95% ci): 79-97%) in the omeprazole group at 6 weeks as compared to 83.3% (95% ci: 70-93%) in the triple therapy group (p = 0.38).,at five weeks, h. pylori had been eradicated in 41 of the 45 patients in the antibacterial-treatment group (91.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 82.9 to 99.3) and in 5 of the 40 in the omeprazole group (12.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 22.7; p < 0.001).,rapid, complete, and persistent suppression of gastroduodenitis activity and gastric surface epithelium lesions was observed in most hp-eradicated group,there was no duodenal ulcer recurrence in 43 h. pylori-negative/cured patients (0%), which was significantly different in terms of duodenal ulcer recurrence (p=0.001).,the relapse rate at the 3rd month was 11.7% (2/17) in the triple therapy group and 60% (6/10) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.0248).,clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients with duodenal ulcer associated with h. pylori infection.,treatment with an antibiotic only regimen was effective for the healing of duodenal ulcer, and clearance as well as eradication of h pylori contributed significantly to the healing.,eradication of h. pylori was significantly better with lansoprazole with triple therapy than with either lansoprazole with amoxycillin or lansoprazole alone (90% vs. 55% vs. 3%, respectively).,h. pylori eradication rates as diagnosed by culture, histology, urease test, and [13c]urea breath test 4 weeks after stopping therapy were 0, 0, 8, 45, 6, 46, and 62%, respectively, in groups i-vii.,triple therapy eradicated h. pylori in 51 patients [intention-to-treat, 84%; 95% confidence interval (ci), 75-93%].,the differences in the eradication and relapse rates between o vs. omc and o vs. oac were statistically significant (all, p < 0.001).,reinfection rates at 6 months were 42.1% and 15.1% in groups b and c, respectively (p < .05).,during a 12-month follow-up gastric ulcer relapsed in 20/32 (63%) of the persistently helicobacter pylori positive patients.,gastric ulcer relapse was observed in 49% of patients who were h. pylori positive and in 2% who were h. pylori negative after treatment.,the difference (higher relapse rate for omeprazole-treated patients) was significant (p < 0.001) by the second evaluation, 4 months after treatment.,histopathological results showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between eradicated and non eradicated patients in terms of severity of inflammation and intestinal metaplasia, but not in terms of atrophy.,combined therapy with anti-h. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing.,eleven patients in the triple therapy group suffered from adverse effects (45.8%) (p < 0.05 as compared with other groups).,the cure rate for h. pylori infection was 4.2% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 38.5% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.01) for gastric ulcers, and 0% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 61.9% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.001) for duodenal ulcers.,the minimal inhibitory concentration of lansoprazole for h. pylori in vitro is lower than that for omeprazole, prompting interest in treatment with amoxicillin plus lansoprazole.,in the omeprazole/amoxycillin group 93% (67/72; 95% confidence interval 84% to 98%) of gastric ulcers healed and 83% (29/35; 66% to 94%) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.103).,however, the overall failure rate (absence of healing, relapse) was lower (p = 0.04, log-rank test) in the antibiotic group in which all relapses but one were observed in h. pylori positive patients.,triple therapy had a similarly high healing rate to h2-blocker therapy (100% vs 90.5%) at two months of follow-up.

cortisol/creatinine ratio between treatment groups at 12 weeks (p=0.001) indicated suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the patients on beclomethasone 1000 microg twice daily.,combined salmeterol fluticasone therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in pefr and symptom control than doubling the dose of fp.,both the salm 50 and salm 100 groups had a significantly increased percentage of symptom-free and rescue-free days and nights compared with the bdp 1,000 group, and there was no difference between the two salmeterol groups.,the overall mean morning premedication pef for the entire treatment period was higher in the formotero/bdp group (p=0.002).,the hazard ratio for both comparisons was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.6;

microg bid, treatment with fp 220, microg bid, significantly increased fev1, morning and evening pef, and percent symptom-free days, and significantly reduced rescue albuterol use, number of nighttime awakenings, and overall asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.035).,the increase in mean morning pef-the primary efficacy measure-was significantly higher for budesonide/formoterol compared with budesonide alone (16.5 l/min vs 7.3 l/min, p = 0.002).,no significant differences between groups were found in fev1, pd20 methacholine, symptom scores, and exacerbation rates after 1 yr.,salmeterol added to low-dose beclomethasone was superior (p < or = 0.05) to doubling the dose of beclomethasone in improving peak expiratory flow (pef) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (fev1), and in reducing symptoms of asthma, sleep loss, nighttime awakenings, and use of albuterol.,no significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, eg2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ecp levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with bud200+f or bud800.,this was accompanied by a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow in the fp400 + salm group in both the morning and evening compared to the fp1000 group.,over weeks 1 to 24, morning peak expiratory flow was increased by 47 l/min from baseline with salmeterol treatment as compared with 24 l/min with fp 220 microg twice daily (p < .001) while the percent of symptom-free days increased from baseline by 26% of days as compared with 10% of days (p < .001).,there were significant differences in favour of salmeterol/bdp in diurnal variation of pef (all time points) and in use of rescue bronchodilator (salbutamol) and daytime and night-time symptoms (some time points).,sm/fp250 also resulted in more symptom-free days and nights (p < 0.002) and days and nights with no relief medication (p < 0.001).,in group a, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points.,patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05).,after high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, stepping down with the combination inhaler conferred further improvements in bronchoprotection, bronchodilatation, and clinical control, but not inflammatory markers, compared with that seen with a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid.,significantly greater increases in morning pef, the primary efficacy variable, were observed in patients treated with budesonide/formoterol compared with fluticasone propionate (27.4 l/min vs 7.7 l/min; p < 0.001).,secondary efficacy measures included fev1, morning peak expiratory flow, percent of symptom-free days, and daily albuterol use.,secondary efficacy endpoints also showed fsc 100/50 microg twice daily to be more effective than fp 250 microg twice daily alone.,sfc also provided significantly better control of daytime symptoms and a significantly greater reduction in the requirement for rescue salbutamol compared with budesonide.,quality of life improved with both treatments, but without significant statistical differences between the groups.,high-dose budesonide had the broadest range of beneficial effects on other outcomes, including symptom scores, morning peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in one second.,after treatment with salmeterol there was no deterioration of airway inflammation as assessed by mast cells, lymphocytes, or macrophages in bal or biopsies, but rather a significant fall in eg1-positive eosinophils in the lamina propria (from a median 18.3 to 7.6 cells/mm, p = 0.01), which was not seen after treatment with fluticasone.

sepsis,incisional wound infections|patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (p less than 0.01).,there was no difference between the groups in deep sepsis or anastomotic leak rates (sulbactam, four patients; cefoxitin, seven patients).,deep wound infection or dehiscence was seen in 12 of 105 having both administrations of antibiotics, and in nine of 98 having only intravenous antibiotics.,the postoperative wound infection rate was significantly lower in group i patients than group ii 5.6% (6/107) and 18.4% (21/ 114), respectively (p < 0.01).,wound infection occurred in 15 patients (9.1%) and deep surgical infection in 4 (2.4%).,no differences were found in the two groups between frequencies of anastomotic dehiscences, intra-abdominal abscesses, sepsis, and pulmonary infections.,the prophylactic regimen significantly reduced the number of urinary tract infections (p less than or equal to 0.0001).,it is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference on the incidence of postoperative wound sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery between the group given doxycycline for five days and the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole for one day.,the abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group a and 9.1 percent in group b (difference not significant).,post-operative peritonitis was not seen.,doxycycline thus was significantly more effective in preventing complications in general, but metronidazole gave superior protection against anaerobes.,non-wound infectious morbidity was 5.8% (p greater than 0.05) for cefoperazone, mostly urinary tract infections causes by escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus spp.,both regimens were acceptable with minimal toxicity.,there was a low incidence (1.3%) of serious postoperative bleeding and no serious adverse reactions were noted.,abdominal pain was recorded in 13%, 10% and 4% of patients (p: 0.077).,there were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients.,patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group a) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group b or group c,no difference in wound infection rates was seen in patients following appendicectomy, biliary or gastro-oesophageal surgery.,a significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis, intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%).,besides those, 26 infections of the urinary tract were observed, which occurred significantly more often after the one-shot dose (40.9%) than with the short-time prophylaxis (18.6%).,surgical infections occurred in 92 (26.4 per cent) of 349 evaluable patients.,infection rates stratified by types of surgery were similar for both regimens.,there was no significant difference in the incidence of operation-related infection, chest or urinary tract infection.,no significant difference was observed concerning local wound infection, septicemia, anastomotic dehiscence or death.,perineal wound sepsis (31 per cent) was significantly more common than abdominal wound sepsis (7 per cent).,there was no significant difference in wound infection rates between the two groups (14.7% for cefotetan and 13.9% for cefuroxime plus metronidazole), or the rates of other infective complications.,there was no difference in the other outcome measures studied which included non-fatal deep sepsis, length of postoperative hospital stay, duration of postoperative fever or the use of antibiotics for postoperative infection.,although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups.,no significant differences were found in the incidence of other major or minor infective or non-infective postoperative complications between the groups.,it is concluded that short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime is as effective as long-term prophylaxis with penicillin and streptomycin.,no significant intergroup difference was found between the respective overall rates of infectious complications (3.2% and 4.9%).,wound infection was related to the amount of perioperative blood loss, duration of the operation, type of operation and drainage in the aminoglycoside group.,a subset analysis of prolonged operations found significantly fewer superficial ssis in the single high dose group than in the multiple standard dose group with rates of 22.2% (6/27) vs. 55% (11/20), respectively (p= 0.021).,this study demonstrated that a single-dose antibiotic regimen was as effective as a multiple-dose regimen in the prophylaxis of wound infections following abdominal surgery.,the time of hospitalization was reduced from 20.3 days (cp) to 16.7 days (co) (p less than 0.05 s).,septic complications remote from the abdominal wound, e.g. intra-abdominal abscesses, occurred in both cefoxitin-treated and placebo-treated patients, but numbers were too small for meaningful analysis.,no septic complications occurred in the 26 patients (0%) receiving metronidazole/fosfomycin (p less than 0.01).,no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 3.1 in group a (1/32) and 0% in group b. urinary tract infections (1 case) and respiratory tract infections (2 cases) were observed only in group b:,the overall infection rate was 17 of 149 evaluable patients (11%), 95% ci 6.8 to 17.7.,orthograde bowel lavage alone proved to be of no effect in reducing the rate of septic complications when used without antibiotic perioperative short-term-prophylaxis and therefore cannot be recommended to be used solely.,patients receiving cefoxitin had a higher wound infection rate than patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (12.5% v 3.2%, respectively, p = .06).,five out of 36 evaluable patients had an infection at the operation site.,because of an unacceptably high rate of surgical infection in all three groups (36%, 29% and 39%, p greater than 0.1) among the first 103 evaluable patients, the study was discontinued.,thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection, 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage.,only one serious, but non-fatal intra-abdominal complication (1.4%) was observed in this group.,no significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected.,wound infection rates, which included minor and delayed infections, were similar in both groups (group p, 57 of 342, 16.7 per cent; group t, 55 of 358, 15.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence intervals for the difference being -4.1 to +6.7 per cent.,nonobese patients and patients whose surgical procedures lasted less than 4 hours treated with either drug had significantly higher success rates (p less than 0.01).,when the four surgical blocks were separately considered, however, the difference between the two regimens was found to be mainly due to rectal operations, following which the incidence of abdominal and of perineal wound infections was significantly lower with the combined regimen than with doxycycline alone.,there were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures studied, the overall abdominal infection rates (wound, deep, and septicaemia) being 4.6% and 7.4%, and the remote infection rates (pneumonia, urinary tract, and central venous line) 15.1% and 12.8%, respectively.,both groups were comparable in sex, age, clinical diagnosis and type of operation performed.,the incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) from 32% in the control group to 10% in the treated group.,addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (p = 0.003).,impairment of cell-mediated immunity was associated with significantly heightened rate of wound infection, and these patients did not benefit from topical antibiotics.,in an open, prospective, and randomized investigation on the prophylactic efficacy of peroral neomycin sulfate-erythromycin base vs intravenous ceftriaxone-metronidazole preparation in colorectal surgery, no significantly diverging results between regimens were recorded (1/27 [3.7%] and 2/27 [7.4%] wound infections, respectively).,wound infection rates were: group 1, 32/453 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 9.4%); group 2, 33/454 (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 4.9% to 9.6%).,the number of each type of septic postoperative complication and their total did not differ between the group treated by oral antibiotics prior to operation and the group treated peroperatively with systemic antibiotic therapy.,there were two episodes of septicaemia, each in the mezlocillin group.,the infection rate was 10% in the "one-dose" treatment group and 10% in the "four-dose" treatment group.,wound infections occurred in 5 patients in the combined group but in 17 in the systemic group (p < 0.01, rr = 0.29, 95% ci 0.11-0.75).,there was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%).,there was no statistically significant difference between both chemoprophylaxis groups (p = 0.10).,a positive wound culture at the end of the operation was more common after colorectal surgery (30,2%) than after biliary surgery (4,6%) and was associated with a higher subsequent infection rate (p = 0,02).,ignoring the treatment group, the median postoperative hospital stay was 17 days (interquartile range 10 days) for infected patients and 11 days (interquartile range 4 days) for those not infected.(abstract truncated at 250 words),two of 27 patients receiving cefoxitin developed wound infections, and one developed an intraabdominal abscess (11%).,when trivial wound infections were disregarded the wound infection rates were 11% and 16% respectively, which again was not statistically significant.,there was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups.,the rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar.,the results show the effectiveness of the association gentamicin-metronidazole (9.4% of infections), compared to the control group with no antibiotics (39.1% of infections), x2 = 14.1; p less than 0.001).,of the 128 evaluable patients, six of the 63 patients (9.5%) in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and seven of the 65 patients (10.7%) in the gentamicin and metronidazole group developed wound infection.,intra-abdominal abscess occurred in 8% of those who received amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with 6% of those given metronidazole plus gentamicin.,the wound infection rate was 10.6 percent in patients receiving timentin and 9.7 percent in those receiving mezlocillin (p greater than .05).,the rates of infective complications were higher in the parenteral than in the combined group, the difference in wound infection rates being statistically significant; the figures were 27.6 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively (p = .04).,analysis of the results showed that the two antibiotics had equivalent prophylactic effectiveness (congruent to 6%) in colorectal surgery.,in the postoperative course 53% (group a) and 67% (group b) of the patients developed bacterial infections.,the frequency of all wound infections (grade i + grade ii) was 8% in the treatment group (25 patients) versus 66.7% in the control group (24 patients).,results in the two different groups were significantly different regarding abdominal abscess and the total infectious episodes in the surgical site with lower frequency in patients receiving both thymostimulin and the antibiotic (cefotetan).,the overall incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications was 7.3% (7 of 96) in the control group (no cefoxitin) and 5% (5 of 101) in the treatment group (cefoxitin).,the overall wound infection was 14.4%, with no difference between erythromycin and metronidazole.,efficacy of prophylaxis in patients was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (abdominal, urinary, respiratory and wound infections).,the results indicate that prophylactic cefotaxime and metronidazole are effective in reducing the incidence of septic complications following colorectal surgery; nevertheless, a study with a larger number of patients is needed to reach a definitive conclusion.,a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (p = 0.03) and blood loss (p < 0.01), while an mrsa infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (p < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (p = 0.07).,the difference in infection rates (2/41 = 5% v. 7/33 = 21%) was statistically significant.,intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group b patients.,there were no significant differences in the infection rates between subgroups.,episodes of sepsis, urinary tract infection and pneumonia were similar in both groups.,wound sepsis was demonstrated in 11.5% of cases of group a and 23.0% of group b (p less than 0.01); another type of sepsis was observed in 34% of group a and 11.5% of group b (p less than 0.001).,there were no significant differences between randomized groups on either preoperative tinidazole or placebo added to pre-, per, and postoperative doxycycline.,the operative site infection rate was 6.5% for cefmetazole and 7.7% for cefoxitin (p greater than 0.05).,no significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%).,co-amoxiclav was given to 230 patients with a total wound infection rate of 5.6% and cefuroxime plus metronidazole were given to 225 patients with a total wound infection rate of 3%.,there was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative sepsis between the two groups (a total of 72 patients).,the reduction in the infection rate in the group treated by cefoxitin was statistically significant (p less than 0.02).,the wound infection rate was 8% in those patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis and 20% in those receiving tinidazole (p less than 0.05).,the rate of postoperative wound infections was not significantly different in the groups (p = 0,09).,patients who received tinidazole and doxycycline had significantly fewer infectious complications, reoperations, additional use of antibiotics, and a shorter hospital stay.,wound infection occurred in five of 81 patients who had topical application of ampicillin compared with six of 89 patients who did not receive prophylaxis; the difference was not significant.,ertapenem is more effective than cefotetan in the prevention of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery but may be associated with an increase in c. difficile infection.,no significant difference in postoperative infections between the two groups could be demonstrated.,no statistically significant between-treatment difference was detected in successful clinical response rates at the end of the study (72% for each group).,other infections were least frequent in group c (four of 29 patients), but were not significantly different to groups b (six of 30) and a (nine of 31).,when sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group, in contaminated operations.,wound infection occurred in 1 case of group a versus 2 cases of group b (p greater than 0.25).,antimicrobial prophylaxis was successful in preventing primary site infections in 92.8% of patients in the cefepime + metronidazole arm and 92.9% of patients in the ceftriaxone + metronidazole arm.,patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated preoperatively with salicylazosulfapyridine run a greater risk of postoperative infection in spite of the prophylaxis.,no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 9% in group a and 16% in group b. infections not of surgical origin were found only in group b (10.4%).,the resulting difference between the overall septic complication rate in patients receiving erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin (10.9 percent) and the rate in patients receiving metronidazole alone (31.9 percent) was significant.,most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time, estimated by the kaplan-meier method).,no differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections.,although no serious infections were observed in either group, the incidence of superficial wound infections was relatively high: 19% in the group with metronidazole and gentamicin prophylaxis and 25% in the other group.,in the cefotaxime group 22 of the 241 patients who had an anastomosis developed leaks (9%) compared with 8 of the 239 in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group (3%).,the overall postoperative infection rate was 19.6% with no statistically significant difference between the two groups.,the concentrations after administration of 2 g cefotiam were higher, as expected, and without any adverse side effects.,the wound infection rate was 37% (10 patients) in group,the proportion of patients with wound infections and other infective complications was significantly less (p < 0.02) in those receiving oral ciprofloxacin.,the wound infection rate was 2.4 percent in the patients receiving timentin and 14 percent in those receiving tinidazole (p = 0.01).,there was no significant difference in septic complication or mortality rates following short-term vs. long-term prophylaxis.,no complications were observed from either the 10% mannitol solution or the intravenous flagyl at either clinical, hematologic, or biochemical assessment.,the data obtained demonstrated that the reduced infection rate was not the result of a reduction in the bacterial content of the colon alone but due to the prophylactic agents used for elective colon surgery.,monitoring of operative and postoperative bleeding revealed no evidence (except in one doubtful case) of excessive bleeding associated with the use of a single dose of latamoxef.,among 224 evaluable cases, the timentin associated wound infection rate (0.7%), nonwound infectious morbidity (8.8%), adverse reactions (1.9%), and total costs ($14.15) were not statistically different than that of the control drug.,the frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens.,two wound infections occurred in patients receiving e-m, neither due to anaerobic bacteria, but seven wound infections developed in patients given n-e (p = 0.057), five of them caused by anaerobic bacteria.,no anaerobic pathogens were detected in any of the cases.,most postoperative infections were superficial wound infections (14 of 24 patients), and the mean hospital stay in the two treatment groups was equal.,bacteriologic examination of the anastomoses, abdominal walls, and wounds showed significantly more sterile cultures in the combination group, although more aerobic cefuroxime-resistant isolates were seen in this group.,a significant excess of wound sepsis in the aztreonam group was seen (23/71 vs 9/70 chi 2 6.60; p less than 0.01).,intra-abdominal infections were more frequent in the clindamycin + gentamicin arm of the study (fisher's exact test, p = 0.035).

smoking,knowledge of ets effects,self reported 24 h point prevalence quit rate and self-reported continuous quit rate and bio-chemically validated quit rate|however, counselling led to no differences in parental smoking between the two groups, or in exposure of the intervention and control children to tobacco smoke.,in 1984, when the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 61% among men and 7% among women, approximately 250 million persons in prc smoked tobacco products (1).,a brief intervention to advise parents of asthmatic children about the risks from passive smoking was ineffective in reducing their children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke.,the intervention did not change parents' propensity to create or maintain bans on smoking in their homes or otherwise change smoking habits to reduce their children's exposure to ets.,enrolling mothers and fathers into tobacco treatment services during the immediate postpartum hospital stay is feasible and seems to stimulate quit attempts.,confronting mothers with their initial concentrations of cotinine was not found to be an additional factor reducing tobacco consumption.,more treatment (35%) than control (17%) subjects reported smoking outside their homes at posttest (and their children's cotinine levels were lower), but this difference was not statistically significant.,baseline comparison showed no significant differences between the two groups in the mothers' actions to protect the children from passive smoking exposure.,significant or near significant time main effects were seen for children's hair cotinine, per cent confirmed reducers, and, in particular, parent reports of exposure.,the absolute risk reduction was 7.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.78% to 12.01%).,there was no impact of group assignment on the quit rate, cigarettes/day, or stage of change.,the mean log ratio of the follow-up to initial urine cotinine measurements was 6% lower in the intervention group than in the control group.,asthma symptom days declined more in the high-intensity group, although the across-group difference did not reach statistical significance (p=.138).,the prevalence of persistent lower respiratory symptoms was lower among intervention-group infants of smoking mothers whose head of household had no education beyond high school: intervention group, 14.6%; and controls, 34.0%.,there were no differences between the groups in the exposure of infants to tobacco smoke.,at 12 and 18 months, there was little impact for either intervention on the main outcomes: child injury (shv: relative risk 0.99; 95% confidence intervals 0.68 to 1.45, cgs: 0.91; 0.61 to1.36), maternal smoking (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to 1.19, cgs: 0.97; 0.72 to 1.33) or maternal depression (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to1.19, cgs: 0.93; 0.69 to 1.27).,we found no significant differences between the groups with respect to change in smoking behaviour.,children's urinary cotinine concentrations did not show significant change over time in either group.,no significant differences in total and specific immunoglobulin e were found between the groups.,there were no significant differences between subjects in the three groups in use of the self-help guides, methods used to attempt quitting, and quitting behavior.,the 6-month nicotine levels were significantly lower in mi households.,after 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, p = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the asthma management.,provision to mothers of both groups of health risks of tobacco smoke resulted in significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the control group, with child intervention group having significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the maternal intervention group (p < 0.05).,significantly greater change occurred in the counseling group than the control groups and was sustained throughout the 2 years of follow-up.,the quit rate at 1 month was 7.5% (95% ci, 0-21) in the intervention group and 2.5% (95% ci, 0-7) in the control group.,the intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect.,cotinine prevalence decreased from 54% to 40% among coached families, while it increased from 43% to 49% among controls.,school intervention condition was not a factor in the prediction of experimentation.,at both follow-ups, abstinence rates were twice as great in the intervention group as in the control group (7.7% vs 3.4% and 13.5% vs 6.9%, respectively).,the effect was stronger in mothers and in higher social groups.,in particular, significant and positive differences were found in parenting with the intervention group feeling less restrictions imposed by the parenting role, greater sense of competence in parenting, greater acceptability of the child, and the child being more likely to provide positive reinforcement to the parent.,at 12 months the cotinine concentration in the counselled group was 55.6% (48.2% to 63.0%) that of controls.,after the intervention, cotinine levels were reduced in the intervention group (165 ng/ml) and increased in the control group (346 ng/ml).

weeks.,there were no complications of laparoscopy.,there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the appearance of the appendix.,the laparoscopic group had a significant reduced postoperative narcotic requirement (p<0.05), quicker reintroduction of diet and quicker return to normal activity.,the relative risk of removing a healthy appendix in open surgery was 6.6 relative risk (range, 2-21 c.i.) as compared with laparoscopy.,laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform than open appendectomy (median, 107 vs 91 minutes; p <.01) and was associated with fewer days to return to a general diet (mean, 1.6 versus 2.3 days; p <.01), a shorter duration of parenteral analgesia (mean, 1.6 versus 2.2 days; p <.01), fewer morphine-equivalent milligrams of parenteral

laparoscopic group had a longer median operating time (63 minutes versus 40 minutes), fewer wound infections (2% versus 11%), less requirement for narcotic analgesia, and an earlier return to normal activity (median 7 days versus 14 days).,laparoscopy was associated with no added complications, no increase in hospital stay in patients who went on to appendicectomy, and a reduction in hospital stay for those who underwent laparoscopy alone.,when the groups were compared according to the subgroups of gastro-intestinal quality of life index, except for disease-specific items, in all categories a significant improvement was seen in the laparoscopically treated patients.,there was no significant difference in duration of sick leave after operation (laparoscopic group 11 days versus

and 2nd (p < 0.001) postoperative day, resulting in less use of analgesics on both days (p < 0.001).,laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform without affecting significantly the needs for postoperative analgesia, the duration of hospital stay and the time to return to normal activities when compared with open appendectomy in men.,there was no significant difference in postoperative pain or fatigue, but return to normal life was faster in the la group (14 versus 26. 5 days).,there was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity rate in the two groups.,we found that la is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer postoperative complications, and better diagnostic accuracy, and it is recommended as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis.,length of stay averaged 21.5 h for the laparoscopic group and was not statistically different when compared to the open group.,there was no difference between groups for demographic data (particularly macroscopic aspect of appendix) analgesia, sedation, delay before eating and walking, incidence of urinary retention, nausea, vomiting.,though laparoscopic appendectomy started endoscopic surgery in general surgery, it has yet not reached the acceptance as is the case with cholecystectomy.,the complication rate after open appendectomy (25.8%) was not significantly different from that after laparoscopic appendectomy (12.1%).,this occurred at an average of 25 days for the open appendectomy group versus 14 days for the laparoscopic appendectomy group (p < 0.001).,the mean hospital stay for la was 3.23 days compared with 3.03 days for oa (p < 0.001).,la is a more expensive alternative and offers no advantages related to pain relief, length of stay, return to normal activities, or morbidity.,no positive blood cultures were demonstrated in the open operated group.,laparoscopy was associated with fewer wound infections (p < 0.03) and improved cosmesis (p < 0.001), but the operating time was longer (60 versus 40 min).,in young women with right lower abdominal pain, laparoscopy can give precise diagnosis and reduce the rate of negative appendectomies.,the data from this prospective, randomized, double-blind study failed to demonstrate any significant reduction in lost workdays, postoperative pain, or operative time with laparoscopic appendectomy.,there were no statistically significant differences between the la and oa groups in operative risk: mean age, 28 +/-,laparoscopic appendectomy does not offer any proved benefits compared with the open approach for the routine patient with acute appendicitis.,laparoscopic appendectomy has no advantages in terms of convalescence and time to return to work when compared to open appendectomy and should therefore be limited to selected cases.,laparoscopic appendectomy is comparable to open appendectomy with regard to complications, hospital stay, cost, return to activity, and return to work.,laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anesthetic time (72.5 minutes versus 55 minutes) and actual operating time (45 minutes versus 25 minutes) compared with open appendectomy.,excess operating and complication costs per procedure were 96 euros (eur) in laparoscopic appendectomy.,there were no differences in hospital stay or the postoperative course of the patients.,despite an increasing metabolic acidosis, prolonged carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum resulted in only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentrations, which was both statistically and clinically insignificant.,laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anaesthetic time (78 minutes versus 51) and operating time (49 minutes versus 23) compared with open appendectomy.,the risk of unnecessary appendicectomy was significantly (p = 0.03) lower after laparoscopy.,laparoscopic appendicectomy has higher direct costs than open operation and is not as cost-effective when the longterm outcome is the same in both groups.,the outcome following laparoscopic appendicectomy for confirmed acute appendicitis is at least equivalent to that achieved with conventional appendicectomy.,average postoperative length of stay without any complications was 6.2 +/-2.5 days in the open group and 4.3 +/-,the operative time in la group was significantly (p < 0.001) longer (87.2 minutes) than for oa group (65.2 minutes).,the operating time seemed to be shorter for the oa patients than for the la patients, but the difference was not significant (la, 30 +/-,there were five (9 per cent) wound infections after open appendicectomy compared with none after the laparoscopic operation (p < 0.01).,wound infection incidence was lower in the laparoscopic group.

a combination of pefloxacin with vancomycin regarding gram-positive (gram+) infections and infections with gram-negative (gram-) organisms usually resistant to pefloxacin.,there was no statistical difference in the occurrence of documented septicemia, documented coccus gram-positive infections, or fever of unknown origins during aplasia in the 2 groups.,norfloxacin was better tolerated (30 of 36 versus 16 of 30 patients highly compliant, p = 0.02), and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (eight of 36 versus 14 of 36 patients, p = 0.07).,no side effects that related to ofloxacin were noted.,there was no significant difference in the occurrence of febrile days, febrile episodes, the duration of antibiotic treatment, the number of sepsis in two groups.,no infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were seen in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.02).,the compliance was better in group i but the treatment had to be modified in 9 patients of group i because of liver abnormalities.(abstract truncated at 250 words),20% of the treated subjects versus 68.6% of the controls presented a subsequent infection (p less than 0.001), the lung representing the most frequent site of the infectious disease in both groups (3/6 and 14/24 respectively).,the incidence of infection was higher in the trimethoprim group (50 percent) than in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (39 percent), but this did not reach statistical significance.,there were significantly fewer overall infections (10 versus 3; p = 0.016) and streptococcal infections (9 versus 1; p = 0.0078) in the group receiving gram-positive prophylaxis.,bacteraemia due to resistant gram-negative rods occurred only in the co-trimoxazole-colistin group though both regimens were effective for selective gastrointestinal tract decontamination.,clinically, the prophylactic efficacy was 92% for the oflx regimen and 40% for the control regimen (p less than 0.01).,prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin reduced the incidence of neutropenic fever in patients receiving hdt with asct, however, without affecting the total interval of hospitalization, time to engraftment, or all-cause mortality.,ofloxacin was significantly better tolerated than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and shortened the duration of fever (p = 0.02) and of parenteral antimicrobial therapy for presumed or documented acquired infection (p = 0.01).,however, c + r combination prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of gram-positive bacteremia (five versus zero episodes) but was associated with a higher incidence of drug-related side effects.,prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones reduced the occurrence of infection in adult neutropenic patients without affecting the long-term survival.,gram-positive and gram-negative infections were significantly less frequent in patients receiving pv, because of fewer infections with staphylococcus species and enterobacteriaceae.,the addition of vancomycin resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of patients with surveillance cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (stool cultures, 44 versus 23%; throat swab cultures, 37 versus 19%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (throat swab cultures, 90 versus 60%).,fever or infection (without fever) developed in 190 (71%) of 268 evaluable patients in the penicillin arm compared with 213 (80%) of 268 evaluable patients in the placebo arm (p = .03; 95% confidence interval [ci] for the difference, -16% to -1%).,the incidence of febrile days and of days on parenteral antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in the group given tmp-smz and colistin (p less than 0.05).,gram-positive cocci were isolated less frequently from tmp-smz-treated, bacteremic patients, but more of their isolates were resistant to tmp-smz than were those from placebo recipients.,four significant differences were observed between the group given tmp/stx (30 patients) and the control group (33 patients): 1) the mean duration of severe granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 500 pmn/mm3) before the first febrile episode was longer in prophylaxis group, 14.26 days versus four in the control group (p less than 0.001); 2) the number of febrile episodes was 37 in tmp/stx group and 69 in control group (p less than 0.01); 3) 23 patients on prophylaxis presented at least one febrile episode versus 33 in the control group (p less than 0.01); 4) deaths due to infection were two in the tmp/stx group versus 11 in control group (p less than 0.05).,fifteen patients in the control group developed febrile neutropenia versus 12 of those in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.69).,there were no differences in the incidence of gram-positive infections nor in the length of hospitalization between the two treatment arms.,no significant differences in survival, frequency of bacteremia, overall infections, use of systemic antimicrobial therapy, or adverse effects, including myelosuppression, were observed between patients receiving tmp-smz vs. those receiving placebo.,although there was a trend toward a reduction in the overall incidence of bacteremia (12 v 4 patients), and gram-positive bacteremia (8 v 2 patients) with the addition of rifampin, none of these comparisons was statistically significant (p =.05 and p =.09, respectively).,the death rate from infection was significantly reduced in patients who received antibiotics for gut flora suppression in conventional ward isolation compared with the corresponding control group.,trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in fewer microbiologically documented infections (seven versus 15; p = 0.029).,no statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms with respect to the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes as defined for this trial (79% for the norfloxacin group, 82% for the ofloxacin group, and 77% for the ofloxacin plus rifampin group).,group d streptococcus species were poorly suppressed by gn compared with gvn, although no patient developed an infection with these organisms.,although there was no difference between the two arms in the proportion of patients developing fever or in the median number of days of fever, the time to onset of fever was a mean of 1 day longer in each patient on the pre-emptive arm (log rank p<0.001).,both drugs showed an effective elimination of gram-negative potential pathogens and staphylococcus aureus not affecting the anaerobic flora of the gastrointestinal tract.,norfloxacin was more effective than cotrimoxazole for preventing acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in surveillance cultures.,only one infection caused by gram-negative bacilli was observed in the pefloxacin group compared with seven in the norfloxacin group (p = 0.019).,there were no differences between the two groups in age (mean 33 years, range 11-54), sex, diagnosis and mean duration of agranulocytosis (21.8 days, range 10-49).,ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin.,with regard to the side effects, there was no significant difference in the two groups.,the percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1, 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (p less than 0.01).,eleven of 16 microbiologically documented infections in the tmp/smx group and 7 of 11 in the nor group were caused by gram negative bacilli (gnb).,the use of quinolones was associated with a delay in the fever onset during neutropenia (p = 0.0448), a decrease in the proportion of neutropenic febrile days (p = 0.0456), a decrease of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli (p = 0.037) and an increase of streptococcus infections (p = 0.0857).,both treatment groups acquired yeasts.,significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (p less than 0.05).,vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (p less than .002).,the incidences of superficial skin and overall infections were significantly lower in those patients with multiple relapses who received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.008); however, there was no difference between the groups in regard to days of fever, days of antibiotic administration, days of hospitalization, or gram-negative rod bacteremia.,side effects were not significantly different, but compliance with ciprofloxacin was better.,a decrease in the total number of acquired infections was found (16 infections in the group given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus 31 in the control group, p less than 0.01).,no differences were noted between the two groups with respect to secondary outcome measures, including time to endpoint, occurrence of fever, type and number of microbiologically documented infections, and administration of intravenous antibiotics.,a decrease in the number of major acquired infections was observed: three infections occurred in 16 patients receiving the sam regimen compared with eight infections in 17 patients given the placebo.,prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated way of preventing febrile episodes and other relevant infection-related outcomes in patients with cancer and profound and protracted neutropenia.,patients in group a had significantly more episodes of afebrile aplasia (34.5% vs 4%) and less bacteriemias (10% vs 48%) than those in group b. also fever developed later in group a (mean: 12.5 vs 6 days).,the laf plus a patients had a significantly decreased incidence of total infection, bacteremias, pneumonias, rectal abscesses, urinary tract infection, and pharyngitis.,patients with initial leukopenia of grade who iii-i had only a 11% infection rate showing no significant difference between the treatment groups.,trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be easily taken, to suppress the enterobacteriaceae, and to maintain the anaerobic rectal flora for biological stability of the rectal ecosystem.,incidence of infection at less than 100 granulocytes/microliters was significantly reduced in the tmp/smz group (2 infections/100 days) compared to placebo (11 infections/100 days, p = 0.005).,infections due to gram negative bacteria decreased to 33.3% in the ap group (vs. 92% in the control group), but infections due to gram positive bacteria increased to 66.7% (vs. 8% in the control group).,prophylaxis was continued until the neutropenia resolved (granulocytes greater than 0.5.10(9)/l) or until the onset of infectious symptoms.,only two gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in the cip + col arm compared with 16 in the neo + col arm.,there was no difference in the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease or incidence and duration of fever.,in conclusion, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in prevention of gram-positive bacteremias.,patients receiving ciprofloxacin also had fewer days of fever (average 6.5 days versus 9.8 days for the polymyxin b group, p less than 0.02).,the number of days with fever > 38.5 degrees c was significantly higher in the control (vanco-) group than in the vanco+ group (7.4 vs. 3.7, p < 0.02).,st + cpfx was significantly effective than st alone (p < 0.005).,tms prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of c difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia.,the incidence of fever was not significantly different between episodes treated with tmz-e (18/27) and those treated with p (17/29), nor was there a significant difference in the median interval between the onset of neutropenia and the onset of fever.,among patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma, the prophylactic use of levofloxacin reduces the incidence of fever, probable infection, and hospitalization.,ciprofloxacin recipients required fewer days of therapeutic antimicrobials (median: 28 antibiotic-days vs. 49, p0.02).,this benefit was also associated with a 30% increase in the probability of failure-free survival at day 15 (p = 0.138).,three significant differences were observed between the co-trmoxazole and the control groups: (i) 15 of the 16 (94%) control patients but only 8 of the 14 (57%) patients on co-trimoxazole developed infections and required additional antibiotics intravenously; (ii) although the duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.1 times 10(9)/1) was similar in the two groups, control patients required intravenous antibiotics on average after 2 days of neutropenia, whereas patients receiving co-trimoxazole required these only after 12 days; and (iii) the only 2 patients who died of infection were in the control group.,furthermore, side effects were fewer and compliance was better with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin.,levofloxacin reduced the bacterial infections and delays the onset of fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia especially in short duration (< 7 days).,duration of more than a 39 degrees c fever was much longer in the nystatin group than in the norfloxacin group: bacteremia, microbiologically documented infections, and fever of unknown origin were more frequently seen in the nystatin group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups.,adverse events possibly related to the study drugs were slightly more common among the patients receiving the combination treatment (p = 0.05).,both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and ketoconazole substantially reduced the overall incidence of infection consequent to a marked decrease in bacterial infection.,the use of therapeutic antibiotics was reduced (p = 0.013; 1-sided), with less hospitalizations due to fl (31 vs. 17 patients, p = 0.013: 1-sided).,the number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001).,children receiving tmp-smx had fewer episodes of bacteremia (0 vs. 5) and otitis media (3 vs. 18).,this new combination antimicrobial regimen is safe and effective for prevention of gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia being treated with cytotoxic remission-induction chemotherapy.,there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the time before the onset of the first fever, the number of episodes of fever or of septicaemia per patient, the number of neutropenic days during which patients remained afebrile or did not require systemic antibiotics, or the number of resistant organisms acquired.,both aerobic gram-negative rods and streptococci which caused infection despite cotrimoxazole prophylaxis were resistant to cotrimoxazole.,although the frequency of oral thrush was greater (p = .02) in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (25.6%) than in the placebo group (6.3%), invasive fungal infection did not occur.,ciprofloxacin was therefore superior to the other two fluoroquinolones in preventing infections due to gram-negative bacteria in this population of neutropenic patients.,adverse reactions associated with co-trimoxazole/colistin required discontinuation of medication in 11/27 treatment courses because of compliance problems, skin reactions or gastrointestinal intolerance.,prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not significantly reduce the incidence of fever,

p = 0.756 vs. pcc at 12 months).,compared with the standard intervention, fewer men assigned to the enhanced intervention reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a negative or unknown-serostatus partner at 3 months (21 versus 26%, p < 0.05).,at the time of this writing, no randomized controlled trial (rct) of an intervention to reduce unsafe sex among latino gay and bisexual men (lgbm) had been published.,although levels of risk within each wave were never significantly different between the two treatment groups, reductions in unprotected anal intercourse (uai) with a nonmonogamous partner for both groups from the baseline wave-1 levels were uniformly significant (all p's < .05).,a novel counseling intervention focusing on self-justifications significantly decreased the proportion of participants reporting uai with nonprimary partners of unknown or discordant hiv status at 6 and 12 months (from 66% to 21% at 6 months and to 26% at 12 months, p =.002; p <.001) as compared with a control group when added to standard client-centered hiv counseling and testing.,at eight weeks, those attending the group reported significant gains over their control in making sexual choices, physical safety, hiv and sti transmission knowledge, and sexual negotiation skills.,among participants who had two or more sex partners at baseline, uav was reduced 38% (p < 0.001) among those who received the loss-frame intervention.,population-level of risk behaviour decreased significantly in the intervention cities compared with the control cities at 1-year follow-up, after exclusion of surveys completed by transients and men with exclusive sexual partners in a city-level analysis, in the intervention cities we found a reduction in the mean frequency of unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 2 months (baseline 1.68 occasions; follow-up 0.59: p = 0.04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44.7%; follow-up 66.8%, p = 0.02).,the intervention to reduce risk of hiv transmission resulted in significantly less unprotected intercourse and greater condom use at follow-up.,in the post-intervention period, the 3 groups did not differ in the incidence of sexual activity or in the proportion who slipped up at least once, but the self-justifications group were less likely to have had multiple slip-ups.,after 4 weeks, they were allocated to one of 3 conditions: specific encounter (detailed reconstruction of a slip-up, but without any questions about self-justifications); posters (examination of posters, specially designed for the study, that focused on self-justifications); and control (no intervention).,at the community level, movement toward consistent condom use with main (p < .05) and nonmain (p < .05) partners, as well as increased condom carrying (p < .0001), was greater in intervention than in comparison communities.,cognitive behavioral intervention programs can effectively reduce the potential of hiv transmission to others among plh who report significant transmission risk behavior.,this behavioural intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver, but it did not reduce the risk of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection among these gay men at high risk.

cohen's d=0.05); greater reductions in waist circumference (-1.65 cm [-4.67, 1.36]; d=0.15); percentage body fat (-1.69% [-4.98, 1.60]; d=0.22) and time spent in small screen recreation on weekends (-1.13 h [-5.06, 2.80]; d=0.19); and a greater increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (2.13 laps [6.22, 10.48]; d=0.16); and participation in total weekday physical activity (140.74 counts/min [-159.44, 440.92]; d=0.36).,a statistically significant decrease in the daily consumption of carbonated drinks in the intervention compared to control (mean difference =,girls in the exercise group had a lower likelihood of having an increasing bmi slope than the control girls did (odds ratio: 0.32; 95% ci: 0.18, 0.56).,each field center developed its own intervention(s) and corresponding control, and tailored its study to the specific hypothesis being tested.,however, for the majority of outcome variables, differences between intervention and control schools at postintervention and follow-up were not statistically significant.,significant improvements in nutrition knowledge were seen in all children (p<0.01) between baseline and post-intervention, and results were highly significant in the nutrition and combined group (p<0.001).,girls in control schools had significant increases in percentage of risk of overweight or overweight from third (26%) to fifth (39%) grades, as did girls in catch schools (30%-32%); however, the rate of increase for girls in the catch schools was significantly lower (2%) compared with the rate for control girls (13%).,results showed significant differences between the treatment and control mothers for daily saturated fat intake and percentage of calories from fat.,after two years, there was a trend for the children exposed to the pe intervention to have lower levels of body fat, but the differences were not significant.,overall results at the end of the 12-week program demonstrated substantial, although not significant, differences between treatment and control groups in the hypothesized directions.,the effect sizes of the differences between treatment and control groups ranged between small (cohen's d = 0.15 for body mass index at 6 months post-intervention) to large (1.38; parent report of screen time at 6 months post-intervention), controlling for baseline levels.,the group by time interactions were significant for fitness (p < 0.01) and %bf (p < 0.05).,total energy intake (by 24-h dietary recall) was significantly reduced in the intervention schools but energy intake (by direct observation) was not.,schools with > or =75 min of physical activity across the curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in body mass index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of physical activity across the curriculum,parental involvement did not increase intervention effects.,in a 2-y intervention targeting increased physical activity and healthy eating in primary school children, the adjusted body mass index (bmi) z score was 0.26 units (95% ci: 0.21, 0.32) lower in intervention than in control children.,eating habits at home were found to be healthier among families with children in intervention schools at the end of the intervention.,positive effect on adiposity indices (except tsf) was observed in boys (p<0.001 for bmi z), while both physical fitness parameters increased significantly in both boys (p<0.001 for each test) and girls (p<0.0001 for each test).,compared with controls, participants in the intervention groups achieved their nutritional targets for fat intake and to a smaller extent for sugar and complex carbohydrate intake, leading to a decrease in energy intake (children, p < .001; parents, p = .02).,no differences in self-reported pa emerged between the intervention and control groups at weeks 1 (baseline) and 12 (postintervention).,a multicomponent school-based intervention can be effective in preventing the development of overweight among children in grades 4 through 6 in urban public schools with a high proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-priced school meals.,interventions aimed to improve health-related behaviours had significant effects on the age-dependent increases in median triceps skinfolds of the whole group (from 10.9 to 11.3 mm in "intervention schools" vs from 10.7 to 13.0 mm in "control schools", p<0.01) as well as in percentage fat mass of overweight children (increase by 3.6 vs 0.4% per year without and with intervention, respectively; p<0.05).,multilevel analyses showed that the intervention remained effective in preventing unfavorable increases in important measures of body composition after 20-month follow-up in girls (biceps skinfold and sum of 4 skinfolds) and boys (triceps, biceps, and subscapular skinfolds).,intervention children showed a higher score for knowledge, attitudes, and self reported behaviour for healthy eating and physical activity.,at follow-up, 45% of girls in the intervention schools and 36% of girls in the control schools reported vigorous physical activity during an average of 1 or more 30-minute time blocks per day over a 3-day period.,intervention children had significantly smaller increases in bmi compared with control children at 1-year follow-up, 0.06 vs 0.59 kg/m 2 ; difference -0.53 kg/m 2,after intervention, prevalence of overweight, bmi z-score and change in bmi z-score were significantly lower in intervention groups compared with controls in underprivileged areas.,scores on the restriction subscale of the child feeding questionnaire decreased significantly in the opps condition (-0.22+/- 0.42 vs. 0.08+/- 0.63, p < 0.05), indicating that mothers in the opps group were engaging in less restrictive child feeding practices over time.,consumption of ssbs decreased by 82% in the intervention group and did not change in the control group.,following the program champion-directed intervention, girls in intervention schools were more physically active than girls in control schools (mean difference 10.9 met-weighted minutes of mvpa, 95% ci=0.52-21.2).,children from intervention schools spent less time on screen-viewing activities after the intervention but these differences were imprecisely estimated: mean difference in minutes spent on screen viewing at the end of the intervention (intervention schools minus control schools) adjusted for baseline levels and clustering within schools was -11.6,cross-sectional comparisons at baseline indicated lower physical activity, self-efficacy for physical activity and aerobic fitness and a higher bmi in children with high screen time.,int children had a 20% greater increase in fitness and a 5.7% smaller increase in bp compared with children attending up schools (p<0.05).,in addition, girls in the active intervention groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages by 34%, increased their level of moderate-to-vigorous activity by 12%, and increased their serving; of water by 1.5%.,parents in the increased fruit and vegetable group showed significantly greater decreases in percentage of overweight than parents in the decreased high-fat/high-sugar group.,no changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure were associated with the intervention in either sex, except for an increase in diastolic blood pressure (1.55 mm hg; 95% ci 0.19-2.91; p=0.03) in the intervention versus control boys.,the diminution of insulin levels was more significant in the overweight group (p < 0.007).,children playing kalèdo showed a significant increase in nutrition knowledge (p<0.05) and in weekly vegetable intake (p<0.01) with respect to the control.,percentage of adolescents meeting recommended health guidelines was significantly improved for girls for consumption of saturated fat (intervention vs control change, 23.4% to 41.0% vs 18.5% to 31%, respectively [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.68]) and for boys' participation in d/wk of pa (intervention vs control change, 45.3% to 55.4% vs 41.9% to 38.0%, respectively [relative risk, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.75]).,group allocation had no significant effect on the primary outcome measure at six and 12 months or on measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour by accelerometry.,the treatment group reported significantly reduced household television viewing (d = .73, p = .007) and fewer dinners eaten while watching tv (adjusted difference = -1.60 meals/week, 95% ci -2.99, -.21; d = .59; p = .03).,analysis of post-data shows significant positive shifts (p = 0.01) in bmi in the intervention group compared with the comparison group.,the percentage of children watching television/videos more than 2 h/d also decreased significantly from 33% to 18% among the intervention group, compared with an increase of 41% to 47% among the control group, for a difference of -21.5% (95% confidence interval, -42.5% to -0.5%; p =.046).,intervention students had a lower increase in bmi (p=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted bmi (p<0.02) over time than controls.,no significant differences between groups were found for bmi.,the intervention group significantly (p = 0.013) reduced its intake of artificial juice, which is prohibited by the act.,the intervention had positive, significant effects on percentage bmi-for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight, bmi, and percentage body fat for parents.,this study population stabilized their bmi sds (p < 0.025).,in contrast, in boys only bmi z-score (p < 0.001) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001) were affected.,there were no significant differences between intervention and control schools in either primary or secondary outcomes at post-intervention, year 1, or year 2 follow-ups.,children in the bm/fms group were less likely than controls to be overweight/obese between baseline and post intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aor)=0.36, p<0.05); also maintained at 12-month follow-up (aor=0.38, p<0.05).,building community capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity appears to be a safe and effective way to reduce unhealthy weight gain in children without increasing health inequalities.

asthma.,with the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the mdi-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or fev1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by mdi-spacer.,no significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered.,the baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different.,the 6-h area under the curve fev1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered.,there was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma.,large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe.,pefr increased significantly in both the groups after completion of treatment, but pefr was not statistically significant when compared in between groups.,during the asthma attacks, the odn group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000).,the cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001).,mdi-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children.,albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma.,the improvement from baseline at 30 min in the clinical score was 1.87 for jn and 1.43 for pmdi (p=0.09) and at 60 min was 2.15 for jn and 1.12 for pmdi (p=0.0001).,additionally, the neb group presented a higher incidence of tremor (p=.03) and anxiety (p=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol.,there was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group.,there were no differences between groups in the score over time, or secondary outcome measures.,less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure).,no difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment.,both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both fvc and fev1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment.,all three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted pefr.,fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ed (9% vs 20%, p < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, p < .001).,the mean percentage of improvement in fvc and fev1 in the a group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively.,no significant difference in bronchodilation was seen between groups a and b. fenoterol through a spacer can replace inhalation in adult asthma patients with non-severe obstruction.

than the experimental group.,the intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes (6 versus 29%, or 0.17 95% ci 0.03-0.95, p = 0.04).,however, insulin resistance (homa-ir) did not differ between the groups.,average gestational weight gain was 14.02, 15.27 and 16.22 kg in the three ep, epp and comparison groups respectively, and average weight retention at six months post partum was 2.34, 4.06 and 5.08 kg in the three groups, respectively.,the mean diet gi fell significantly in the lgi group but not in the hgi group.,significant differences (p = .03) were found between study groups in the percentage of women who perceived their health status as "very good"; the values that corresponded to the exercise group (n = 18; 54.5%) were better than those of the control group (n = 9; 27.3%).,the values of the ogtt during the second trimester did not differ between the lifestyle intervention and close follow-up groups.,energy restriction did not alter the frequency of insulin therapy (17.5% in the intervention group and 16.9% in the control group).,the intervention significantly decreased the percentage of normal-weight women who exceeded the iom recommendations (33 vs 58%, p<0.05).,regular weight measurement in pregnancy was not found to be effective in reducing weight gain, except among women who were overweight but not obese before
