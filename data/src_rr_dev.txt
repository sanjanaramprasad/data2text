a quit attempt (44.9% versus 36.5%) and actually quit smoking than in the control group (16.0% versus 8.8%). no significant differences were found in the three measures used to determine outcome--desire to stop smoking, an attempt to stop and success in stopping--between the control and intervention groups. intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (p less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. the prevalence of both pregnant and non-pregnant women who stopped smoking was higher in the intervention than in the control groups. at the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. none of the interventions had any effect on point prevalence of quitting as determined 8-9 months later by self-report. both pi and pi/m proved to be superior to usual care in motivating attempts to quit at both one-month and six-month follow-ups, and logistic regression analyses indicated that participants receiving the self-help manual in addition to the health provider message were between two and three times more likely to quit smoking during the study period than were participants in either of the other study groups. such small improvements in success rates are worth while, especially if they can be achieved cheaply and on a wide scale. at one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. the 95% confidence interval on the difference between the groups was 2.8% in favor of the brief intervention group to 7.3% in favor of the group offered follow-up. using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (or) = thirty five patients in the treatment group were abstinent at three years compared with eight in the control group (p less than 0.001). there was a small but significant reduction of breath co in the patients seen at home by the health visitor but the urinary cotinine concentrations were unchanged. the intervention group also showed some improvements in a standardized measure of breathlessness. in no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (p less than 0.05) level. the intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. negative binomial regression analysis revealed that the number of interventions provided was higher in practices allocated to the tailored letter and combination intervention groups by 215% (p<.01) and 127% (p=.02), respectively, compared to the brief advice intervention group. the prevalence of smokers did not differ significantly at baseline (32.9% and 32.4%, p=0.75). at one-year follow-up, 7.5% of smokers in the minimal advice group who had quit for six or more months remained non-smokers compared with 3.2% in the control group. intervention patients were 1.77 (ci 0.94, 3.34,p = 0.078) times more likely than controls to be abstinent (12 versus 8%), a difference that approached, but did not reach statistical significance, and surpassed controls on number of days quit (18.4 versus 12.2, p < .05) but not on number of quit attempts. the ncg group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). outpatient medical practices assigned to the immediate intervention (experimental) condition were trained to deliver brief quit-smoking advice and counseling. after one year 72% of smokers replied to a postal follow up questionnaire: 11% of the control group claimed to have stopped smoking compared with 15% in the group that received advice alone, 17% in the exhaled carbon monoxide group, and 13% in the health visitor group. the results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (p less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (p less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. a multivariate analysis of smoking cessation showed that lower nicotine dependency, strong determination for smoking cessation, and being female were significant factors for abstinence at the 6-month follow-up. there were no evident effects on blood pressure levels, nor on electrocardiographic findings over three years, nor on sickness absence over one year. the intervention did not have a direct effect on quit rates; however, structural equation modeling supported the self-determination process model of smoking cessation. prolonged abstinence rates among abnormal pft subjects (3.7%) did not differ from those of normals (5.9%). among the 208 smokers in the intervention group there were more attempts to quit, and they were more successful than in the 216 smokers in the control group. this study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. significant differences between controls and the structured behavioural change group were found at the one month follow up, but only for self reported abstinence. at 12-month follow-up, self-reported abstinence rates (including nonrespondents as smokers) differed significantly between intervention subjects and controls: 13.4 vs 7.3% point prevalence (odds ratio 1.51, p < 0.05). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> general practice in italy dutch

use. homosexuals were more likely to be admitted to dedicated aids units, which largely explains the under-representation of minorities and women. the study's principal finding was that specific ancillary services were significantly associated with an increase in an individual's likelihood of entering medical care and maintaining appropriate medical care services for hiv, particularly when the services addressed a corresponding need. hospital admissions were fewer (aids patients, rr = 0.67; hiv-positive patients without aids, rr = 0.45), and length of stay was briefer, compared with patients at the other kaiser permanente medical centers. experience and survival were not significantly associated in the early study years (1989-1990). the prenatal care assistance program appeared to be successful in reducing the incidence of low birth weight and preterm delivery in this high-risk population. hospitalization was less likely for patients in clinics with case managers (adjusted

hospitalized patients with pcp in these two institutions differed considerably, but the survival rates were not significantly different, even after adjusting for confounding factors. the average length of a hospital inpatient stay was halved for those patients who had participated in the project for two years, and the average number of visits to the outpatient clinic per month fell for patients with aids. at baseline gmc patients were more likely to be african american (85% vs 71%; p =.03) and had lower baseline cd4+ cell counts than idc patients (262 +/- the adjusted odds of being prescribed antiretroviral therapy increased 21% per month in period 2 and decreased to 3% per month in period 3. active patients also had longer survival than inactive patients when stratified by cd4+

ci, 1.05 to 5.50). length of stay and intensive care unit use were also significantly higher at low-experience hospitals after controlling for severity of illness (p < .05). contact with case managers was not significantly associated with utilization of ambulatory care (or, 0.77 [ci, 0.57 to 1.04]), hospitalization (or, 1.13 [ci, 0.84 to 1.54]), or emergency department visits ( persons on prophylaxis had 20% lower adjusted odds of developing pcp (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.64, 0.99). we found that for federal health programme clients in need of ancillary services, a positive relationship existed between their receipt of ancillary services and their access to primary medical care (p </= 0.001). there were no significant differences in patient outcome as measured by

strong evidence of intervention impact for 3-month, 1-month, and 7-day abstinence and duration since last cigarette (p = .09, .015, .01, and .03, respectively). further, nicotine dependence was positively correlated with duration of smoking and number of cigarettes smoked daily (p<.05). among teenagers who were available at follow-up, a medium effect size (cohen's h = .38) was found for reduction and a large effect size (cohen's h = .69) was found for percentage reduction, although these results also were not statistically significant. seventeen percent of the smokers enrolled in the clinics had reports of having quit smoking for at least the last 30 days at 3-month follow-up (5 months after the program quit day), compared to only 8% of the control condition smokers over than same time period. those who participated in the program were significantly more likely than controls to report at the immediate post-intervention assessment that they had abstained from smoking during the past week (p<or=.01), smoked fewer days in the past week (p<or=.001), smoked fewer cigarettes in the past week (p<or=.01), and considered themselves a former smoke (p<or=.05). although treated participants improved more in tobacco related knowledge relative to controls (p = 0.002), there were no group differences in changes in attitudes toward smoking. mi was more effective than ba for adolescents with little or no intention to change their smoking, but was actually less effective for adolescents with pre-existing intention to cut down or quit smoking. during treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. not smoking cessation and reduction outcomes were significantly better than those of the brief intervention. mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean: 78.4-82.8%) than for the gum (mean: 38.5-50.7%). a greater proportion of participants in the treatment condition (n = 26) reported cessation attempts and point abstinence than did control participants (n = 28) at all time points. the mi intervention resulted in significant short-term reductions in quantity and frequency of smoking relative to standard care, however, effects were not maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up. sustained abstinence, reflecting 7-day abstinence at both time points, in the self-help and counseling arms was 7% and 9% (p = .59). health risk appraisal, when accompanied by feedback counseling, was an effective health promotion tool to help prevent nonsmokers from acquiring the habit and to modify cigarette smoking behavior among college freshmen. at 3-month follow-up, only those in mi showed cotinine levels that were significantly reduced compared to baseline. despite the lack of a treatment effect, a large majority of adolescents in both treatment groups reduced their consumption to a few cigarettes per day or less and maintained this reduction over time. abstinence rates after

in the ctd but there were no significant treatment-related changes in body composition, lipids, prostate-specific antigen, haematological or biochemical variables. prostate volumes did not change significantly in either group. serum hdl cholesterol levels declined significantly in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 12.0% +/- hemoglobin concentrations rose, and

and lng 500 compared with lng 0). there were no significant changes in lipoprotein or haemoglobin concentrations in any group. dsg 150 or 300 plus t 100 suppressed spermatogenesis as effectively as lng 125-t 100 and more effectively than dsg 50-t 100 or testosterone alone. serum levels of lh as well as total and free t at baseline and after tb injection were lower in the responders than in the nonresponders. suppression to severe oligozoospermia was less in the non-chinese men (59%) after t alone (p < 0.020); this difference disappeared with combined treatment (89%). as compared with the placebo group, more men in the active treatment groups reported adverse events such as weight gain, mood changes, acne, sweating, or libido change. there were no significant changes in body weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations during treatment. serum dihydrotestosterone levels were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the dutasteride group throughout the treatment period to a nadir of 31% baseline (wk 7). high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fell by 15% in caucasian men, but was unchanged in the chinese men; both groups showed some weight gain. there was no consistent difference in mean lh and fsh levels among the three groups during treatment or recovery, except that fsh remained detectable in a higher proportion of samples from the group receiving 300 microg dsg with 50 mg t enanthate. there were no changes in blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, prostate-specific antigen (psa), sex hormone binding globulin (shbg), prolactin or cortisol. after treatment cessation, recovery of sperm counts and gonadotropins to normal levels occurred in both groups. none of the subjects in the 1-implant group exhibited oligozoospermia (sperm count, <3 million/ml). t enanthate (300 mg/week), was no more effective than 100 mg/week in suppressing lh, fsh, and sperm production. in all groups marked suppression of gonadotropins resulted in a significant decrease of spermatogenesis and azoospermia in 13/14, 11/12, and 12/14 men in groups i to iii, respectively. during treatment, group ii demonstrated a trend toward a greater attainment of azoospermia than groups i and iii (90% vs 62% [group i] vs 67% [group iii]; p =.09). suppression was slower in group ii, which also demonstrated more frequent escape from gonadotrophin suppression than groups i and iii. there were no significant changes in lipoproteins, fibrinogen or sexual behaviour during treatment, and minor falls in haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration. significant suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone was achieved within 2 weeks of treatment in both groups, while testosterone concentrations were maintained in the normal physiological range. consistent azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia was achieved and maintained in all volunteers during the treatment period, except for two men in the tu-alone group who experienced a rebound in sperm concentrations. in the group receiving only 19nt-hpp, serum lh and fsh were markedly suppressed and remained low during the treatment phase. 3.6% in men given t plus lng (p < 0.05), compared to only a 1.8 +/- there was a trend toward higher pretreatment gonadotropin levels and lower sperm counts in men who became azoospermic. tu 1000 mg im alone

however, these treatments were superior to acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination. paracetamol and rofecoxib combined improved the analgesic effect compared with rofecoxib alone for the first 1.5 h. rofecoxib alone and the combination of paracetamol and rofecoxib had a significantly better analgesic effect than paracetamol alone from 3 h onwards. although efficacy was lower for the acetaminophen-phenyltoloxamine combination than for acetaminophen alone, for every variable, the contrast for interaction was not statistically significant. ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for the sum of pain intensity difference, total pain relief, and reduction of pain by more than 50% (p less than .05), suggesting a more rapid onset of action and a more prolonged effect by ibuprofen 400 mg. acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of analgesia, and their effects were significant for 4 and 5 hours respectively. oral surgery pain is a reliable model to reference the effectiveness of commonly used analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. overall, the combination was slightly better than acetaminophen alone. for most pain intensity and pain relief measurements, 1000 mg acetaminophen was statistically superior to placebo, demonstrating assay sensitivity, and 10 and 25 mg doses of bromfenac were statistically better than both placebo and 5 mg bromfenac for ordinal and analog ratings of pain intensity and pain relief; 25 mg bromfenac produced significantly longer time to remedication than acetaminophen. both doses of diflunisal were significantly more effective than acetaminophen alone and produced peak analgesia comparable to that of the acetaminophen-codeine combination. for many efficacy variables, all active treatments were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective than placebo. the combination was significantly superior to acetaminophen alone for all analgesic measures including spid, total, and global ratings. flurbiprofen was significantly superior to the acetaminophen codeine combination with respect to the number of hours until remedication. piroxicam-beta-cyclodextrin and paracetamol were more rapid than piroxicam in inducing analgesia. the mean scores for the summary variable percent sum of the pain intensity differences (% spid) were higher in all for the combination than for acetaminophen alone, and in two studies the null hypothesis of no differences was rejected. flurbiprofen in 50 mg and 100 mg dosages demonstrated effective analgesic activity with the 100 mg dosage being at least as effective as the acetaminophen/codeine combination. a positive dose-effect relationship was evident for both acetaminophen 500 mg. at 1 h after dosage, pain scores were significantly less (p < 0.01) after both doses of ketoprofen when compared with placebo. propacetamol bolus resulted in a much higher incidence of local adverse events than the infusion (propacetamol bolus 90% vs propacetamol infusion 52%) with no clinically significant benefits in terms of analgesic efficacy. (r)- ketoprofen possesses analgesic activity and an acceptable side-effect profile in the oral surgery pain model. however, in patients with moderate baseline pain, no differences were found between the study drugs in any of the analgesic efficacy variables. in addition, both ibuprofen and ketoprofen showed statistical superiority over acetaminophen at earlier time points on the time-effect curves for pain relief and pain intensity difference. the most important finding was the statistically significantly shorter period until the onset of the action of paracetamol as against acetyl salicylic acid. statistical significance was only seen for the parameter pain intensity (spid) on comparison of suprofen 100 mg + apap 650 mg versus suprofen 200 mg. pain relief after the initial dose of diclofenac-k (2 x 12.5 mg) was superior to placebo (p < .01 for all efficacy outcomes) and comparable to paracetamol (2 x 500 mg). codeine 60 mg was not consistently superior to placebo in this post-operative single dose analysis. statistically significant pain relief (mean pain intensity differences and sum of pain intensity differences) was seen in the group receiving paracetamol compared to those receiving placebo or tiaramide from 1 h to 6 h after drug ingestion. both doses of flurbiprofen resulted in significant analgesia in comparison with placebo, acetaminophen, and acetaminophen plus codeine as measured by pain intensity difference, pain relief, and global evaluation. there were few adverse effects other than sedation, which occurred twice as frequently in patients treated with nalbuphine as in those receiving acetaminophen or placebo. ibuprofen was found to be the most effective analgesic in post-episiotomy pain followed by analgin and paracetamol in that order. the combination product was significantly (p less than 0.05) superior to either butorphanol (4 mg) or acetaminophen (650 mg) as well as placebo. there were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to the number of patients requiring rescue medication, however the time to dosing was significantly longer for those taking soluble aspirin when compared with placebo (hazard ratio 2.34, 95% ci 1.41 to 3.88, p<0.001). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> postsurgical dental outpatients as subjects pain resulting from extraction of impacted third molar teeth eighty-eight

p < .05). for each 1-sd increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. in girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% cl, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% cl, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years. among non-smokers, the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke, the belief that smoking is fun, peers, siblings and mother consumption, and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers. among experimental smokers, the majority (64%) were receptive to tobacco marketing, which had a multivariate association with higher level of lifetime smoking (movie smoking did not). two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the california tobacco surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later. among time 1 ever smokers, both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78, 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18, 2.23), respectively], and the two estimates were not significantly different. for boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys. the most important predictor of smoking for boys, having a best friend who smoked, was significant on application of the chi 2 test (p 0.037), although it was non-significant when included singly in a logistic regression model (0.094); the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke. cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour, beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable. this study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for white (susceptibility and ever smoking) and african american (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for hispanic adolescents. among the cohort, baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, p = 0.0001), brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86, p = 0.0004), and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87, p = 0.0002). adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither. adjusting for multiple risk factors, the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week), and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]). the older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category, with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 3,664 spanish children aged 13 and 14 years filled in self-completion questionnaires at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months later (cohort study cigarettes and adolescent smoking primary, middle, and secondary schools in the north and south of england girls and young women 1752 adolescent never smokers who were not susceptible to smoking when first interviewed in 1993 in a population-based random-digit dial telephone survey in california were reinterviewed in 1996 never smokers who would not consider experimenting with smoking, never smokers who would consider experimenting, experimenters (smoked at least once but fewer than 100 cigarettes), or established smokers (smoked at least 100 cigarettes 784 experimenters youth smoking triethnic sample of adolescents those who became smokers (adopters schoolchildren in sixth and seventh grades in barcelona (11-13 years) and identifies smoking risk factors through cross-sectional and follow-up analysis a school-based, ethnically diverse (42% white, 37% african american, 20% hispanic) sample of adolescents in grades 5, 8, and 12 who were followed prospectively for 1 year self completed questionnaires administered to whole classes of schoolchildren in june 1993 and june 1994 adolescents were aged 12 to 15 years and were not established smokers more than half the sample (n=979) named a favorite cigarette advertisement in 1993 and joe camel advertisements 509 students who were nonsusceptible, never smokers at baseline and (b) "ever smoking" among all 659 students who were never smokers at baseline (both susceptible and nonsusceptible 2102 adolescents, aged 10 to 17 years at baseline, who never smoked was conducted by using masked images of 6 cigarette advertisements and 8 other commercial products with all brand information digitally removed baseline never smokers were analyzed separately from those who had tried smoking (ever smokers 4384 adolescents age 11-15 years at baseline and re-surveyed 1 year later;

vertical transmission from mother to child was 11 infections/100 live births (95% ci, 4.6-21.9); these rates are significantly lower than expected rates of transmission in haiti. after changes to service delivery, time-to-treatment initiation was reduced from a median of 56 days to 37 days (p = 0.041). main outcome indicators were the proportion of treatment-eligible pregnant women enrolling into hiv care within 60 days of hiv diagnosis, and of these, the proportion initiating art during pregnancy. observational data demonstrated that providers who participated in the training intervention delivered pmtct counseling of a consistently higher quality than did providers who did not undergo training. provider-initiated testing and counselling is feasible and acceptable in family planning services, does not adversely affect the quality of the family planning consultation and increases access to and use of hiv testing in a population who would benefit from knowing their status. community-based reproductive health agents (cbrhas) can increase community knowledge of and offer immediate access to reproductive health services, including hiv/aids. contraceptive use increased from 38% before hiv testing to 52% 1 week later (p < 0.0001) and then decreased to 46% by 12 months. the average staff workload was found to be 50.5% (8-147%) for facilities providing pmtct of hiv infection and 37.8% (11-82%) for facilities without pmtct services. women were as likely as men to achieve high attendance rates before the interventions, but more likely to do so at both 6 months and 1 year postintervention (after adjustment for the other variables). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> mother-to-child hiv transmission services in ukraine 1566 patients found eligible for art 1273 and 735 children were enrolled in the rc and pc hiv-positive and hiv-negative women who were offered hiv counselling and testing during a program of prevention of mother-to-child hiv transmission between 1985 and 1999, services for hiv care, tuberculosis care, treatment of sexually transmitted diseases, and reproductive health women with hiv infection hiv-infected women, a maternal-child program was started at an hiv outpatient clinic in new orleans family planning clients through provider-initiated testing and counselling for hiv twenty-three public-sector hospitals, health centres and dispensaries in two districts of central province, kenya 143 women and 557 men (serving as controls women who had an unsafe abortion 164 pregnant women initiated arv treatment and 863 received sd-nvp women after hiv testing in abidjan, ivory coast 4019 vct clients attending eight ethiopian public sector facilities and 4027 additional clients 18 months after introducing family planning services in the same facilities malawian women eligible pregnant women in eight public sector clinics in lusaka district, zambia severe acute malnutrition in malawi severely malnourished children hiv-positive women women who were hiv-positive and not pregnant were enrolled and followed for 1 year while receiving hiv care and access to family planning (fp) services 213 hiv-1-serodiscordant couples in thika, kenya, participating in an hiv-1 prevention clinical trial, contraceptive promotion was initiated through a hiv-positive women in malawi 71 health facilities in nigeria that analyzes the preintegration and postintegration periods between march 2007 and january 2009 women in hiv-1-serodiscordant partnerships nigerian public health facilities 706 women were provided with hiv-positive women, offering sexually transmitted infection screening, cervical cytology and family planning rch clinics 4019 vct clients before the addition of family planning services and 4027 different clients after family planning services zambia before and after implementation of prevention of mother-to-child hiv transmission programs 502 women who were not pregnant or infertile and who had been previously hiv tested and counseled viewed an informational video about hormonal contraception followed by a facilitated discussion antenatal care in gauteng province, south africa caregivers and children admitted in the dowa ctc programme were prospectively (prospective cohort = pc) and retrospectively (retrospective cohort = rc) admitted into the study and offered hiv testing and counseling 15-year experience in haiti, 1985-2000 of those clients who were sexually active, 70% were using contraceptives between 16 july 2007 and 31 july 2008, 13,917 women started antenatal care more than 60 days before the intervention rollout and constituted the control cohort;

among treated women, b(a)p-dna adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (p = 0.03). as regards markers of hepatic fibrogenesis, vitamin e treatment decreased serum hyaluronic acid (p<0.05) while serum aminoterminal peptide of type iii procollagen did not change in either group. vitamin e supplementation is ineffective in reducing the progression of carotid atherosclerosis as measured by intima-media thickness in chronic smokers. alpha-tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death and non-fatal mi (41 vs 64 events; relative risk 0.53 there were 377 new cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the selenium group and 350 cases among the control group (relative risk [rr], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.95-1.28), and 218 new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190 cases among the controls (rr, 1.14; 95% ci, 0.93-1.39). smokers with gstm1-0 genotype had a tendency to higher baseline cca-imt values than those with gstm1-1 (0.97 versus 0.92 mm, p=0.09). despite random assignment, the baseline score on the mini-mental state examination was higher in the placebo group than in the other three groups, and this variable was highly predictive of the primary outcome (p<0.001). there were also no significant differences in the number of cases of lung cancer (82 in the beta carotene group vs. 88 in the placebo group); the number of deaths from cancer (386 vs. 380), deaths from any cause (979 vs. 968), or deaths from cardiovascular disease (338 vs. 313); the number of men with myocardial infarction (468 vs. 489); the number with stroke (367 vs. 382); or the number with any one of the previous three end points (967 vs. 972). number of symptoms, 6 (3-8) vs 4 (3-8), p =.03; presence of fever, 36.7% vs 25.2%, p =.009; and restriction of activity, 52.3% vs 41.1%, p =.02. after 6 months of supplementation, a significant increase in vitamin and trace element serum levels was obtained in the corresponding treatment groups: a plateau was then observed for the whole study. ratings of perceived claudication pain were significantly less after the polestriding training program (p= 0.02). vitamin e had no significant effect on incidence or number of days with infection for all, upper, or lower respiratory tract infections. a micronutrient supplement providing the reference nutrient intake administered over 8 weeks had no beneficial effect on antibody response to influenza vaccine in older people living in long-term care. there were no significant interactions between agents for the primary end point, but those randomized to both active ascorbic acid and vitamin e experienced fewer strokes (p value for interaction, .03). no substantial short-term beneficial effect on incidence or mortality for this type of cancer occurred following daily supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals among adults with precancerous lesions of the esophagus. there were statistically nonsignificant increased risks of prostate cancer in the vitamin e group (p = .06) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the selenium group (relative risk, 1.07; 99% ci, 0.94-1.22; p = .16) but not in the selenium + vitamin e group. gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin c levels were raised significantly in the supplemented group (p=0.01) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal level of this vitamin. oxidative stress is greater in haemodialysis patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease than in those without, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in excess cardiovascular disease in haemodialysis. no late effect of antioxidant supplementation was revealed 5 years after ending the intervention neither on ischemic cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality in both genders nor on cancer incidence in women. neither the primary nor the secondary outcome measures could determine whether a megadose of vitamin e is efficacious in slowing disease progression in als as an add-on therapy to riluzol. however, group two (antioxidant) also had increased cortical opacification of the right lens (p = 0.04), compared to group one (placebo). subjects without dementia had a greater rate of infections than those with dementia (or=1.44, 95% ci=1.19-1.76). at the 1-year follow-up, we observed a trend for lower mortality (p = 0.060) in subgroups treated with n-3 fatty acids, but without significant differences in rehabilitation result status among groups. patients in the vitamin e group had a higher risk of heart failure (rr, 1.13; 95% ci, 1.01-1.26; p = .03) and hospitalization for heart failure (rr, 1.21; 95% ci, 1.00-1.47; p = .045). in men, this treatment effect was 37% (95 ci, 4 to 69, p=0.028). the difference in the change of pgi/ii ratio between baseline and after 5-year follow up was statistically significant between the intervention groups among those who completed the supplementation: - 0.25 for the low-dose group and - 0.13 for the high-dose group (p = 0.046). in terms of the number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by betacarotene but the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lower in the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group (1115 vs 1832 per 100,000; 0.61 [0.46-0.81]). the infection rates in the vitamin a and placebo groups were 4.7 and 4.3 per 1,000 days of follow-up, respectively (relative risk 1.1; 95% ci 0.6, 2.0). the mean levels of ldl and hdl cholesterol were unaltered in the antioxidant group and the placebo group; these levels changed substantially (by -42 percent and +26 percent, respectively) in the simvastatin-niacin group. dietary levels of antioxidants (vitamin c, beta carotene, retinol equivalents) had no effect on cartilage volume loss. compared with placebo, alpha-tocopherol supplementation significantly raised plasma vitamin e levels (p<0.0001), reduced circulating oxidized ldl (p=0.03), and reduced ldl oxidative susceptibility (p<0.01). there were no significant differences in the rate of progression to alzheimer's disease between the vitamin e and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein e epsilon4 carriers. significantly (p = .03) lower total mortality (relative risk [rr] = 0.91 supplementation did not significantly affect contacts with primary care and days of infection per person (incidence rate ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.19 and 1.07, 0.90 to 1.27). there was also no significant difference between treated and control groups in the mean number of new nonmelanoma skin cancers per patient-year. there was a greater increase in the mv vs p group for serum 25(oh)d smoothed relative risk curves for lung cancer incidence and all-cause mortality indicated that relative risks remained above 1.0 throughout the post-intervention follow-up. cell-mediated immune function assessed by the number of t cells and subsets remained constant in the supplemented group and there was a significant increase in cd57 natural killer cells. after treatment, plasma ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased only in the vitamin-treated group, associated with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in plasma mda. two hundred patients believed to be free of polyps after removal of at least one colorectal polyp were randomized to receive a supplement of 400 mg each of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, or a placebo. funding surgery worldwide for age-related cataract (arc), a leading cause of blindness, is a huge economic burden. aspirin lowered the frequency of all the endpoints, being significant for cardiovascular death (from 1.4 to 0.8%; relative risk 0.56 [95% ci 0.31-0.99]) and total cardiovascular events (from 8.2 to 6.3%; 0.77 [0.62-0.95]). four hundred forty-eight participants completed the poms-bi questionnaires at both time points, with no significant differences in total mood or mood-subscale scores seen between doses. small improvements in fisk scores were recorded during placebo therapy (median improvement, 4; p = 0.03). patients treated with alpha-tocopherol tended to live longer without development of hcc but the difference was not statistically significant. for prostate cancer incidence (n = 672), the rr was 0.88 (95% ci, 0.76-1.03) for participants receiving alpha-tocopherol compared with nonrecipients. no statistically significant differences between the two treatment studied. there were no significant differences in mental test score, barthel score, or length of stay between the two groups. in groups 1 l and 2 l/a, mean eye macular pigment optical density increased approximately 0.09 log units from baseline, snellen equivalent visual acuity improved 5.4 letters for group 1 l and 3.5 letters for group 2 l/a, and contrast sensitivity improved. there was no difference in the standardized mortality ratios across gender or age group. all three basic interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in the rates of regression: relative risks were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.6-14.2) for anti-h. pylori treatment, 5 oral supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin e levels in the experimental group. compared with placebo, vitamin e had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events (both active and placebo vitamin e groups, 10.9 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [hr], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 0.90-1.13]; p = .86), as well as total myocardial infarction (hr, 0.90 [95% ci, 0.75-1.07]; p = .22), total stroke (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.89-1.29]; p = .45), and cardiovascular mortality (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.90-1.28]; p = .43). all four measures of dna damage decreased in both groups; the between-group differences were not statistically significant. antibody titers after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that received trace elements alone or associated with vitamins, whereas the vitamin group had significantly lower antibody titers (p<.05). neither treatment appeared to be effective in any subgroup of patients or in the prevention of any subtype of polyp defined by size or location. celecoxib status did not influence changes in dysplasia grade overall (p = .78) or by baseline histology subgroup. there was no statistically significant difference in progression rate (rate ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.74 to 1.15) or regression rate (rate ratio = 1.09, 95% ci = 0.90 to 1.33) between vitamin and placebo groups. plasma malondialdehyde decreased by 35% in both groups (p = 0.002) but not when adjusted for lipids. treatment with n-3 pufa, but not vitamin e, significantly lowered the risk of the primary endpoint (relative-risk decrease 10% [95% ci 1-18] by two-way analysis, 15% [2-26] by four-way analysis). there was no interaction between the 2 treatment interventions. mean absolute healing rates were 0.21 and 0.27 cm2/week in the intervention and control group, respectively (pi of the adjusted difference: -0.17 to 0.13). long-term vitamin or garlic supplementation had no beneficial effects on the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions or on gastric cancer incidence. for cardiovascular death, there was a significant 24% reduction (rr, 0.76; 95% ci, 0.59-0.98; p = .03). at the first evaluation of events, 18 months after initiating the study, the primary outcome was significantly reduced in individuals receiving vitamin e (2.2%) compared with placebo (4.7%; p=0.01) and led to early termination of the study. for nuclear cataract, the corresponding rates were 12.9% and 12.1% (p = 0.77). the mean serum total tocopherol (toc) concentration in the 100-mg group was significantly higher than that in the 3-mg group 6 months after the start of the study, and this raised value was maintained throughout the study; the level in the 3-mg group did not change significantly from the baseline value. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> april 1998 to august 2001 at 33 long-term care facilities in the boston, mass, area 1980 subjects in tachira state,

p = 0.009), but neither differed from sc (76% retained). self reported opiate and cocaine use and depressive and opioid withdrawal symptoms showed no differences among the groups and symptom levels did not correlate with urine toxicology results. both abstinence-reinforcement interventions increased cocaine abstinence, but the addition of the voucher intervention resulted in the largest and most sustained abstinence. the three treatments had similar efficacies with respect to the mean percentage of opioid-negative urine specimens (standard medical management and once-weekly medication dispensing, 44 percent; standard medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; and enhanced medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; p=0.82) and the maximum number of consecutive weeks during which patients were abstinent from illicit opioids. contingent vouchers and a methadone dose increase each significantly increased the percentage of opiate-negative urine specimens during intervention. patients in the cm condition submitted more cocaine-negative samples and attended more groups than patients in standard treatment. post-treatment, hrg patients scored higher on a sexual risk quiz and reported increased self-efficacy in high risk sexual situations. groups did not differ on study retention or counseling attendance. compared to participants receiving standard treatment, participants randomly assigned to the free plus guide mapping condition had significantly lower opiate use based on urinalysis and self-report data. the proportion of opioid-negative urine tests increased significantly over time for both groups (p<0.001), and the reductions were significantly greater in the enhanced services group (p<0.05); enhanced services group achieved higher overall proportions of opiate negative urine toxicology tests (87% vs. 69%, p=0.04) and longer periods of consecutive abstinence from opiates (10.3 weeks vs. 7.8 weeks, p=0.154). the msc vs. ssc condition was associated with a higher rate of counseling attendance (83% vs. 44%, p < .001) and a lower rate of poor treatment response (46% vs. 79%, p < .001). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 160 cocaine abusers maintained on participants were 252 heroin- and cocaine-abusing outpatients on methadone maintenance 166 patients assigned to one of three treatments unemployed methadone patients one hundred eighty subjects 151 subjects substance abusers maintained patients heroin dependent individuals (n=37) enrolling in two mmt clinics in wuhan, china, received standard mmt services, consisting of daily medication at the clinics and infrequent additional services on demand methadone-maintained patients who inject drugs seventy-two opiate addicts dependent participants (n=140 participants in the 2 abstinence-reinforcement groups could earn take-home methadone doses for providing opiate- and cocaine-free urine samples;

amitriptyline was slightly better than maprotiline (p < .05) [tested by repeated measures analysis of variance (anova)]. (1) gabapentin-treated patients showed statistically significant improvement in pain reduction as well as improvement in quality of life and mood disturbance when compared with placebo-treated patients; subjective reports indicated a greater reduction in pain at 2 and 4 weeks on amitriptyline, but no difference at 6 weeks. side effects were troublesome with both agents. there were no significant differences between the groups in treatment effects for pain or pain-related symptoms. a statistically significant decrease was seen in pain in groups 1 and 2, and no significant changes were seen in groups 3 and 4. the plasma levels of imipramine and its metabolite desipramine were significantly higher in patients who benefited from imipramine treatment. results showed that early treatment with low-dose amitriptyline reduced pain prevalence by more than one-half (p < 0.05; odds ratio, 2.9:1) the incidence of adverse events for all patients was similar in both groups (tramadol 76.5%; clomipramine with or without levomepromazine 83.3%). the results clearly indicate the better analgesic effect of tricyclic antidepressants over placebo (p less than 0.0001). gabapentin produced greater pain reductions than amitriptyline (mean final scores were 1.9 vs. 1.3 points below baseline scores; p = 0.026). although both drugs provide pain relief, mean pain score and global pain score data indicate no significant difference between gabapentin and amitriptyline. overall pain was significantly reduced by doxepin, capsaicin and doxepin/capsaicin to a similar extent. there was a significant decrease in the incidence of chest wall pain (55% vs. 19%, p = 0.0002), arm pain (45% vs. 17%, p = 0.003), and axilla pain (51% vs. 19%, p = 0.0009) between the control group and the venlafaxine group, respectively. there were no substantial differences between the two treatments in spitzer's quality of life score and for each item. both clomipramine and desipramine significantly reduced the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by observer- and self rating in comparison with placebo. the 'poor responders' reported significantly more adverse effects with amitriptyline and placebo than the good responders. by the end of the study, the interference with daily activities by pain had diminished significantly (p = .001) in both groups, including improvements in sleeping and walking. there was no significant difference in pain intensity reduction between the maximum tolerated dose of venlafaxine (75 mg in most cases) and the placebo. we found good to excellent pain relief in 16 of 24 patients (p less than or equal to 0.001). the sum of the individual pain scores during treatment week 4 was lower on venlafaxine (80% of baseline score; p = 0.006) and imipramine (77%; p = 0.001) than on placebo (100%) and did not show any statistical difference between venlafaxine and imipramine (p = 0.44). pain relief tended to be greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. none of the individual pain ratings were significantly changed by st. john's wort as compared to placebo (p=0.09--0.33). no significant changes were noted in reported pain measures between patients allocated to the active drug group and those given placebo during the course of the protocol. five of the 14 patients treated with carbamazepine reported some pain relief, but the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to placebo. amitriptyline reduced the depression scores in the depressed group but had no effect on the depression scores in the non-depressed group. distigmine alone also decreased pain and increased saliva flow, sometimes to the point of discomfort, whereas amitriptyline alone, in this particular series, did not significantly reduce pain and produced unpleasant mouth dryness. the therapeutic analgesic efficacy of the two drugs proved to be similar. neither paroxetine nor imipramine caused changes in objective measures of peripheral nerve function. despite some adverse effects, especially of an anticholinergic nature, the patients generally preferred imipramine to placebo. nineteen patients completed both treatments; 12 reported at least moderate relief with desipramine and two reported relief with placebo. neither amitriptyline nor mexiletine provide significant pain relief in patients with hiv-associated painful sensory neuropathy. citalopram significantly relieved the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by both observer- and self-rating in comparison with placebo. the results after three months of treatment showed that clomipramine: (1) was better than amitriptyline in treating trigeminal neuralgia; (2) tended to be better in the treatment of tension headache; and (3) amitriptyline is better in treating postherpatic neuralgia. no significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. the placebo group showed a pain rate of 21% within 1 year after the diagnosis of thalamic stroke compared with 17% in the group under prophylactic treatment with amitriptyline. side effects experienced with bupropion sr were not dose-limiting and consisted primarily of dry mouth, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal upset, tremor, constipation, and dizziness. treatment with imipramine hydrochloride or amitriptyline hydrochloride resulted in complete remission of lower extremity pains in all patients in 10 +/- the areas of allodynia and pin-prick hyperalgesia decreased significantly in venlafaxine groups compared to the placebo. the differences in responses between amitriptyline and desipramine and between fluoxetine and placebo were not statistically significant, but both amitriptyline and desipramine were superior to placebo. we found no difference with regard to relief of steady, brief, or skin pain by visual analog scales for pain and pain relief; mood; disability; satisfaction; or preference between the two drugs. for both the acupuncture and amitriptyline comparisons, changes in pain score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores. greater relief was associated with higher amitriptyline doses, up to the maximum dose of 150 mg/d, and with higher serum tricyclic levels. it seems possible that clomipramine activates serotonin-containing neurons of the endorphin-mediated analgesia system that control pain transmission in the cns. the results showed the superiority of dothiepin over placebo in achieving pain relief;

95% ci, 5.27 to 16.42; p < .001) and less frequent douching (mean difference, -0.76; 95% ci, -1.15 to -0.37; p = .001). data obtained at a 3-month follow-up assessment showed that girls who received the hiv-related intervention improved their hiv-related knowledge and enhanced their motivation for risk reduction compared to girls who received a control (health promotion) intervention. the increase in the percentage of sexual acts protected by female condoms from baseline to the 6-month follow-up was greater for the experimental group. the condom promotion intervention led to increased self-reported condom use up to 6 months following intervention as well as positive changes in perceived benefits of condom use, affective attitudes toward condom use and condom users, perceived acceptance of sexuality, control over the sexual encounter, perceived self-efficacy for condom use, and intentions to use condoms. significantly more intervention women carried condoms, discussed condoms with partners, and had higher self-efficacy to use condoms with primary partners. we found no differences between neighborhoods with and without the power campaign with regard to our primary outcomes. to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors, sexually transmitted diseases (stds), and pregnancy and enhance mediators of hiv-preventive behaviors. these results provide partial support for the hypothesis that an imb model-based intervention leads to reductions in sexual risk behavior and suggest directions for future research. this randomized controlled trial indicates that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for reducing behavioral risk and preventing stis and ups in young, sexually active women who are not seeking health care. at 3-month follow-up, those who saw the video and received counseling were 2.5 times more likely to have used a condom at last intercourse with their main partner than teens in the usual care group. at 1 month, compared with control participants, intervention participants had increased sexual risk knowledge and more positive attitudes toward condoms and tended to use condoms more with a nonmain partner. self-reports revealed that those assigned to the interactive video were significantly more likely to be abstinent in the first 3 months following initial exposure to the intervention, and experienced fewer condom failures in the following 3 months, compared to controls. the computer-based transtheoretical model-tailored intervention resulted in a 70% increase in reported dual-method contraceptive use in a group of women at high risk for stis and unintended pregnancy. the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in aids knowledge and intentions to use condoms, and fewer sex partners at the six-month follow-up as compared to the control group. multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for condom use at enrollment demonstrated that the experimental intervention (odds ratio = 2.8; p = 0.03) and the higher cognitive complexity (odds ratio = 4.6; p = 0.02) independently contributed to greater condom use at follow-up. according to intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to the hiv-prevention group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum than individual-care and attention-matched controls; they demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual intercourse compared with individual-care and attention-matched controls. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> male condoms for 15-25 year-old-women sample included young women (n = 497) of predominantly poor, latina backgrounds who had complete data from baseline to the one-year follow-up african american adolescent females adolescent females' std risk 62 sexually-active, single girls 3407 women at pre-campaign in 12 western u.s. neighborhoods on female and male condom awareness, attitudes, and use young women at risk for hiv/sexually transmitted disease (std 522 sexually experienced african american girls aged 14 to 18 years screened from december 1996 through april 1999 at 4 community health agencies mexican-american and african-american women at high risk for sexually transmitted disease college-aged women mean age of participants was 20.4 years;

total intra-hospital homologous blood replacement was not significantly different, the postoperative drainage and transfusion device was efficacious in reducing the amount of allogeneic red cells required by patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, and its use resulted in a 42 percent reduction in the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusion. c-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and troponin-t increased after surgery in both groups without intergroup differences. the two groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, weight, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, and surgical procedure. autotransfusion did not produce any significant derangement of thromboelastograph values or laboratory measures of clotting pathway function (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen d-dimer levels) when compared with the effect of homologous blood transfusion (p = ns, repeated measures analysis of variance [manova]). the amount of postoperative autologous blood salvage averaged 946 ml. only 25% of the study group required postoperative transfusions, compared to 83% of the control group (p = .016). the amount of hb that was transfused during the operation was significantly lower in groups ii and iii than in group i (p less than 0.0001). sonoclot coagulation analyses better correlated to both blood loss and dextran dosage than aptt and platelet count in the routine coagulation analyses. use of cell saver reduced intraoperative net blood loss and seemed to reduce transfusions by 1 unit per patient, however, this was probably attributable to more complications leading to transfusion in the control group. cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma utilization also was less in the autotransfusion group than in the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance. a cost comparison analysis showed that blood salvage was more expensive than pabt, and therefore it should be limited to patients who had predeposited fewer than three units of autologous blood. although both groups had a decrease in lung perfusion postoperatively, there were no significant differences among the groups regarding the lung perfusion scintigraphy, chest x-rays, abg, and d-dimer values. the length of stay was reduced in those patients who received autologous blood (9 days vs. 12 days, p < 0.05 mann-whitney u test). fibrin split products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). there were no detrimental effects of autologous blood transfusion. these values in preoperatively collected autologous blood and allogeneic blood were out of normal range; (p<0.001). the chest tube drainage was significantly less in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3, with total drainage (median [interquartile range]) amounting to 250 ml the incidence of re-exploration was zero in both the groups. there was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic blood (32% in both groups, relative risk 1.0 p = 0.89). patients who received autologous blood had higher levels of haemoglobin at 8 hours (p < 0.05) and 24 hours postoperatively (p < 0.01) and needed less allogeneic blood transfusion (p < 0.01). no complications or adverse effects were observed from reinfusion. the number of patients requiring homologous blood transfusion was significantly different between the 2 groups (54/98 [55%] in autotransfused patients vs 73/100 [73%] in the control group, p =.01). 87.44 ml in the at patients, a reduction of 38.7% (p less than 0.05). only 7% of patients in the autotransfusion group required an allogeneic transfusion compared with 28% in the control group (p<0.001). there were no significant differences between patients randomized to iat and control patients in estimated blood loss (ebl), allogeneic blood transfusion (units administered intraoperatively, postoperatively, and total), proportion of patients not receiving allogeneic blood (34% of patients randomized to iat and 28% of control patients), postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and complications. comparison of the two groups showed no significant difference in regard to age, sex, operations performed, or total postoperative bleeding (ats 813 +/- the use of any blood product was avoided in 95% and 80% of the patients, respectively (not significant). there was no significant difference in the postoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin values between the two groups. the median amount of homologous blood required after operation by the study group was reduced by 74% from the amount required by the control group (mean, 67 ml vs 256 ml, respectively; p less than .0001). the fibrin degradation products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). at d + 1, the hematocrit was comparable in all groups (ogr = 28%, sgr = 28.2% and cgr = 28.5%).(abstract truncated at 250 words) patient bleeding times were not significantly different between the groups at any of the time points, and the total postoperative blood loss was not different between the groups. group 1 required 15 units of bank blood, group 2, 90 units (p < 0.001), and group 3, 102 units (p < 0.001). no complications or episodes of hypotension, confusion, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, febrile reaction, or coagulopathy were observed during or after the reinfusion of the unwashed, filtered, salvaged blood. whilst auto-transfusion does not appear to compromise haemostasis, it does not reduce the requirement for homologous blood and heparin-bonding of the circuit has no impact. conclusions intraoperative cell salvage and autotransfusion was associated with higher postoperative hemoglobin concentrations, a modest reduction in transfusion requirements, no adverse clinical or coagulopathic effects, and no significant increase in cost compared with controls. off-pump cabg is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump cabg. at 20 hours after surgery, an increase of serum pct concentration (>0.5-2 ng/ml) was more frequent in group 2 (58.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.03). postoperatively, in both groups, at iii, plasminogen, and protein c decreased. the use of blood conservation techniques resulted in reductions of homologous blood requirements of 34%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, in groups ii to iv as compared with the requirement in group i. there was no relationship between retransfusions and postoperative febrile reactions. during the first 24 h after surgery, the autotransfusion group had a significantly higher serum level of ck-mb. evaluation of clotting studies showed no significant differences between patients who received shed blood and patients who received liquid-preserved red blood cells. global coagulation tests, antithrombin iii, and total serum protein were comparable in the four groups. their administration caused a significant increase in tat and fpa levels in groups 2 and 3 compared to group homologous blood transfusion was required in only 35% of patients in the study group compared with 95% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.001). no significant differences were seen between the groups in any of the parameters measured. no clinically significant intergroup differences were found in hematologic, renal or hepatic parameters, neurologic function or use of antibiotics. the incidence of post-operative complications, such as wound infection, deep-vein thrombosis and chest infection, was also comparable between the groups. use of autotransfusion effectively reduced the need for hbt and was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative sirs and infective complications. the clinical safety of this technique was confirmed by the lack of septic, hematological, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic complications. in the control group, 2,3-dpg levels decreased from 4.3 to 3.9 mumol/ml erythrocyte during the same period. the estimated blood loss and cell saver return volumes were less for those patients undergoing afb for occlusive disease compared with those undergoing afb for aneurysmal disease. significantly more allogeneic blood was required by the control group than by the reinfusion group (p = 0.022). postoperative chest tube drainage was higher in the patients from group a, which also had the highest postoperative d-dimer levels. additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between hemoglobin levels and drainage volumes in both the tha and tka study groups, compared to their respective control groups. in the two groups, no significant difference in the mean blood loss was observed during 24 hours after the operation (660 +/- the preoperative reservation of autoblood in patients with ihd for operations of coronary bypass under conditions of ec and using the cell saver gives higher values of hemoglobin and erythrocytes by the moment of discharge of the patients from the hospital, but non the less does not reduce the frequency of using homologous blood. in patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. no differences were noted between two groups in terms of clinical parameters; likewise the operative characteristics were similar for the two groups. eligible consecutive primary and revision total hip and knee replacement patients were randomized for one of the two systems or for a control group in which shed blood was not re-infused. the mean hb concentration was significantly higher in group a on day 1 there was an average saving of 1.1 unit of allogeneic blood per patient in group a (p<0.001). there was no significant difference in the mean post-operative haemoglobin levels in the two groups. there was no statistically significant difference in transfusion requirements or wound complications among the four groups. the use of the autologous transfusion system (bellovac) proved to be safe but failed to reduce the need for postoperative homologous blood transfusion following uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty. it was also shown that autotransfusion without aspirin does reduce the need for donor blood transfusion without any increase in post-operative bleeding. no statistical difference was found in the number of patients who had excessive postoperative drainage from a drained or non-drained wound. prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) did not increase, and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected.(abstract truncated at 250 words) 32 of the patients in the intraoperative cell salvage group were given any blood product, compared with 47 in the control group (odds ratio 0.47 (0.25 to 0.89); p=0.019). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> autotransfusion of shed mediastinal blood after open heart surgery

changes in the rest of the parameters evaluated although a trend of reduction in glycohemoglobin levels was observed in both groups. glycated haemoglobin showed no significant change six months after transfer from either bovine or porcine to human insulin. concentrations of antibody reactive with porcine and human insulins were similar for the two treatment groups, although greater fluctuation was observed in the amount of antibody reactive with human insulin. at all times the mean insulin antibody levels and the percentage of antibody-positive patients were lower in the human group compared with the porcine group. the patients not treated with insulin showed a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in blood glucose control 2 months after in-patient assessment but this improvement was not sustained to 6 months. mean levels of fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, and daily insulin dosages showed no statistical differences between the two groups, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemic reactions. igg insulin antibody levels were identical after human insulin treatment (5.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/l) compared to pork insulin treatment (5.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/l). on comparison of the treatment periods with human and porcine insulins, no differences were demonstrated in the total frequency of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (3.10 vs 3.06 episodes patient-1 3-months-1; p = 0.94), the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (0.1 vs 0.2 episodes patient-1 3-months-1; p = 0.44), the occurrence of asymptomatic biochemical hypoglycaemia (0.75 vs 0.68

insulin without aggravating the incidence of hypoglycaemia, in spite of two major risk factors, i.e. advanced age and diabetes of long duration. no severe hypoglycemic attacks or skin reactions were reported. the development of insulin-binding antibodies during the first year of observation was more rapid in patients treated with mc pork insulin but thereafter it was similar in the two studied groups. daily insulin dose increased significantly from a mean of 51 units to 57 units (p less than 0.01) 4 months after beginning the study.(abstract truncated at 250 words) biochemical hypoglycaemia (<3.5 mmol l(-1)) was observed on 39 of the 80 patient-nights studied (48.75%). patients achieved significantly (p less than 0.01) lower pre-lunch blood glucose on velosulin/insulatard than on any other regimen, but severe hypoglycaemic events were more common (p less than 0.05) on this regimen. we could find no statistically significant differences between the insulin species with respect to glycaemic control or the frequency, timing, severity, or awareness of hypoglycaemia. no adverse reactions, injection-site anomalies, or drug-related biochemical abnormalities were noted in either group. there were no significant changes within the groups nor differences between the groups in mean preprandial capillary blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin or insulin dose during the first 24 weeks of the study. human insulin was shown to be indistinguishable from porcine insulin of comparable purity with respect to plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and insulin dose requirements. mean fasting and post-breakfast blood glucose levels were significantly lower with human ultralente as were fasting concentrations of glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids (p less than 0.05). no clinical reactions to human insulin occurred, and there was no significant difference in the daily insulin dose between porcine and human insulin. 4.4 u/day, p less than 0.01), yet the metabolic control achieved was virtually identical during both phases: (hemoglobin alc 8.6 +/- patient follow-up was done throughout the program by glycohemoglobin assays and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. hunger and sweating without concomitant neuroglycopenic symptoms were significantly more frequent as initial warning symptoms during porcine than during human insulin (41% vs 20%), whereas neuroglycopenic symptoms were more frequent during human insulin. there was no difference between the two patient groups throughout treatment either in the level of igg insulin binding or the percentage of patients with insulin antibodies (igg-insulin greater than 0.012 u/l). during controlled hypoglycaemia the mean adrenaline response was 138 nmol/l/240 min for both insulins; neurohormonal responses were triggered at 3.0 (se 0.2) versus 3.1 (0.2) mmol/l of glucose for adrenaline and 2.5 (0.1) versus 2.5 (0.1) mmol/l for subjective awareness. the glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin a1 levels, tended to deteriorate in the human insulin group during the first 3 months of the trial and then return to the baseline level. insulin doses and blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin a1c, and fructosamine concentrations were similar during the two treatment periods. women receiving human insulin required significantly less insulin per kilogram of body weight and showed significant dampening of glucose excursions (p < 0.05 for each comparison). in bovine-insulin-treated patients blood glucose before the evening insulin injection was higher on bhi than on bovine insulin (11.6 vs 10.0 mmol/l). in conclusion, there was no improvement of metabolic control, in spite of a decrease of ia in type i diabetics treated during 6 months with less immunogenic

treatment limbs (p = 0.04), the difference in improvement between doses (100 microg fp bid, 1.6 dose steps; 250 microg fp bid, 3.3 dose steps) approaching significance after 24 weeks (p = 0.06). at the end of the first week of treatment, patients in both fluticasone groups had significantly greater improvements in morning pef than did those receiving placebo. after 4 weeks, the maximum plasma fp concentration (cmax) in this subgroup was 0.096 microg/l [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.066-0.141] and the area under the plasma fp concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable concentration (auclast) was 0.491 microg/l x h (95% ci: 0.256-0.940). bal inflammatory cells decreased following 3 months of treatment with no further improvement at 12 months (p<0.05 v placebo). partial protection was demonstrated against the late-response allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia with both treatments ( p = .001). compared with placebo, sm50 significantly reduced the numbers of neutrophils in bronchial biopsy samples and the concentrations of myeloperoxidase and soluble e-selectin in serum, each of which reflect neutrophil involvement. at the study endpoint, saba patients treated with fp and placebo had mean increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline of 0.23 +/- there were no statistically significant differences at endpoint among the three fluticasone propionate groups. montelukast is not as effective as low dose fluticasone in reducing or maintaining an anti-inflammatory effect in steroid naive eosinophilic asthma. no dose-response effect or clinically relevant differences were observed in morning plasma cortisol concentrations or after cosyntropin stimulation. fp-treated versus placebo-treated children showed significant changes in percentage symptom-free days, use of beta2-mimetics, morning and evening pef, fev1 % pred and wheezing. the combination product significantly (p </= 0.011) reduced asthma symptom scores and supplemental albuterol use, and significantly increased the percentage of nights with no awakenings as compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fp (p </= the fev1, measured the morning after the last inhalation, was significantly higher after the active treatments, compared with placebo (p < 0.02), but did not differ between all active treatments. fluticasone propionate suppressed cortisol secretion as demonstrated by a decrease in plasma cortisol auc(0-24), relative to placebo, by 29% (95% ci 15-41) and 59% (95% ci 51-66) with 440 and 880 microg b.i.d., respectively. oral candidiasis rates were 2.5% for 320-microg/d ciclesonide, 2.4% for 640-microg/d ciclesonide, and 22.0% for 880-microg/d fluticasone propionate. the willingness of patients to use the trial drug in daily practice if efficacy would be proved was statistically significantly related to compliance during the trial (p = 0.017). fluticasone propionate aerosol was well-tolerated, and it improved some dimensions of health-related quality of life measured using a standard patient survey. the combination product significantly increased (p < or =.013) area under the curve compared with placebo and fluticasone on day 1 and compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone at week 1 and week 12. mean change from baseline in lumbar spine (l1 to l4 ) bone density at week 104 was not significantly different between fluticasone propionate (-0.006 +/- 0.008 g/cm2) and placebo (-0.007 +/- improvement in morning peak flow rate were also significantly (p < 0.001) greater with fp than with placebo (8-10% increase vs. 2% increase). values for patient-measured morning peak expiratory flow rates (pefr) were significantly (p<.05) higher and the use of rescue albuterol was significantly (p<.05) lower beginning 3 to 5 days after initiation of therapy in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate, compared with the placebo group. low-dose inhaled fp resulted in significant improvements in eno, spirometry, qol, ds, and beta2 use. bronchial responsiveness to methacholine decreased significantly only after 6 wk of treatment with fp (p < 0.05). mean morning predose percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased by 2.2%, 3.2%, and 4.6% in the fluticasone propionate, 88-, 220-, and 440-microg twice-daily, groups, respectively, compared with an 8.3% decrease for placebo (p < .001 vs placebo for all groups). two weeks of regular inhaled fluticasone discontinued 24 h before allergen challenge does not offer any additional protection against the early or late asthmatic responses, increased airway responsiveness or sputum eosinophilia compared with a single dose of 250 microg immediately before allergen challenge, despite increasing baseline pc20 and decreasing sputum eosinophilia prechallenge. patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05). both fluticasone propionate and flunisolide caused dose-dependent suppression of hpa axis, which was statistically greater for fluticasone propionate (p = 0.0003). treatment with fsc resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow compared with fp, sal, and pla (both, p < 0.001); need for rescue albuterol compared with fp and pla (p < or =0.005); and asthma symptom scores compared with pla (p < 0.001). no significant difference (p=0.39) in lower leg growth rate was found between treatment with 400 microg x day(-1) budesonide (0.30 mm x week(-1)) and 400 microg fluticasone propionate treatment (0.37 mm x week(-1)). compared to placebo, fluticasone propionate administered qd or bid significantly improved fev(1) (p < 0.001), morning (p < 0.001) and evening peak expiratory flow (pef; p < 0.001), asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.001), and albuterol use (p </= 0.001), and decreased nighttime awakenings. the increase in pd(15)fev(1) from baseline was greater in the fp group than in the placebo group; the difference achieved significance within 72 hours and remained significant until the end of treatment. fluticasone propionate powder twice daily (500 microg/day) was superior in efficacy to triamcinolone acetonide aerosol four times daily (800 microg/day) in patients with persistent asthma. the fp-treated children had significantly greater (p < or = .05) reductions in 24-hour daily asthma symptom scores (-53.9% vs -44.1%) and nighttime symptom scores over the entire treatment period compared with the placebo group. fluticasone propionate did not suppress morning plasma cortisol concentrations and did not affect 24-hour urinary free-cortisol excretion. fev1 and morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) increased during the first week of both active treatments and were stable thereafter. measurements of peak expiratory flow and symptom scores significantly improved and nighttime awakenings and albuterol use to treat symptoms significantly declined in fluticasone propionate-treated groups relative to the placebo-treated group. mean reductions from baseline in area under the plasma cortisol concentration time curves and peak cortisol concentrations were significantly (p <.05) greater with triamcinolone 400 microg twice daily compared with placebo. the numbers of t cells, macrophages, and eosinophils in the bronchial wall were reduced by two weeks of treatment with fp but were unaltered by placebo. the 2-wk treatment with fp significantly inhibited both early and late responses to allergen: the maximum % fall in fev1 during the early (0 to 2 h) and late response (2 to 6 h) was 32.6 +/- once-daily sfc significantly improved clinic forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (difference in means 0.129 l/s; p < 0.001) and clinic pef (difference in means 10.8 l/min; p < 0.001) compared with twice-daily fp. treatment of asthmatic subjects with inhaled steroids for four weeks leads to improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine, eosinophil counts in induced sputum, and exhaled nitric oxide levels. twice daily treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms was significantly more effective than theophylline in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma. fluticasone propionate produced a significantly greater increase in morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 17 l/min (95% ci; 10, 24); p < 0.001) and evening pefr (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 16 l/min (95% ci; 9, 23); p < 0.001). compared with placebo fluticasone propionate was associated with a highly significant decrease in airway responsiveness (1.9 doublings of the geometric mean pd20), which was maximal at the end of the 6-week treatment period. prednisone produced significantly greater suppression of hpa-axis function than did any of the inhaled corticosteroids or placebo (p<0.001). both significantly decreased airway responsiveness compared to placebo (p < 0.001), and also significantly increased lung function with no difference between the two active groups. no significant difference in clinical and functional data, and in sputum eosinophil percentages was observed between the beginning and the end of the study in both groups 1 and 2. the results of methacholine challenge testing averaged over all visits favored fp 200 microg/day over placebo and fp 100 microg/day (p < 0.05); there were no significant differences between placebo and fp 100 microg/day. 0.13 cm in the fluticasone propionate 100 microg group (p = 0.308, overall). finally, treatment with fsc resulted in significantly (p < or = 0.007) greater improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow, need for rescue albuterol, and asthma symptom scores compared with fp, s, and pla. treatment with fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function compared with zafirlukast (p <.05) or placebo (p <.05). serum cortisol did not change significantly in either treatment group. at

fluticasone group, significant changes occurred after 6 weeks with respect to means of pc20 (an increase of 3.4 doubling doses), plateau value fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) (from 58% at randomization to 41% at 6 weeks) and baseline fev1 (from 3.46 to 3.75 l) in contrast to the placebo group. the efficacies of fp100bid and fp200qd were comparable with regard to improvement in pulmonary function and asthma stability in bd patients. during methacholine challenge, fvc decreased less than did fev1 or v'max,50, and so did inspiratory vital capacity compared to

powder fp regimens significantly improved fev1, evening pef, and asthma symptoms at the double-blind phase endpoint (p < or = .017 compared with placebo). at all time points, hpa axis function was similar in the 88-microg fluticasone group compared with the placebo group. the effects of the inhaled glucocorticosteroid fluticasone propionate (fp) on the bronchial responsiveness to nka and methacholine were studied. morning and evening peak expiratory flow (pef), asthma symptoms, and supplemental albuterol use also improved in all fluticasone propionate groups versus placebo.

with screening recommendations, except that referrals from nbwhp were more likely (p less than 0.01) to have had a pap test and breast self-examination, while residents of public housing projects were somewhat less likely to have done so. we conclude that mailed psychoeducational materials may be an effective mechanism to improve adherence among women with abnormal mammogram results. we recommend the use of patient reminder letters as a first step in a mammography or pap smear screening outreach program. a mammogram was obtained by 33% of women in group 1, 37% of women in group 2, and 57% of women in group 3. a randomized controlled study that evaluated a recall system and patient education material by mail in 178 asymptomatic female family practice patients aged 50 to 69 years showed no effect on the proportion of patients who had cancer screening tests (p = .20) and a significant adverse effect on the mean number of tests performed (p = .05) after 4 months. the most dramatic difference was in the higher odds that women in the intervention group would obtain a mammogram within 2 months (odds ratio = 10.5). age and other risk factors for breast cancer were unrelated to attendance, as was the distance between home and the screening centre. overall 33 per cent of women (53 of 163) who were sent invitations attended for screening compared to 9 per cent of those not invited (7 of 80) (p less than 0.001). an attendance of 38 per cent was obtained for women whose gp chose to send a letter with an appointment compared to 24 per cent for women whose gp chose to send

progressive disease/pd 28%; 95% confidence internal/95% ci 27-58) and of lv5-fu2-cddp was 25% (pr 25%, sd 36%, pd 39%; 95% ci 14-41; p =0.013). docetaxel based treatment (tcf) showed better palliation and improvement of global qol as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ecf). none of the three drug combinations showed a significant advantage over 5-fu alone in improved performance score, weight gain, or patient survival. significantly higher survival rates were demonstrated in those patients with recurrent cancers (p < 0.01) and those who responded to the fpepir regimen (p < 0.05). hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity were mild with both regimens. the median progression-free survival of all patients in the hd-fu, hd-fu/fa, and hd-fu/fa/cis arm was 1.9, 4.0, and 6.1 months, respectively. the improved survival was observed despite decreased 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin dosages for patients on the fat and fap arms. median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 3.2 months (95% ci, 1.8 to 4.6 months) and 6.8 months (95% ci, 2.6 to 11.1 months) with lv5fu2, respectively; 4.9 months (95% ci, 3.5 to 6.3 months) and 9.5 months (95% ci, 6.9 to 12.2 months) with lv5fu2-cisplatin, respectively; and 6.9 months (95% ci, 5.5 to 8.3 months) and 11.3 months (95% ci, 9.3 to 13.3 months) with lv5fu2-irinotecan, respectively. the survival rates after 12 months (30.8% versus 22.4%) and 24 months (15.7% versus 9.5%) were also higher among patients receiving pelf, but these differences were not statistically significant. forty-eight patients with unresectable gastric cancer were enrolled for a randomized trial of fp (n = 24) vs fep (n = 24) combination chemotherapy with respect to their effects on survival period. median overall survival was 10.5 versus 9.3 months for xp versus fp (unadjusted hr = 0.85, 95% ci 0.64-1.13, p = 0.008 versus noninferiority margin of 1.25). orr was 25.0% (95% ci, 13% to 41%) for ecf, 18.5% (95% ci, 9% to 34%) for tc, and 36.6% (95% ci, 23% to 53%) for tcf (n = 119). frequency and grade of the side effects were not significantly different between a and b group. the overall response rates (complete responses [crs] and partial responses [prs]) were 15% and 43% for the fam and the pelf regimens, respectively, with a statistically significant advantage for the experimental treatment (p = .001). ttp for if was 5.0 months [95% confidence interval (ci) 3.8-5.8] and 4.2 months (95% ci 3.7-5.5) for cf (p = 0.088). with regard to toxicity, the fam regimen produced more anorexia, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and cumulative bone marrow suppression. for ilf and elf, respectively, median progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months, time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (p = 0.4542), and overall survival was 10.8 vs 8.3 months (p = 0.2818). duration of response and survival were significantly longer for fab in the measurable-disease group, but for the total patient population an early advantage for fab in time to disease progression and survival was lost with continued follow-up. grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was observed in 9% of patients in the fe group and in 13% of patients in the fep group, with 6 cases of febrile neutropenia (fe, 4%; fep, 7%). although fp demonstrated a higher response rate (p <.001) and longer progression-free survival than did fu alone (p <.001), no differences in overall survival were observed between the arms. the median overall survival time of the treated group was 9 months, whereas that of the control group was only 3 months (p = 0.001). there were no significant differences in all eligible patients with respect to time to progression or overall survival in the three treatment arms. toxicity was rarely severe. the incidence of toxicities (leukopenia in particular) exceeding jcog grade 3 was significantly higher for group a, but no morbidity was observed. overall survival was longer with dcf versus cf (23% risk reduction; log-rank p = .02). the most frequent world health organization grade 3-4 toxic effects were gastrointestinal in study a and hematologic in study b. no treatment-related death was observed. median overall survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to s-1 plus cisplatin (13.0 months [iqr 7.6-21.9]) than in those assigned to s-1 alone (11.0 months [5.6-19.8]; hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% ci 0.61-0.98; p=0.04). similarly, the femtx group displayed significantly (p = 0.0006) prolonged survival compared with the control group, i.e. median survival 12.3 months (95% ci 7.1-15.6 months) vs 3.1 months (95% ci 1.6-4.6 months). median survival was 9.4 months with ecf and 8.7 months with mcf (p =.315); at 1 year, 40.2% (95% ci, 34% to 46%) of ecf and 32.7% (95% ci, 27% to 38%) of mcf patients were alive. responder patients showed a significantly better median survival duration than nonresponders (p = .01); in arm b the median survival duration was 16 months for responder patients in contrast to 7 months for nonresponders (p = .004). the median duration of objective remission (31 vs 40 weeks) was longer using bafmi combination, and the median duration of survival, calculated in the 85 randomized patients, was slightly longer using 5-fu (28 vs 24 weeks). however, in patients older than 65 years (n = 94), treatment with flo resulted in significantly superior response rates (41.3% v 16.7%; p = .012), time to treatment failure (5.4 v 2.3 months; p < .001), and pfs (6.0 v 3.1 month; p = .029) and an improved os (13.9 v 7.2 months) as compared with flp, respectively. the global ql scores were better for ecf at 24 weeks, but the remaining ql data showed no differences between either arm of the study. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients

significant tachyphylaxis (p < 0.05) to protection against methacholine challenge when comparing first/last dose (as geometric mean protection ratio versus baseline): morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were more improved with formoterol, and formoterol provided significantly greater improvements in asthma symptom scores compared with both albuterol and placebo. no changes in the beta-adrenoceptor density on mnl and no significant side effects were seen throughout the trial period. formoterol turbuhaler, 12 microg bid, was more effective than terbutaline turbuhaler, 0.5 mg qid, and placebo. f was better than t (p = 0.014) and p (p = 0.0001) in improving morning pef compared with albuterol, salmeterol treatment was associated with better morning and mean peak expiratory flow (p = 0.013 and 0.016, respectively), less daytime and nocturnal symptoms (p = 0.008 and 0.01, respectively), reduced requirement of rescue albuterol (p = 0.04), and better efficacy rating by patients (p = 0.04). the tolerability of each drug, as reflected by adverse reactions and global assessment, was equally good in both groups. the bronchodilating effect of formoterol, assessed by morning premedication pefr, was significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.0001) and salbutamol (p < 0.0001). the sm group had significantly more symptom-free nights than the sb group (p < 0.001), and also more "rescue-free" nights (p = 0.04). morning fev1 30 min postdrug was significantly higher in the formoterol group at weeks 2 and 8, the trend not reaching statistical significance at other times. significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow, percentage of nights without awakening, and asthma symptoms were observed with salmeterol. treatment over 16 weeks with either salmeterol or salbutamol was not associated with an incidence of deaths related to asthma in excess of that predicted. all three treatments improved asthma control, morning and evening pef rates, and spirometric indices with no change in bronchial hyperreactivity. significant improvements with salmeterol by comparison with terbutaline were also observed in daytime and night-time asthma scores, percentage of symptom-free days and nights, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and percentage of days and nights when no additional inhaled bronchodilator was needed.(abstract truncated at 250 words) throughout the first three month treatment period, both morning and evening pefr were significantly higher on treatment with salmeterol than salbutamol (mean differences between the treatments 30 l.min-1 for morning, p < 0.001, and 11 l.min-1 for evening, p < 0.01). relative to placebo, the mean morning pefr increased by 30 l/min (95% ci 26 to 35) for salmeterol but did not change for salbutamol. the mean overall symptom score was improved most by salmeterol treatment (p < 0.05), with the number of days with symptoms and of nights with awakenings decreasing by 22 percent and 52 percent, respectively; there were no differences in results between albuterol treatment and placebo administration. except for the aqlq, the correlation between change in lung function and change in quality of life was generally low. there were no statistically significant changes in fev1 or ar between the run-in period and any of the post treatment measurements for either of the treatments used. asthma-specific quality of life, both overall and for the individual domains (activity limitation, symptoms, emotional function, and exposure to environmental stimuli) was better with salmeterol than with placebo (p < 0.0001), and better with salmeterol than with salbutamol (p < 0.001). salmeterol produced a significantly higher mean morning pef (mean difference compared with salbutamol 21 (95% ci 12-31) l/min), and a significant reduction in mean diurnal variation in pef (from 30 l/min at baseline to 11 34 l/min at baseline to 32 l/min during salbutamol treatment). sb was more effective than p in increasing evening pef and the percentage of symptom-free days (p < 0.05) and rescue-free days (p < 0.0001). treatment with salmeterol twice daily produced significantly greater improvements from baseline in all quality of life domain ("activity limitation," "asthma symptoms," "emotional function," "environmental exposure") scores and in the global aqlq score at 12 weeks (p < or = .038) compared with albuterol treatment four times daily. a single morning dose of salmeterol produced improvement in fev1 that was significantly greater (p < or = 0.012) than that produced by two doses of salbutamol (taken 6 hours apart) when patients were assessed 3 to 6 hours and 10 to 12 hours after the dose. our results showed that in the run-in period there were not

no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures ao/ota 31-a1 and a2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome. mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. there were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups. internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing. there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the euroqol 5d outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures. there were no significant differences in functional outcome between the pfna and the dhs groups. we found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. there was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of wound complications in the patients treated by the gamma nail. the two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand. decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). we found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. the ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the pfn group compared to the msp group with an odds ratio 2.2 (p = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). according to our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old. at an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.-- the mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw. postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. the mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the holland nail group (dhs 4.3 days, the intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001). there was no difference in the rates of cutting-out of the two implants but use of the küntscher-y nail was associated with a greater incidence of shortening. no differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality. peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. there were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the gamma nail group. patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. any potential for the tgn leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. more intra-operative complications were recorded in the gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of chinese people. clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. the reduction in the hrqol (eq-5d(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the gamma nail group (2%) and none in the richard's group (p = 0.13). there was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. the operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for dhs implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 206 patients into two study groups: those treated

the most important determinant of relapse was duration of illness prior to starting neuroleptic medication. the estimated 26-week risk of recurrence was six times lower for zotepine than placebo (8.7% versus 52.8%; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% ci 0.053, 0.484; p<0.001). among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol. the data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis. these patients showed a significantly higher relapse rate than the matched control group of 26 patients who continued to receive fluphenazine (56% versus 19%, p less than .001). at the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. mean fluphenazine levels between drug continuation and withdrawal conditions showed a progressively larger difference over time, although significant differences were not seen until week 8. time to relapse was significantly longer in quetiapine xr-treated patients versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.16 long-term treatment with asenapine was more effective than placebo in preventing relapse of schizophrenia and appeared to be safe and well tolerated. relapse was accompanied by a resurgence of specifically schizophrenic symptoms and by an increase in abnormalities described by the relatives. propericiazine at 10 mg and 30 mg also increased the number of symptom-free days dose-dependently but at 60 mg, the number decreased. the olanzapine group had a significantly longer time to relapse (p < 0.0001) than the placebo group. ziprasidone treatment was indistinguishable from placebo in assessments of movement disorders and was not associated with weight gain or cardiovascular abnormalities. drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse and readmission to hospital. time-to-relapse (primary endpoint) favored paliperidone palmitate (p<0.0001, log-rank test) at interim and final analysis (n=408). a poor outcome at 2 years was associated with male sex, poor outcome after the first 5 weeks of the first admission, negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission, and a diagnosis of definite or probable schizophrenia using the feighner criteria. evaluation of the results showed no significant differences between the two groups or between the baseline and the final ratings in each group. aripiprazole was significantly superior to placebo from baseline to endpoint in panss total, panss positive, panss-derived brief psychiatric rating scale, and clinical global impressions-severity of illness scale (cgi-s) scores and demonstrated significantly better mean clinical global impressions-global improvement scale scores (p < or = .01 for all comparisons except cgi-s: although quetiapine was generally well tolerated, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse or serious adverse events was greater in the quetiapine group (18%;

p = 0.001). the sws was equally effective with or without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (p = 0.73 for interaction), and together they reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (irr = 0.33, 95% ci = 0.24-0.46, p < 0.0001), days with diarrhea by 54% (irr = 0.46, 95% ci = 0.32-0.66, p < 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea by 47% (irr = 0.53, 95% ci = 0.34-0.83, p < 0.0056). both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer. this intervention is a useful tool for preventing waterborne diseases in families in developing countries who lack access to potable water. among the 108 children in households allocated solar treatment, diarrhoea was reported in 439 of the 2-week reporting periods during the 12-week trial (average 4.1 [sd 1.2] per child). children drinking solar disinfected water had a significantly lower risk of severe diarrhoeal disease over 8705 two weekly follow up visits; two week period prevalence was 48.8% compared with 58.1% in controls, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 16.0%. the results show a 50% reduction of the incidence rate of diarrhoea and a 85% reduction of the proportion of deaths related to diarrhoea in the villages with intervention. annual incidence of diarrhoea in 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size. water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics. water in homes was contaminated (43.4%) with more than 1100 total coliforms/100 ml due to the use of unclean utensils to transport and store water. an intervention trial with comprehensive prevention and control for diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of east fujian, china during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health. the home chlorination intervention group had the lowest diarrheal rate (28.8/1,000 subjects/month) despite lack of access to piped water in their homes. analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (p = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket. in this study area, under non-epidemic conditions, the reduction of faecal bacteria in the public drinking-water supply by chlorination does not seem to be a priority intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea. for children less than five years old, the reduction in risk was 83% (95% ci = 51-94%;

(nausea and headache) occurred at a similar rate for patients in both treatment groups. the study completion, therapy participation, and medication compliance rates in the trial were high, with no differences between treatment groups. interactions were observed between medication group assignment and both craving level prior to randomization (p = .02) and family loading of alcohol problems (p = .05). medication interactions were found for cocaine use via urine drug screens (three way, with time) and self-reports (two way) for drug severity (two way) and alcohol use (two way). intent-to-treat analyses suggested that there was no overall efficacy of naltrexone and no medication by psychosocial intervention interaction. there were no differences in the frequency of any self-reported adverse effects or in liver enzyme values between the placebo- and naltrexone-treated groups. on an intention-to-treat basis, the kaplan-meier survival curve showed a clear advantage in relapse rates for naltrexone over placebo (log-rank test, chi(2)(1) = naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% ci, 0.53-0.98; p = .02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not cbi. naltrexone treatment response was significant within the group of 75 individuals who were homozygous for oprm1 asn40 allele. naltrexone was not better than placebo in the supportive groups, but it had a significant effect in the coping groups: 27% of the coping/naltrexone patients had no relapses to heavy drinking throughout the 32 weeks, compared with only 3% of the coping/placebo patients. there were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate. naltrexone showed trends (p < 0.10) toward a greater decrease in drinking days (binary outcome), alcohol craving, and some liver enzyme levels than placebo. more patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated patients. although more subjects in the active medication groups terminated the study early secondary to adverse events, the rates did not differ significantly from that of placebo. subjects treated with an active medication had significantly more consecutive weeks of abstinence and less craving than those treated with placebo, but there were no significant group differences in other measures of alcohol consumption. patients treated with nalmefene also had fewer subsequent relapses (p<.03) than patients given placebo. the survival function showed that patients treated with aripiprazole remained abstinent from any alcohol amount for a longer time with respect to those treated with naltrexone. participants in any of the randomized groups who were entry abstainers had significantly better improvement on all of the primary outcome measures. although subjects in both groups reduced their consumption of both alcohol and cocaine during the 8-week trial, there was no consistent advantage to ntx over placebo treatment. overall, naltrexone showed only modest effects in reducing alcohol drinking for the 12 weeks of treatment. drinking reductions at 3, 6, and 12 months correlated with more use of coping skills, lower urge, and higher self-efficacy. the active medication group showed better medication compliance, while the number of adverse events was low overall and not significantly different by group. naltrexone depot subjects also had significantly fewer drinking days during treatment and a significantly greater abstinence rate than the placebo group (18% vs. 10%). the relapse rates between the two groups were not significant (p = 0.671). rates of cocaine use and drinks per day did not differ between treatment groups; however naltrexone did reduce frequency of heavy drinking days, as did cbt without cm. long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy. naltrexone treated patients had significantly fewer drinking days, heavy drinking days (>5 drinks) and reported less craving compared to the placebo treated patients. compared with placebo, the srp of ntx significantly reduced the frequency of heavy drinking days during the injection and follow-up periods. there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the outcome variables at baseline or follow up measurements. also, there were no significant differences between the study groups concerning secondary effectiveness measures as well as compliance and adverse clinical events--with the exception of the gamma-gt, which was significantly greater reduced in the naltrexone group throughout the study. the overall results are encouraging; 42% of the subjects had a remission of their depression and had no drinking relapses during the trial. these results are supported by the lower levels of liver enzyme activities (p < 0.010 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase), but not by the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin levels, in the naltrexone group. naltrexone treatment was associated with significantly more adverse neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal effects, poorer compliance, and a greater rate of treatment attrition. the combined medication was most effective with significantly lower relapse rates than placebo and acamprosate but not naltrexone. naltrexone was well tolerated and there were few adverse experiences. the median reduction from baseline of serum ggt (p: < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (obsessive and compulsive drinking scale: ocds) were greater in the naltrexone group (p: < 0.05), from approximately half-way through the study. among those with eating disturbances, symptoms of eating pathology improved during treatment, but the effects did not differ according to medication condition. differential treatment effects were identified after stratification according to scores on the alcohol dependence scale (ads) and depression anxiety and stress scale (dass). our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence. individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of beta-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in beta-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. subjects taking naltrexone reported significantly less alcohol craving and days in which any alcohol was consumed. the 40 mg group had a significantly lower rate of relapse (p < or = 0.05), and a greater increase in the number of abstinent days/week (p < or = 0.09), than the other treatment groups. however, the cbt-naltrexone group did better than the other groups on a variety of outcome measures. naltrexone seemed to reduce relapse rate to heavy drinking, but we found no differences in other alcohol consumption variables between naltrexone- and placebo-treated groups. naltrexone proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems, including abstention rates, number of drinking days, relapse, and severity of alcohol-related problems. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 164 patients (n = 116 men and n = 48 women) with co-occurring cocaine and alcohol dependence subjects were enrolled

depressions in resting metabolism or fat oxidation rates (ie, resting or postprandial) that had occurred as a consequence of the prior weight loss. increase in one-repetition maximum leg press strength averaged 17.2% with testosterone alone, 17.4% with resistance training alone, and 26.8% with testosterone + resistance training (p < 0.001). in re the following improved (p < 0.05): training did not induce changes in pbmc subsets, interleukin (il)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf), il-6, il-2, or pge2 production, lymphocyte proliferation, or dth response in any of the training groups, compared with control subjects. the experimental group significantly increased in all strength measures, while the control group increased in only right leg flexion and left leg extension across the training period. muscle strength increased significantly in both the rhgh/exercise (+55.6%, p =.0004) as well as the exercise alone (+47.8%, p =.0005) mean tug results from the pre-test were significantly lower than mean results from post-test. the combined strength and treadmill training program and treadmill training after 12 weeks of strength training resulted in increases in peak exercise performance similar to those observed with 12 weeks of treadmill training alone. exercise increased fsr of mhc by 47% (p < 0.01) and mixed muscle protein by 56% (p < 0.05). the 12-week resistance exercise intervention did not improve body composition as measured by changes in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, or subcutaneous skinfolds. all three types of group-based exercise programs significantly reduced back pain and its related disabilities, but only resistance and agility training significantly improved health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older women with low bone mass. the effect of resistance training was significant (manova f = 21.1, p < 0.001), but balance training did not improve strength, and there was no interaction (positive or negative) between balance and resistive training. moderate-intensity resistance exercise training in chf patients produced favorable changes to skeletal muscle strength and endurance, vo(2peak), fbf, and hrv. by weeks 12 and 18, all training groups were significantly stronger than controls (p < 0.01). significant strength improvements (p<0.05), ranging between 197 and 285%, were recorded in the experimental group. at six months there was a trend for the prt intervention group to have lower gds scores than the comparison group, but this finding did not reach significance (p = 0.08). the results showed a trend towards improvement in both the exercise groups in both sit to stand and timed get up and go tests, but this failed to attain statistical significance. resistance training led to improved measures for domains of upper body strength (+18 vs. +6%), lower body strength (+23 vs. +6%), endurance (+26 vs. +1%), balance and coordination (+29 vs. -2%), and 6-min walk (+15 vs. +7%). maximal strength was significantly greater for the st group than for the c group (p =.015) after the intervention. mean electromyogram signal amplitude of vastus lateralis was larger in the strength-training than in the standard-rehabilitation group at 5 and 12 wk (p < 0.05). at 3 months, no difference in mean change in hrqol and physical activity scores was seen between the groups, except for an increased sf-36 physical functioning score for the resistance group compared with the control group (p = 0.019) and the function group (p = 0.046). both treatment groups showed significant strength gains (p < .05), which occurred over a wider velocity spectrum for the exercise group. individual changes in ke torque/body mass before and after 18 weeks of training averaged 19.1% in the strength group, 30.9% in the endurance group and 2.0% in the controls. change in aggregate functional performance score (the sum of 4 functional performance test scores) did not differ between the four intervention groups nor with high-intensity prmst compared with low-resistance exercise (7 +/- high intensity prt is more effective than is low intensity prt or gp care for the treatment of older depressed patients. performance measurements included 1rm lower-body strength, chair-rising time, walking velocity, stair-climbing time, and flexibility. training altered the angle-torque relation: (a) displacing it by 9-31% towards higher torque values (p < 0.05); and (b) shifting the optimal angle from 70 deg (corresponding torque: 121.4 +/- increases in muscle strength of the weight trainers were significant for all seven exercises (5%-65%), with the greatest gains in the shoulder and trunk muscles. high intensity, home based strength training can produce substantial improvements in strength, pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee oa. there was a significant overall impact across the four measures of the exercise intervention (p = 0.013). training resulted in a significant increase in vo2max in the et (+7.4%, p = 0.005) group only. all three training groups demonstrated an increase in peak isometric and isokinetic concentric and eccentric strength following 12 weeks of training (p <.01). strength increased by 18% (p < 0.005) in five out of seven exercises in the training group, but was unchanged in the control group. there was no effect of either intervention on physical health or falls, but patients in the exercise group were at increased risk of musculoskeletal injury (risk ratio = 3.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-8.0). between 7 and 18 months after randomization, control subjects had more outpatient clinic visits (p < .06) and were more likely to sustain hospital costs over $5000 (p < .05). all training groups significantly increased force, power, and functional abilities (maximal treadmill walking speed, vertical jumping, and box stepping) at week 8 (in the range from 6.5 to 20.8%) with no further improvement at week 16 (except maximal treadmill walking speed), but no significant differences were observed between the three groups. similarly, muscle endurance gains were greater for the 3-set than the 1-set group (p<.01), with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and isometric knee extensor strength. the training program improved muscle strength but did not affect plasma levels of tnf-alpha and stnfr-i or il-6. 21%) in skeletal muscle were independently predictive of improved 6-min walk distance (r2 = 0.78; p = 0.0024). the strength training program was very effective in improving strength in pf (+24.5%), and it thus reduced the df-to-pf mvc torque ratio; in addition, it also induced gains in df (+7.6%). resistance training resulted in significant (p<0.05) increases in repetition maximums across all exercises (range 41-78%). the coefficient of variation (cv) for force during submaximal isometric contractions did not change with training for any group. manova repeated measures revealed that the hi group demonstrated the most strength gains following a speed specificity pattern (most considerable improvement occurred at or near slow speeds from 7.3% to 11.2% for male and from 2.3% to 15.2% for female). rt induced a 37% reduction in shortening fluctuations at 5% of mvc and 35% reduction in lengthening fluctuations at both 30% and 65% of mvc. at posttest the exercisers demonstrated slower gait velocity, enhanced balance, and an improved ability to walk backward, although none of these posttest measures was significantly different from the control group. only the rt group exhibited change in structural properties: a rise in mitochondrial volume density (31%) and muscle size (10%). muscle biopsies (n = 20) taken at the start and after the first 11 weeks of training showed a significant increase in the area of both type 1 and type 2 fibers in the biceps brachii muscle and a positive significant correlation between the percentage increase in the proportional area of type 2 fibers in the vastus lateralis muscle and the percentage increase in knee extension dynamic muscle strength. there was no significant effect of either exercise program on thigh tissue composition, except for bmd at the 1/3 site (middle third of the femur), where lo and co groups experienced a decline (p < 0.05) of -2.2 +/- 0.5% and -1.8 +/- in comparison to control group, invest group manifested significant improvements (p<.05) in leg power across measurements obtained at 75% to 90% of the one-repetition maximum. increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. bone mineral density (bmd) of the femoral neck significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 1.96% for the hex group. relative to controls, subjects who participated in the program achieved statistically significant lower extremity strength improvements of 6% to 12%, a 20% improvement in tandem gait, and a 15% to 18% reduction in physical and overall disability at the 6-month follow-up. the cross-sectional areas of the knee extensors increased significantly by 5.5% in ex but were unchanged in con. all exercise treatment groups revealed lower resting heart rate and rate-pressure product; lower exercise diastolic blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion; increased gxt duration; increased leg, back, and shoulder 5rm scores; and improved aahperd flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance scores. peak oxygen uptake increased from 18.1 to 19.7 ml x kg(-1) upper and lower extremity strength were significantly higher after 12 weeks of st or comt with no change after at or nt. both groups significantly improved their combined lower-extremity strength (hip abduction, ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, ankle plantarflexion, and knee extension) (p = 0.003), but no statistical difference between the st and ft group gains (p = 0.203) was found. stren improved significantly in chest press and leg extension strength (p less than or equal to 0.05) while w/j and cont showed no change. although lp and ke 1rm muscle strength increased similarly in both groups asa result of the training (p < .001), lp peak power increased significantly more in hi than in lo (267 w vs 139 w, p < .001). peak muscle power may be improved similarly using light, moderate, or heavy resistances, whereas there is a dose-response relationship between training intensity and muscle strength and endurance changes. results revealed significant increases in three major muscles compared to the control group. neither group showed a change in peak aerobic capacity or in whole-body composition, although fat-free mass of the leg increased in the exercise group. in the isometric group, time to perform all 4 functional tasks decreased (p<.05) by 16% to 23%. isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. st and sa increased significantly (p < 0.05) sit-and-reach performance, elbow flexion, knee flexion, shoulder flexion and extension and hip flexion and extension both at mid- and post-training. the hydrotherapy group increased left quadriceps strength only at follow up, and this was significantly different from the control group. older male exercisers achieved significant differences relative to controls in perceived anger, tension, and overall social functioning. there were no significant differences between s- and se-induced muscle hypertrophy (11% and 11%) and maximal strength (41% and 38%) gains of the legs as well as between e- and se-induced wmax (28% and 23%) gains. vo2peak was increased after both rt and at (p < 0.05). in single fibers, no changes in size and contractility were noted after 2 weeks, but specific force was higher in the training group after 12 weeks. in these, handgrip strength improved more in those given additional exercise than conventional physiotherapy (2.1 kg versus -0.3 kg, p < 0.05). improvement in muscle strength was significantly greater with resistance training (32% +/- there was a significant interaction of testosterone and exercise on quality of life in the domains of physical functioning (p = 0.03), role physical (p = 0.01), general health (p = 0.049), and social functioning (p = 0.04). quality of life subscales of bodily pain (p = .001), vitality (p = .002), social functioning (p = .008), and role emotional (p = .02) were all significantly improved by exercise compared to controls. following the training, the resistance group exhibited improved ankle dorsiflexion, training resistances, and gait velocity, but showed no change in plantar flexion or postural control. both triglycerides and the total cholesterol to hdl ratio increased significantly while total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and ldl cholesterol remained unchanged. ke strength and endurance, stair-climbing power, and chair-rising time improved significantly in the hi and li groups compared with the pc group. muscle mass, muscle strength, and dynamic balance increased in the strength-trained women and decreased in the controls (p = .03 to < .001). the impact of strength gain on chair rise performance was significant in participants who were more impaired (p = .04). progressive resistance exercise can produce substantial increases in muscle strength and in power standardized for body weight in healthy, very old women. no changes were found in the control group, except for decreased peak oxygen uptake (p<0.02) and quality of life scores (p<0.03). no significant group, exercise time, or training effects were found for cd3+, cd3+cd4+, or cd3+cd8+ cells, but there was a significant exercise time effect for cd3-cd16+cd56+ cells. analysis of covariance indicated that all three exercise intervention groups significantly improved measures of functional ability, with the resistance group demonstrating the most consistent gains over the six measures. older disabled persons with osteoarthritis of the knee had modest improvements in measures of disability, physical performance, and pain from participating in either an aerobic or a resistance exercise program. both exercise groups showed significant improvements relative to control group in upper and lower body strength, shoulder flexibility, and agility and balance exercise. statistical analyses (analysis of covariance) showed significant strength gains (p < 0.01) in bilateral bench press (> 29%), bilateral leg press (> 19%), and unilateral biceps curl (> 20%). responses to a chronic respiratory questionnaire showed significant improvements in dyspnoea and mastery of daily living activities in the trained group. single-repetition maximum strength significantly improved in the prt group for lp (16.2%), paretic ke (31.4%), and nonparetic ke (38.2%) with no change in the control group. there were significant increases in type i and type ii fiber areas, and capillary density also increased significantly in the training group. rt was not associated with changes in lv cavity size, wall thickness, mass, or systolic function after 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of exercise. significant increases were found in the ex group for eccentric (44%) and concentric (60%) average power (p < 0.05), and improvements were seen on each functional test: the 8-foot up-and-go, chair stand, and walk time improved by 31%, 66%, and 33%, respectively (p < 0.05). fr (p< 0.01) and per (p< 0.01) groups experienced significant strength gains compared to c but were not different from each other. for each of the eight exercises, muscle strength increased in the exercise groups relative to co (p < .01), with no difference among ex1, ex2 and ex3 groups at any measurement interval. there was a group and time effect as the ex group increased 31.4% (p <.001) in strength for all muscle groups after the first 6 months of training, and the strength gains were retained for the duration of the training intervention. stair-climbing power also improved in the exercisers as compared with the nonexercisers (by 28.4 +/- baseline cortisol concentration (p < 0.01), cd20+ cell count (p < 0.05), cd3+ cell count (p < 0.05), and cd4+ cell count (p < 0.01) decreased in both groups secondary to circannual variations between winter and summer. those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (p= 0.029). no significant interaction was observed between time and group and therefore no difference in strength changes between training once a week versus twice a week after 9 weeks. progressive resistance training had a greater effect than flexibility training on right sided quadriceps strength (mean difference between groups = 7.7%; 95% ci 3.6-11.8%, p < 0.003 manova), left sided quadriceps strength (mean difference = 9.9%; 95% ci 5.6-14.2%, p < 0.003 manova), left sided biceps strength (mean difference = 15.2%; 95% ci 11.7-19.2%, p < 0.003 manova), functional reach (mean difference = 11.7%; 95% ci 7.1-16.3%, p < 0.003 manova) and step test (mean difference = 8.6%; 95% ci 3.8-13.4%, p < 0.003 manova). resistance training that consisted of two training sessions per week was found to be at least as efficient as resistance training that included three training sessions per week, provided that the number of sets performed were equal. serum crp levels were reduced in subjects undergoing resistance training (-1.7 mg/l) compared with controls (1.5 mg/l; p = 0.05). strength improved 22% in the power-trained individuals and 12% in the walkers (p <.0001). although low intensity training improved (p<0.05) strength (42-66%), anaerobic power (10%), and mobility (5-7%), high intensity training elicited greater (p<0.05) gains (63-91% in strength, 17-25% in anaerobic power, 9-14% in mobility). compared with rom, st decreased the mean rate of joint space narrowing (jsn) in osteoarthritic knees by 26% (p = not significant). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> healthy older men healthy, community-dwelling elderly persons frail older adults elderly women remain unclear relatively healthy

was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (p = 0.53). the self-care knowledge of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (f = 11.569, p = 0.001). total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. there were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of patients re-admitted to hospital between baseline and 3 months or 3 and 6 months. the mtc intervention reduced the mean length of stay by 1.97 days (p less than

were not significantly different between the transition and usual care groups. patients in the intervention group had 2.1 fewer days of hospitalization, but this shorter length of stay was not statistically significant (p = 0.108). a nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure. patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care improved significantly faster between 4 and 12 weeks (median change in barthel activities of daily living index 6 versus 2; p<0.01) and had higher quality of life scores at 12 weeks (65 versus 59; p=0.07) and 6 months (72 versus 63; p<0.005). from the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. those patients receiving early, systematic discharge planning experienced an increased likelihood of successful return to home after hospital admission and a decreased chance of unscheduled readmission for the 9-month study period. a low-cost discharge-transfer intervention may improve the rates of outpatient follow-up and of completed workups after hospital discharge. three patients from the control group were discharged to residential institutions as compared with none in the intervention the 90-day readmission rate was 33.3% (21.7%-44.9%) for the patients receiving the study intervention (n = 63) compared with 45.7% (29.2%-62.2%) for the control patients (n = 35). this intervention was effective in reducing rehospitalizations and ed visits for very elderly participants 3 but not 6 months after their discharge from the agu. the intervention was most effective among participants with hospital utilization in the 6 months before index admission (p = 0.014). length of stay showed no difference between groups. the intervention group patients, when compared with control patients, had a significant reduction (p = 0.005) in drug mismatch between drugs prescribed at discharge and taken at home, and had a greater knowledge of their drug regimen 10-14 days after discharge (p < 0.001). during the follow-up period, the rate of falls, hospitalization for falls, institutionalization, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. in hospital a, the cases (n = 421) referred for early discharge planning had significantly shorter length of stay (mantel-cox, p = 0.03) than controls

<punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> during the observation period, spontaneous labor occurred in a significantly greater percentage of patients in the treatment group (27%) than in the control group (2%). contrary to current opinion, intracervical dinoprostone gel does not appreciably lower the cesarean section rate when used at this dose and route before labor is induced. minprostin gel (group i) and minprostin tablets (group ii) were equally effective in ripening the cervix. there were four failures of induction of labor in group 2 and none in group 1 (p < 0.05). uterine hyperstimulation and perinatal outcome were similar in both groups. twenty-three of 30 treated patients had uterine contractions lasting greater than four hours and eight patients delivered during the observation period. dinoprostone vaginal insert is more efficient than cervical gel in promoting cervical priming and labor induction in low-bishop-score patients at term. compared to control subjects, patients in the group given prepidil had significant increases in cervical bishop scores, shorter induction-to-delivery intervals, lower maximum doses of oxytocin, and fewer days of induction. no difference was demonstrated in mean time to delivery, 28.3 versus 24.0 hours (p = .19) or percent requiring cesarean section. adverse perinatal outcome in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies of > or = 41 weeks is very low with either of the management schemes described. there were no significant differences in relation to cesarean delivery rate, apgar scores at 5 minutes, and arterial umbilical cord ph, although the power of our study was limited to detect differences in proportions of adverse outcomes. the pge2 pessary appears to be more effective with 68% of patients either going into labour during cervical ripening or succeeding in the cervical ripening compared to around 50% in the atad and pge2 gel groups. cervical state did not change significantly (bishop score 3.6 and 4.0) after 24 hours in patients receiving placebo gel. no serious adverse reactions were observed. in the three groups no differences were observed among 128 subjects in the weekly bishop scores, cervical dilatation or gestational age upon admission to the labor and delivery suite, the percentage of patients presenting with spontaneous labor or ruptured membranes, the number of post-date inductions or neonatal outcome. the 2 mg intravaginal gel and the 0.5 mg intracervical gel were equally effective and more effective than the 1 mg intravaginal gel in labor characteristics such as ripening time and cesarean section rate, but not in labor time. gastrointestinal side effects were registered after intravaginal but not after intracervical application. since signs of myometrial hypercontractility were observed in the pge2 treated group as compared to the control group (p = 0.01), the authors advocate careful cardiotocographic monitoring for at least three hours after the gel application. overall success, defined as a progression in bishop score of at least 3 points within 12 hours, was achieved in 22/40 (55%) of the gel group, 15/41 (37%) in the tablet treated women, and 8/40 (20%) in those receiving placebo. there were no significant differences in the number of antepartum tests, labor inductions, or cesarean sections, the maximum oxytocin dosage, or the interval from admission to delivery in the prostaglandin e2 gel and placebo gel groups (n = 90). the results obtained showed a significant increase in bishop's score 12 hours after cervical ripening, irrespective of the way pge2 was administered: from 2.3 +/- the median interval to delivery was significantly shorter in the pge2 group, at 2.5 days, compared with placebo, at 7 days (p = .02). in addition the induction-delivery interval was shortened (median times 9.0 h vs. 11.3 h) and fewer cesarean sections were performed (16% vs. 21%) in the pge2 gel series. as estimated by life table analysis, the pessaries were significantly more effective inducing vaginal delivery compared to intracervical gel (24 h: p less than 0.025, 48 h: p less than 0.01, logrank test) and vaginal delivery was obtained within 24 h/48 h in 50%/72% of the women in the pessary group and in 29%/55% of the women in the intracervical group. there was also no difference in cesarean delivery rate, antepartum fever, hyperstimulation, apgar scores, birth weight, or umbilical artery ph. intracervical administration of dinoprostone with prelabor rupture of membrane at term and unripened cervix shortens the interval to delivery without a significant increase of maternal or neonatal morbidity. bishop scores were altered in all patients not proceeding to labor spontaneously, but the changes were most significant in the low- and high-dose groups. our results show that intracervical pge2 gel seems to have a better effect on the ripening of the cervix than the intravaginal one if we only consider the proposition of softening success (group a 14/52; group b 6/48). the following mean times were shorter for the pessary group than for the gel group: (1) insertion of the ripening agent to vaginal delivery (20.6 vs 26.4 hours, p = 0.017), (2) time to achieve cervical ripening (11.1 vs 15.2 hours, p < 0.001), (3) time to achieve active labor (18.3 vs 25.5 hours, p = 0.019), and (4) hospital stay (3.7 vs 4.4 days, p = 0.03). twelve patients in the pge2 group and two in the placebo group were delivered within 24 h (p less than 0.001). there was no significant difference in parity, gestational length, maternal characteristics, indications for induction or preinduction cervical scores between the treatment groups. compared with intracervical therapy prostaglandin e2 given intravaginally was more likely to significantly change the bishop score (60.4% vs 40.4%, p = 0.04) and stimulate regular contractions (72.9% vs 48.1%, p = 0.01). misoprostol is more cost-effective than the comparable commercial dinoprostone prostaglandin preparations as an adjuvant to labor induction in women with an unfavorable cervix. the 53 women who received the placebo gel had an outcome similar to that of the 47 women who received the prostaglandin e2 gel. coarser side effects did not occur in our group, and there is also no higher incidence of surgical deliveries. endocervical prostaglandin e2 had a more marked effect on cervical ripeness than did vaginal prostaglandin e2, but this did not result in any differences in more substantive outcomes. p less than 0.0001) resulting in a lower cesarean delivery rate, 26 vs. 47 per cent (p greater than 0.05). significantly better results for both cervical priming and labor induction were obtained after intracervical pge2-gel application than after treatment with placebo or vaginal suppositories. the cesarean rate was also significantly lower in the pge2 group (13.1 versus 31.6%, p = .016). both groups were similar with respect to change in bishop score, start-to-delivery interval, amount of oxytocin required, mode of delivery and success of induction. no statistically significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups with respect to the incidence of spontaneous versus induced labor, need for oxytocin augmentation, gel-to-induction interval, bishop score change, maximum oxytocin dose, maximum dilatation rate, length of labor, cesarean section rate, fetal apgar scores, fetal umbilical vein ph, or fetal umbilical artery in patients with unfavorable bishop scores the intravaginal application route resulted in a better cervical ripening, a shorter induction to delivery interval and a higher cumulative rate of deliveries during 24 h (p=0.01). there were no significant differences between the groups except in the incidence of patients going into labor within 72 hours. there was no significant difference between the two groups in the use of instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections nor was there any difference with regard to fetal distress. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 470 patients with unfavorable bishop scores (3-4 women with various degrees of cervical ripeness patients with

or significantly improved symptom scores for fatigue, pain, gi problems, and sleep disturbance, but no such improvements were observed in patients without stomas. overall, quality of life was good but cpa patients had better quality of life scores than apr and lra patients. in general, men had lower social well-being scores, and younger patients had lower physical and emotional well-being scores and colorectal concerns scores. a significantly ( p< 0.001) greater number of patients in the abdominoperineal resection group stopped praying daily (either alone or in a mosque) and fasting during ramadan. improvements in quality of life from the first to the third year after diagnosis in patients who remained free of disease were very modest and limited to less financial difficulties, a better future perspective and fewer stoma-related problems. patients without a terminal abdominal stoma had a better score in six categories of the qol 30 and in two categories of the cr38. the presence of a stoma did not affect the qol of the male patients, while it did affect that of the female patients. based on the sf-36v2, statistically significant and meaningful differences between female cases and controls were observed for seven of the eight scales and on the physical and mental component summary scores. overall, patients with rectal cancer recover well in the long run, with hrqol levels comparable to that of the general population. no significant results were obtained for the remaining scores, but patients undergoing ape consistently had more favorable qol scores than those undergoing ar. high-anterior resection patients had significantly better scores than both low-anterior resection and abdominoperineal extirpation patients. physical function and overall quality of life were better in patients aged 69 and younger, while patients aged 70 and older suffered from fatigue. for patients with different treatment modalities, faecal incontinence and diarrhea were significantly higher in radiation group (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively), and no difference in male or female sexual function was found between radiation group and non-radiation group. both genders had impaired sexual life; however, males had significantly higher values and felt more distressed by this impairment. the rand-36 questionnaire and questionnaires assessing urinary, sexual, and bowel dysfunction were administered to 94 patients with no sign of recurrence a minimum of one year after curative surgery. the only significant difference between the two groups was found in the total score of the symptom-specific scale in favour of anterior resection (p = 0.02). mean qol scores for body image and male sexual problems were better following ar than apr (p<0.01), also in

convergent and divergent validity and good reliability of the fact-c. patients' overall qol was lower at one month after colectomy and recovered to the pre-surgery level at six months after colectomy. quality of life scores for the various factors studied showed that quality of life was worse in women, in patients with tumors in the middle third of the rectum, and in patients undergoing low anterior resection. the failure rate was higher for older patients (p = 0.005) and for coloanal pull-through anastomosis (p = 0.001). stoma construction (n = 51) was associated with a higher global health status (83 vs. 75, p = 0.019), and these patients reported fewer gastrointestinal problems (p = 0.001). although patients having had apr tended to report a lower body image score (p = 0.12) and more sexual dysfunction in male patients, all apr patients tended to report better physical function, future perspective and global qol. no difference was detected in any sf-36 health survey hrqol domain among the groups, although there were differences within groups before and after surgery. patients with lar had a better body image (p.001), dietary habits (p.003) and tolerance to stress (p.004). stoma patients experienced greater financial worries (p = 0.0029), whereas nonstoma patients had greater gastrointestinal concerns (p = 0.0098). ostomates and ostomates did not differ regarding the cumulative score of stool-related questions: 83.75 +/- there was no significant difference in both the short-term and the long-term complication rates between the two groups of patients. preoperative radiation was associated with postoperative ejaculation problems (p = 0.028) and anal incontinence (p = 0.012). the sf-36 and eortc qlq-cr38 (sexuality subscale) scores of the survivors were compared to an age- and sex-matched dutch normal population. the quality of life was significantly better after resection than after excision, most clearly so according to the grogono index, and this was also reflected in the patients' personal assessment. there was no significant difference in global health-related quality of life between patients with and patients without a stoma at any time point. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> male patients with a stoma rectal cancer patients fifty patients treated with ar and 23 patients treated with 373 patients 12 to 18 months after

<punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> although limited by small sample size, pilot results suggest culturally tailored, telephone-based cbt has the potential to enhance access to psychotherapy in an underserved latino population with little access to mental health services. the cc group demonstrated no difference (-0.07%; 95% confidence interval [ci], -4.2% to 4.3%) in the adjusted rates of change in ptsd from baseline to 12 months, whereas the uc group had a 6% increase (95% ci, 3.1%-9.3%) during the year. comprising of both organisational and patient level components, collaborative care is a potentially powerful intervention for improving depression treatment in uk primary care. random regression analyses showed that cc patients improved significantly more over time compared with uc patients on anxiety, depression, and disability measures, with the greatest effects at 3 and 6 months. the telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, p =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, p =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant. with respect to the measures used and pilot study objectives identified, there were no statistically significant differences between the study groups in treatment adherence to the prescription of antidepressant medication or in the incidence and severity of adverse events to medication. telehealth care improved mental functioning at 6 weeks (47.07 vs 42.64; p =.004) and treatment satisfaction at 6 weeks (4.41 vs 4.17; p =.004) and 6 months (4.20 vs 3.94; p =.001). rates of suicidal ideation declined faster (p =.01) in intervention patients compared with usual care patients; at 4 months, in the intervention group, raw rates of suicidal ideation declined 12.9% points (29.4% to 16.5%) compared with 3.0% points (20.1% to 17.1% in usual care [p =.01]). intervention patients also reported significantly higher rates of mental health care (32.1% vs 17.2%, p<.001) and psychotherapy or counseling (32.0% vs 21.2%, p = .007). we found no evidence that the drp program was more effective than cau and no indications for added beneficial effects of either the psychiatric evaluation or the cbt treatment to the basic format of the drp program. intervention patients experienced significantly better physical functioning at 1 year than usual-care patients as measured using between-group differences on the pcs of 1.71 (95% confidence interval (ci)=0.96-2.46) and iadls of -0.15 despite few resources and marked deprivation, women with major depression responded well to a structured, stepped-care treatment programme, which is being introduced across chile. there were no differences in probability of having any medical visit at any point (each p > or = .21). intervention participants were more likely to report treatment response (33.3% vs 17.5%) (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.37-4.56) and remission (22.0% vs 11.9%) (2.25; 1.11-4.54) at 6 months but not 12 months. there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in depression symptoms, quality of life, medication adherence, provider visits, or patient satisfaction. serious adverse events did not differ between the 2 groups. a total of 577 patients were recruited; 516 [89% (95% ci = 86-92%)] were rated as depressed on the bdi and 474 [82% (95% ci = 79-85%)] met criteria for dsm-iii major depression. in a repeated measures linear model with adjustment for baseline scores, the phone therapy group showed significantly lower mean hopkins symptom checklist (hscl) depression scale scores (l. derogatis, k. rickels, e. uhlenhuth, & l. covi, 1974) from 6 months to 18 months versus usual care, f(1, 336) = patients in the intervention group were less likely to suffer from major depressive disorder at follow up compared with usual care (0.32, 95% confidence = interval = 0.11 to 0.93, p = 0.036). this program of telephone-delivered cbt combined with a pedometer-based walking program did not improve a1c values, but significantly decreased patients' blood pressure, increased physical activity, and decreased depressive symptoms. at 6 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant differences the 2 groups in hamd or sf-36 scores or any of the secondary outcome measures. collaborative care significantly improved clinical symptoms and functional status of depressed patients with coexisting chronic general medical conditions receiving treatment for depression in primary care practices in puerto rico. the intervention patients reported greater improvements in mental hrql (all p < or = .02) (sf-36 mcs: delta, 3.2 points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.5-6.0), physical functioning (dasi: there was no difference in the rate of new prescriptions for, or adequate dosing of, anti-depressant medications. centralized telecare management coupled with automated symptom monitoring resulted in improved pain and depression outcomes in cancer patients receiving care in geographically dispersed urban and rural oncology practices. patients in the intervention group also were more likely to have one or more adjustments of insulin (p=0.006), antihypertensive medications (p<0.001), and antidepressant medications (p<0.001), and they had better quality of life (p<0.001) and greater satisfaction with care for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both (p<0.001) and with care for depression (p<0.001). collaborative care produced greater improvement than cl in depressive symptomatology from baseline to 3 months (scl-20 change scores), but at 9 months there was no significant difference. participation in care management was high in the three intervention groups. however, psychiatrist-enhanced pep and cbt-enhanced pep patients reported lower bdi severity during follow-up than uc patients [mean difference 2.07 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.13-3.00) and 1.62 (95% ci 0.70-2.55) respectively] and pep patients [2.37 (95% ci 1.35-3.39) and 1.93 (95% ci 0.92-2.94) respectively]. for the intervention compared to the cluster control the phq-9 effect size was 0.63 (95% ci 0.18-1.07). there were three deaths and four suicide attempts in the collaborative stepped-care group and six deaths and six suicide attempts in the enhanced usual care group. at 3 months, improvement was higher in the tm group in the subscales of physical function, pain, general health, energy, emotional role, mental health and standardized physical and psychic scales of sf-36. integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91). or=50% improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the personal health questionnaire (or=4.51, 95% ci=1.07-18.93). in patients with major depression, the intervention group had greater adherence than the usual care controls to adequate dosage of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more (75.5% vs 50.0%; p < .01), were more likely to rate the quality of the care they received for depression as good to excellent (93.0% vs 75.0%; p < .03), and were more likely to rate antidepressant medications as helping somewhat to helping a great deal (88.1% vs 63.3%; p < .01). the pearls program, a community-integrated, home-based treatment for depression, effectively reduces depressive symptoms in adults with epilepsy and comorbid depression. one-month post-trauma intervention subjects when compared to controls demonstrated statistically significant decreases in ptsd symptoms as well as a reduction in depressive symptoms. no effects were detected for major depressive disorder episodes; a nonsignificant trend favoring cbt was detected on the center for epidemiology depression scale (p = .07). patients in the intervention group received enhanced education and increased frequency of visits by a psychiatrist working with the primary care physician to improve pharmacologic treatment. those randomized to cm exhibited less mh problems at the conclusion of the trial, indicating that the close monitoring program is effective, feasible and valuable. telephone-based collaborative care for panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder is more effective than usual care at improving anxiety symptoms, health-related quality of life, and work-related outcomes. the decrease in the number of women taking antidepressants after 3 months was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (multicomponent intervention from 60/101 [59%; 95% ci 49-69%] to 38/106 [36%; 27-46%]; usual care from 18/108 [17%; 10-25%] to 11/102 [11%; 6-19%]). the cts and lts were equally successful when these conditions could be met, but cts were more successful than lts in less supportive environments. effects were not mediated by antidepressant medication or specialty care counseling in urban or rural patients. overall response rates favored those assigned to tdm compared with those assigned to usual care (39.1% responded vs. 17.6%, p= 0.022). patients offered the program had higher rates of antidepressant adherence (81% continued treatment more than 3 months vs. 61%, p = 0.001), lower symptom checklist depression scores after 5 months (0.95 vs. 1.17, p = 0.043), and greater satisfaction with depression treatment (53% "very satisfied" vs. 33%, p = 0.004). enrolled intervention site patients were more likely to receive appropriate antidepressant care (66% versus 43%, p = 0.01), but showed no significant difference in symptom improvement compared to usual care. a significantly greater improvement for calm vs uc in global anxiety symptoms was found (bsi-12 group mean differences of -2.49 intervention patients also experienced greater rates of depression treatment (or, 2.98; 95% ci, 2.34-3.79; p<.001), more satisfaction with depression care (or, 3.38; 95% ci, 2.66-4.30; p<.001), lower depression severity (range, 0-4; between-group difference, -0.4; 95% ci, -0.46 to -0.33; p<.001), less functional impairment (range, 0-10; between-group difference, -0.91; 95% ci, -1.19 to -0.64; p<.001), and greater quality of life (range, 0-10; between-group difference, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.32-0.79; p<.001) than participants assigned to the usual care group. when compared with usual care patients, intervention patients showed greater improvement in adequacy of dosage of antidepressant medication treatment in the first 6-month period (odds ratio [or], 4.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.28-7.55) and the second 6-month period (or, 2.90; 95% ci, 1.69-4.98), less depression severity over time (z = 2.84, p = .004), a higher rating of patient-rated global improvement at 6 months (intervention 69.4% vs usual care 39.3%; or, 3.50; 95% ci, 2.16-5.68) and 12 months (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 42.3%; or, 3.50; 95% ci, 2.14-5.72), and higher satisfaction with care at 6 months (or, 2.01; 95% ci, 1.18-3.43) and 12 months (or, 2.88; 95% ci, 1.67-4.97). there was significant clinical improvement for depression in both groups, with a trend toward significance in the more intensive module. the percentage of patients with an sdcs "very satisfied" score (≥8) at day 112 was not significantly different in the venlafaxine er and venlafaxine er+d groups (63% and 58%, respectively; p = 0.22). improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001). participants in the integrated care intervention had fewer depressive symptoms (ces-d mean scores, intervention 9.9 vs usual care 19.3; p <.01), lower systolic blood pressure (intervention 127.3 mm hg the combined cognitive-behavioral and pharmacotherapeutic intervention resulted in sustained and gradually increasing improvement relative to treatment as usual, with significantly higher rates at all points of both the proportion of subjects remitted (3 months, 20% vs 12%; 12 months, 29% vs 16%) and responding (3 months, 46% vs 27%; 12 months, 63% vs 38%) and significantly greater improvements in world health organization disability scale (all points) and short form 12 mental health functioning (3 and 6 months) scores. patients in the care management and usual care groups did not differ in terms of their outcomes. gcms most often addressed comorbid conditions (36%), then social issues (27%) and appointment reminders (14%). the intervention also improved anxiety and fatigue but not pain or physical functioning. intervention patients had significantly fewer depressive symptoms, but not fewer episodes of relapse/recurrence over the 12-month follow-up period. 90% of intervention patients rated their depression care as good or excellent at six months compared with 75% of usual care patients (p = 0.0003). there was little difference in outcome between the two treatment arms but a gradual improvement in symptoms over time was seen. improvement was also found for 5-point decrease in phq-9 score among 72.2% of intervention patients compared with 59.7% of euc patients (or = 1.99; 95% ci, 1.14 to 3.50; p = .02). in the quantitative assessment, the intervention did not lead to statistically significant improvements in depression (odds ratio 4.33, confidence interval overlapping 1). intervention patients with minor depression were found to have a significant decrease over time in depression severity on only 1 of 4 study outcome analyses compared with usual care patients. participants in the integrated care intervention had lower levels of glycosylated hemoglobin (intervention 6.7% vs usual care 7.9%) and fewer depressive symptoms (ces-d mean scores: intervention 9.6 vs usual care 16.6) compared with participants in the usual care group at 12 weeks. the interaction between intervention condition and time was also significant (p <.05), indicating that tdm patients improved significantly more over time than did uc patients. self-diagnosed depressed women (vs nondepressed women) had more depressive symptoms and acute care visits, worse general and mental health, and greater impact of health problems on regular activities. implementing a routine screening protocol using the phq-9 and depression care management quality improvements is feasible in diverse home health care organizations and results in consistently better (but not statistically significant) depression outcomes in the int group. ongoing intervention significantly improved both symptoms and functioning at 24 months, increasing remission by 33 percentage points (95% confidence interval 7% to 46%), improving emotional functioning by 24 points (11 to 38) and physical functioning by 17 points (6 to 28). intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (or = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (or = 2.4, p = .02). when compared with the group receiving tau, there was a trend for the intervention group to experience less depression in time. the pharmacist intervention proved equally effective in subgroups traditionally considered difficult to treat: those with chronic depression and dysthymia. compared with control patients, intervention recipients had lower mean phq-9 values in depression symptoms (-1.41 collaborative care subjects were far more likely to receive adequate depression treatment by discharge (71.9% collaborative care vs. 9.5% usual care; p < 0.001). int patients had significantly greater depression improvement (> or =50% reduction in symptom checklist-20 depression score from baseline; 57, 62, and 62% vs. the euc group's 36, 42, and 44% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively; odds ratio 2.46-2.57; p < 0.001). changes in resource utilization were favorable for the intervention group, but differences from the control group did not achieve statistical significance. the pearls program, a community-integrated, home-based treatment for depression, significantly reduced depressive symptoms and improved health status in chronically medically ill older adults with minor depression and dysthymia. blinded interviews by telephone 3 and 6 months after the initial prescription included a 20 item depression scale from the hopkins symptom checklist and the structured clinical interview for the current dsm-iv depression module. compared with patients assigned to usual care, those in the intervention group were 21 times as likely to receive preferred treatment. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START>

low-to-moderate intensity pre-conditioning exercise programme showed beneficial effects on behavioural change, physical fitness, physiological conditions and health-related quality of life. exercise did not alter gfr, hemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, serum lipids, or c-reactive protein (crp). the eg had a significant increase in aerobic capacity, 'squat test' and physical function and physical component scale (sf36). exercise training in rhuepo-treated hemodialysis patients resulted in an improved aerobic exercise capacity, whereas those without exercise training did not have increased capacity. significant effects of exercise were found in peak oxygen uptake measurements (p = 0.03) and in self-reported physical functioning as measured by the short form-36 questionnaire (p = 0.01). multiple regression analysis indicated that the improvement in quality of life depended on the participation in exercise programmes, the effects of training and the reduction in the level of depression. the exercise program had no effect on qol scores and this was most likely due to the short duration of the exercise program and high-functioning level of the population studied as compared to normative data for this patient population. exercise training was associated with an improvement in the mood, level of depression, and psychosocial functioning of these patients; the sedentary controls either became more depressed or reduced their participation in pleasant, socially oriented activities. the serum albumin levels and cgr increased in the training group compared with baseline. sickness impact profile scores were better in pr than pc at 6 months (p < 0.05) and 12 months (ns). the maximal oxygen consumption increased by 43% (p<0.001) and the exercise time by 33% (p<0.001) after training in group a, by 17% (p<0.001) and 14% (p<0.01), respectively, in b, and both remained unchanged in group c. training in group a was also associated with an increase in lvidd (from 52.1+/-6.4 to 54.0+/-6.1 mm, p<0.001) and lvm (226+/-67 to 240+/-84 g, p<0.05) at rest with no change noted in groups b and c. following a 6-month exercise training in group peak oxygen consumption (vo2 peak) increased by 43% (p < 0.05), anaerobic threshold (vo2at) by 37% (p < 0.05) and exercise time by 33% (p < 0.05) after training in group a; by 24% (p < 0.05), 18% (p < 0.05) and 22% (p < 0.05), respectively, in b; and by 17% (p < 0.05), 8% (p < 0.05) and 14% (p < 0.05), respectively, in c; while both remained almost unchanged in group d. there were no differences between intradialytic or home-based exercise training and usual care for either physical function or vascular parameters. in the trained group, changes in oues correlated with those in the maximum oxygen uptake (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) and the anaerobic threshold (r = 0.61, p < 0.01). support group participants reported a significant decrease in pleasant activities while there was no change in the exercisers. no differences were observed between groups, except for a trend toward greater improvement in hdl cholesterol levels in the ex group (p = 0.07). vo2 kinetics remained unchanged in both groups at 90% -vt, but a trend (p = 0.059) towards faster kinetics at the 33 w was observed (et: 49.6 +/- distance walked was highly correlated on the three tests; heart rate change and perceived exertion were only slightly less consistent. transferrin levels were within normal ranges but differed (p <.05) by group (e or ne) and time periods. moderate- to high-intensity strength training improves physical performance, nutritional status and quality of life in people with chronic kidney disease and in dialysis patients. the median maximal work capacity increased significantly in the exercise group and remained unchanged in the control group during a median observation time of 20 months whereas the rate of progression judged by the slope of gfr versus time plot was equal in the two groups. in this high-functioning sample, the exercise program improved physical impairment measures, but had no effect on symptoms or health-related quality of life. there was an overall improvement in pwv, and to a lesser extent bnp levels, with 3 months of intradialytic exercise compared with no exercise, suggesting that regular exercise in eskd may be associated with improvements in arterial compliance and a reduction in cv risk. improvement in muscle strength was significantly greater with resistance training (32% +/- " at baseline hrv index, mean rr, sdnn, and aerobic capacity were significantly reduced in both hemodialysis groups compared with values in group c. also, 40% of all patients on hemodialysis and 16% of group c had arrhythmias (lown class >ii). after training significant improvement occurred in physical capacity (vo2max increased from 16.8+/-6.2 to 23.2+/-7.6 ml/kg/min, p < 0.05). no differences were noted in change-over-time between the two groups in any of the physical performance tests. compared with the uc group, the ex group had significantly greater gains in peak vo2 (p=0.016), percent age-predicted vo2 (p=0.03), and muscle strength (p=0.05), and a trend toward higher self-reported physical functioning (p=0.06). improvement of the variables in the yoga-based exercise program was found to be superior to that in the control group for all the variables except calcium, phosphorus, hdl-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 13 years) receiving long-term haemodialysis (3.7 persons at high risk for developing coronary

infection was significantly reduced with respect to all parameters in the group receiving two doses of cefotaxime, and total drug treatment costs were halved. in a randomized trial, treatment of urethral stricture by direct visual internal urethrotomy with 3 days of postoperative catheterisation was found to be sufficient, given minimal complications, and had a cure rate of 85% after 6 months and 80% after 1 year follow-up. there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to pathology, weight of prostatic resection, mean volume of first void, or time to first void after catheter removal. bladder infusion before a tov after turp significantly increases the rate of readiness for discharge, allowing an early decision to discharge on the second day in a large proportion of patients. asymptomatic bacteriuria at catheter removal was found in 21.0% of suprapubic and in 12.5% of transurethral catheter patients. delayed voiding occurred in 13 (28.9%) and 10 (21.7%) patients, respectively, and 5 (11.1%) and 3 (6.5%), respectively, received a new catheter. the infusion tom took a mean 13 h less than the other two methods, which were statistically indistinguishable. there was no significant difference in bacteriuria after 14 days (50.0 vs. 53.3%). at follow-up after one year, postoperative bacteriuria was closely correlated to increased rates of both clinical cystitis and asymptomatic significant bacteriuria. postoperative normal bladder function resumed more rapidly when transurethral closed drainage was used (p < 0.05). residual volumes exceeding 200 ml and need for recatheterisation occurred in 9% in the standard prolonged catheterisation group versus 40% of patients in the not prolonged catheterisation group (or 0.15, 95% ci 0.045-0.47). catheter removal on day 1 led to a significantly shorter post-operative hospital stay (2.3 days versus 3.3 days) and did not incur a higher incidence of complications. of 25 patients catheterized for both group postoperative urinary retention occurred in 2 (8%) and required a new catheter. resumption of normal voiding is necessary before prostatectomy patients can be discharged from hospital. there were no statistically significant differences in either the duration of continuous catheter drainage before the return of spontaneous voiding or the incidence of urinary tract infection in the two groups. this trial determined that early catheter removal may be feasible and desirable in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy. we conclude that systematic removal of the catheter at the aforementioned periods is cost-effective, safe and comfortable for the patient. the postoperative urinary tract infection rates of groups a and b were 16.6% and 23.3%, respectively ( p>0.05). postoperative use of suprapubic bladder drainage significantly reduced febrile morbidity (calculated as fever index; p less than .01) and length of hospitalization (p less than .05). no significant difference was noted in the incidence of uti (5 vs. 10, p = 0.25), with a trend towards less uti in group 1. the results show that those patients who were less time under vesical drainage presented a minor frequency of urinary retention after surgery (24.3% vs 30.7% and 43.7%). patients who had their catheters removed at midnight passed a greater volume of urine with both their first (268 ml compared with 177 ml; p<0.0001) and second voids (322 ml compared with 195 ml; p<0.0001) than their counterparts in the 0600 group. the early removal of in-dwelling catheters after operation was not associated with an increased rate of febrile events, urinary tract infections, or need for recatheterization. removing the catheter at midnight allows patients to return to a normal voiding pattern more rapidly and to leave hospital earlier. a randomized prospective study was set up to assess the role of postoperative catheter drainage and the value of hydraulic self-dilatation of the urethra after internal urethrotomy. urinary retention after 7 days was present in 23.99% with suprapubic vesical drainage and 28.5% with urethral catheter. in addition, 29% of the catheterized group had urinary tract bacteriuria compared with 13% of the uncatheterized group (p < 0.025). no significant difference in recurrence rate was found between the two groups studied by means of voiding interview, uroflowmetry and retrograde urethrography. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> ninety-two patients with preoperative sterile urine undergoing 59 patients patients with preoperatively

diarrhoea of any aetiology. patients receiving lgg had a significantly shorter duration of watery diarrhoea [mean (sd) 2.7 (2.2) days] than those receiving the placebo [3.7 (2.8) days, p = 0.03]. lgg supplementation does not decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting in children with awd, and does not reduce hospital stay in these patients. the frequency and duration of diarrhea, requirement for intravenous therapy, and hospital stay were significantly lower in both the intervention groups compared with the controls. mean duration of diarrhea was decreased (p = 0.034) with l. acidophilus lb (43.4 hours) versus placebo (57.0 hours). even on day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ors use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. there was no difference in groups in the duration of diarrhea or numbers of stool on days 3, 6, or 10 of treatment. there was no difference between the study group and control group in the frequency of diarrhea stools on the day before admission (p > 0.05). a statistically significant difference was observed in the number of stools on the 4th and 7th day favouring the subgroup that received early treatment (within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea). however the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05, study group vs control group). patients with acute enteritis showed a significantly faster resolution of bowel abnormalities during treatment with enterococcus sf68 compared with placebo. the number of patients showing a response was clearly higher (p < 0.0001) in the ecn group (52/55; 94.5%) than in the placebo group (39/58; 67.2%). on the second day of treatment only 26% of patients receiving l. reuteri had watery diarrhea, compared with 81% of those receiving placebo (p = 0.0005). no intergroup differences were found in beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, and glycocholic acid hydrolase levels. duration of diarrhea and number of stools were significantly less in group y compared with group m. forty-eight hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 62% of group m versus in 35% of group y (p < 0.002). significant differences were observed on days 14 (ecn 93.3%, placebo 65.8%, p = 0.0017) and 21 (ecn 98.7%, placebo 71.1%, p < 0.001). the median duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter (p = 0.017) in patients who received nitazoxanide (81 h) and probiotics (72 h) compared to patients who received oral rehydration solution alone (108 h). in the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance. hospital stays were significantly shorter in group b than in group a. administering oral rehydration solution containing lactobacillus gg to children with acute diarrhea is safe and results in shorter duration of diarrhea, less chance of a protracted course, and faster discharge from the hospital. the time to recovery after early treatment was 79 h vs. 139 h in the placebo group (p = 0.02); 1 of 17 patients treated early vs. 6 of 13 in the control group still had loose stools 120 h after start of treatment (p = 0.03). stool frequency was less on the second day in the lactobacillus group (p < 0.05). the duration of the diarrhoea was not influenced by the intake of probiotics. baseline characteristics such as mean age and the average frequency of stools were comparable in s. boulardii and control group at the time of inclusion in the trial. when compared to the placebo, bifilac showed clinical as well as statistically significant reduction in number of episodes (frequency) of diarrhea in a day, mean duration of diarrhea (in days) degree of dehydration, duration and volume of oral rehydration salt [ors] therapy, duration and volume of intravenous fluid [ivf] therapy, duration of rotaviral shedding (p<0.01). the duration of diarrhea was 82 h in the treatment group vs. 101 h in the control group (not significant, p = 0.07). s. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically. there was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in diarrhoea frequency on day 2 between probiotics (3.3 [loose stools]; 2.5-4.3) and placebo (4.7; 3.8-5.7) groups. the percentage of cd8 lymphocytes on day 7 was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2. stools had a normal consistency on day 3 in 38 (76%) of 50 patients in the s. boulardii group compared with only 12 (24%) of 50 in the control group (p = 0.019). no effect of st11 treatment on severe rotavirus diarrhea was observed. stool-reducing substances (> 1%) were detected more frequently in the mf group, and the differences were significant for day 3 of the study (p = 0.04). no significant difference was observed by 48 hours in those presenting with bloody diarrhea. patients receiving sf 68 had a reduced duration of diarrhea compared with placebo, with a highly statistically significant difference between treatments. median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). l. reuteri effectively colonized the gastrointestinal tract after administration and significantly shortened the duration of watery diarrhea associated with rotavirus. significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days (p=0.035), reduction in diarrhea frequency (p=0.049) and weight gain (p=0.017). there was no significant reduction in diarrhea duration and stool output in the group. interferon- gamma and il-12 were mildly elevated in the probiotics group, compared with the placebo group. six days after the onset of diarrhea, stools in only 4 out of 31 children that received lactobacillus gg were positive for

(ham-a), and the state-trait anger expression inventory and were assessed weekly. analyses that used random-effects regression modeling and controlled for baseline severity showed e-epa to be superior to placebo in diminishing aggression as well as the severity of depressive symptoms. significant drug-placebo differences were found, regardless of diagnosis, on "illusions," "ideas of reference," "psychoticism," "obsessive-compulsive symptoms," and "phobic anxiety," but not on "depression." primary outcome measures were changes on the interpersonal sensitivity, anger/hostility, and depression scales of the symptom checklist 90 (scl-90) as well as the total score of the modified overt aggression scale (moas). topiramate appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of anger in women with borderline personality disorder as defined by scid criteria. analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences between ziprasidone and placebo in the cgi-bpd. weight gain was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in those treated with placebo (p < .02). however, olanzapine monotherapy and ofc seem to be superior to fluoxetine monotherapy in treating both of these dimensions of borderline psychopathology. three-way comparisons between groups indicated superior efficacy for phenelzine, followed by placebo and haloperidol on measures of depression, borderline psychopathologic symptoms, and anxiety. no significant positive effects of the drug were found. there was significant improvement from baseline in both global

significant improvement over placebo in depression, anxiety, and impulsivity/aggressive behavior. a secondary finding was that patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in

significantly greater improvements in scores for depression, suicidality and daily stresses. significant changes on four staxi scales (state anger, p < .01; trait anger, p < .05; anger out, p < .01; anger control, p < .01) were observed in the subjects treated with topiramate. haloperidol (4-16 mg/day) produced significant improvement over placebo in global functioning, depression, hostility, schizotypal symptoms, and impulsive behavior. the only exception (p < 0.05) was found on the anger-in scale, where a difference of only 8.5% (p < 0.2) was found. time-by-group interaction effects revealed no significant group differences in scores from pre-treatment to posttreatment on any measure. fluvoxamine but not placebo produced a robust and long-lasting reduction in the scores on the

useful in the detection of cin 2/3 in lsil groups and in the selection of patients for colposcopy in ascus groups, but it is not suitable for cervical cancer screening tests. in detecting cin2+ and cin3+, la is 5% and 6% more sensitive but 9.5% and 8.7% less specific than hcii (area under roc curve; p = 0.317 and p = 0.875, respectively). sensitivity to detect cin3 or above by testing for cancer-associated hpv dna was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [ci] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. the sensitivity of the second pap smear and hpv-dna test to detect cin 2-3 was 61 (95% ci = 45-74) and 82% (95% ci = 67-91), respectively. hc ii was also more often positive in women with negative colposcopic evaluations (29% [25.7-32.4%] vs. 20% [17.6-23.5%], p < .005). cintec p16ink4a cytology had a sensitivity of 83.0%, specificity of 68.7%, and ppv of 52.3%. for women with histologic hsil+, the hpv test was positive in 89.2% (95% confidence interval [ci], 78.4%-95.2%), and the specificity was 64.1 % (95% ci, 60.9%-67.2%). proex c staining is a more sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting cervical disease than adjunct testing for hr-hpv status in papanicolaou tests with asc-us. the area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve was significantly less among women aged 25-34 years than in those older, both considering ascus/agus (atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) (p=0.0355) and lsil (p=0.0009). high-risk hpv types were detected in 31.3% of all subjects, 36.4% of those with cin 1, and 93.3% of those with cin 2-3. they showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between negative p16 expressions of pap smears with the presence of reactive lesions in follow-up biopsies and hr-hpv viral load. hpv test showed the best performance; overall, it had the highest sensitivity (92.3%), specificity (78.6%) and ppv (14.9%). specificity was 44.9% in women less than 30 of age and 64.4% in women more than 30 of age. hpv dna testing improves the accuracy of colposcopy in the detection of high-grade cin in women with ascus or lsil smears. in each group, the detection rate of grade 2,3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin 2,3) or cervical cancer in patients with positive hpv dna was significantly higher than that with negative hpv dna (p<0.05). genotyping of discordant results showed a prevalence of lr-hpv types in hc2 positive/amplicor negative samples, and a similar prevalence of hr- and lr-hpv types in amplicor positive/hc2 negative samples. human papillomavirus-negative women with asc-h cytology were at a reduced but significant risk of cin2 or more severe (cin2+) (10.6%) compared with hpv-positive women with asc-h cytology. the proex c immunocytochemical assay can be integrated into a clinical cytology laboratory and may increase the ppv of lbc for biopsy-proven hsil. high-risk group hpv detection can be used as an additional triage test to detect hsils in women having asc-us with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. hpv testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin2+). hpv infection was diagnosed in 11.2% of afr and 38.0% of asc-us (p=0.00003); high-risk hpv types (namely, hpv-16, -18, -31, -66, -67 and -70) were found in 6.7% of afr and 22.8% of asc-us (p=0.00239). compared with hpv dna testing, which detected 87.5% (7/8) of the cases of cin 2 or 3, repeat pap smear showing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (hsil) detected 11.1% (1/9) of cases (p = 0.004), and repeat pap smear showing ascus, lsil or hsil detected 55.6% (5/9) (p = 0.16). for women with ascus, hpv testing was highly sensitive for detecting cin3 and cancer with dramatically fewer referrals of older women. differences in specificities were also observed: 82.4% (81.8%-83.1%) for thin-layer pap (with a result of > or = ascus), 78.8% (77.9%-79.7%) for pcr, and 72.6% (69.4%-75.0%) for signal amplification. the sensitivity of this test for high grade-sil or higher was 90.2% and the negative predictive value was 96.5% (odds ratio=18.9; 95% confidence interval, 10.9-33.1). the sensitivity and specificity of the repeat pap smear alone for the detection of cin 2/3 were 73.7% and 62.9%, respectively, when referring all women with a repeat pap smear using an ascus-positive threshold. the surepath, inform hpv, and hc2 correctly identified high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsils) in 15 (94%) of 16, 6 (38%) of 16, and 14 (93%) of 15 cases, respectively. for lsil, the sensitivity was 75% (3 of 4 specimens) for p16(ink4a) and 100% (4 of 4 specimens) for hc2. the rates of detection of hpv dna and of e6 and e7 transcripts were 33.3% and 25%, respectively, for specimens with normal findings; 51.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (cin1); and 61.1% and 44.2% for specimens with cin2, respectively. the hpv dna triage showed a good accuracy (specificity over 94%, sensitivity of 37% and ppv for cin2+ lesions around 30%). two abnormal quadrants (90% vs. 38%</= cervical intraepithelial neoplasia sensitivities of hybrid capture ii for detecting cin and high-grade cin (0.81 and 0.86, respectively) were similar to those of cytology (0.83 and 0.82, respectively) and pcr (0.77 and 0.95, respectively), and higher than those of southern blot hybridization (0.48 and 0.45, respectively). adding a high-risk hpv test in secondary screening increased the identification of women with cin2-3

response to hiv, no increase in cd4(+) the adverse events were not significantly different among arms (p=.27). after 48 weeks, there was no significant difference between groups in lipid, hepatic transaminase, and c-reactive protein levels in 41 patients. major hiv drug-resistance mutations were not induced through cd4 cell count-guided treatment interruptions in hiv-infected patients successfully treated with haart after dual-nrti therapy. subjects with variable cd4+ t-cell percentages tended to have higher pre-haart plasma hiv-1 rna set-points and experienced higher levels of plasma hiv-1 rna rebound during sti. four out of 7 patients in the haart group failed to control hiv by week 6 and had to restart therapy due to either viremia rebound or cd4 decrease. patients with lower cd4 cell counts at therapy initiation were more likely to resume therapy than were those with counts of >500 cells/mm3 (<200 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 4.4]; and 200-350 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 2.9]). although numbers of ctls did increase over the same time that viral rebounds decreased, there was no correlation between ctl count and either viral rebound rates or clearance rates. those subjects who controlled viral replication developed significantly stronger hiv-1 specific cellular immune responses than subjects lacking spontaneous decline (p < 0.05). t cell counts, and showed no enhancement of antiviral cd8(+) after haart resumption and consequent inhibition of hiv replication, vgamma9vdelta2 t cell reactivity was restored both quantitatively and functionally. hiv-specific cd8+ t cells increased between week 0 (median, 343 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood lymphocytes [sfc/106 pbl]) and week 52 (median, 1930 sfc/106 pbl), but there was an inverse correlation between response and the number of spot-forming cells. cd4 nadir was a significant predictor for treatment reinitiation in a multivariate analysis. cd4 lprs to p24 increased significantly (p = 0.001) between day 0 of the first sti cycle and 4th sti but decreased thereafter. in contrast, group b patients showed no significant changes in immunological parameters during a prolonged drug-free period. although some disturbances appear at the resumption of therapy, no definitive problems are found that preclude such therapeutic approaches from a psychological perspective. in these patients, there was no evidence of mutations suggestive of drug resistance, and plasma saquinavir levels were within the expected range. in 14 of 25 and in 3 of 25 subjects, the m184v and the l90m mutations, respectively, were detected as minor populations, at different times during sti. at enrolment, hiv-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of il-16 and rantes, and significantly lower concentrations of mcp-1, than did healthy controls. consistent with a loss of phenotypic susceptibility to lamivudine, the m184v mutation was detected by genotypic analysis (direct and clonal sequencing) in plasma samples collected from two patients at the end of the second or third sti. also, secondary analysis showed no difference between the two strategies in terms of safety, retention of immune reconstitution, and clinical therapy failure. a rebound in plasma viral load was detected in all patients from day 3 to day 31 with a mean doubling time of 2.01 (se 0.29) days. (iv) the increase in hiv-specific cd8(+) t lymphocyte frequencies induced by sti was not correlated with decreased viral set point after sti; and (v) hiv-specific cd4(+) sti in chronically hiv-1-infected patients is not associated with reductions in cd4 t lymphocytes or to clinical complications in this group of patients after 2 years of effective plasma viral suppression. long term treatment will increase the frequency of: i) drug-related side effects; ii) onset of drug-resistant viral strains; iii) non-adherence of the patients to the treatment. the duration of the first interruption and the reduction of time on therapy were related to nadir cd4+ cell count. no significant differences were observed between haart and hu groups in na, ctl and lpr at any time-point. in

0.001). subjects on interferon beta-1a 30 microg had a lower rate of accumulation of t2 lesion load than controls (p = 0.025); subjects on 60 microg had a greater rate of ventricular enlargement than controls (p = 0.025). progression rates at 12 and 24 months were higher for the placebo group (p = 0.088) with 2-year probabilities of progressing of 20.4% for cop 1 and 29.5% for placebo. no significant differences between the treatment groups were found in any of the other clinical outcome measures or in the change of t2-lesion load over time. the edss score decreased in the ivig-treated patients and increased in the placebo group (-0.23 combination therapy resulted in a 24 percent reduction in the relative risk of sustained disability progression (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.96; p=0.02). significantly less progression of impairment as measured by validated tests of upper-extremity function was observed in the methotrexate treatment group in the absence of clinically significant toxicity. after 1 year, the proportion of relapse-free patients did not differ statistically according to treatment (ivig 0.2 g/kg: 57%; ivig 0.4 expanded disability status scale (edss) decreased by 0.7 u in betaferon-treated patients (p < 0.001), 0.3 u in rebif-treated patients (p < 0.05), and remained stable in avonex patients. when ppms and spms patients were analysed separately, the time to sustained progression was also longer in the ivig group, but the difference was not significant. there was no significant difference in time to confirmed progression of edss scores between placebo-treated patients and either of the ifnbeta-1b treatment groups. post hoc analysis showed that survival curves for ga-treated male patients diverged early from pbo-treated male subjects (hazard ratio, 0.71 [95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.95]; a statistically significant difference in the mean number of exacerbations was observed between the mitoxantrone group and placebo group both during the 1st and the 2nd year. more disabled patients worsened by 0.3 (cop 1 group) and 0.4 (placebo group) unit. mitoxantrone 12 mg/m(2) was generally well tolerated and reduced progression of disability and clinical exacerbations. interferon beta-1a treatment produced a significant delay in time to sustained edss progression (p = 0.02). in the nonrandomized patients (ifnbeta-1b), the annual relapse rate was not significantly different, but the time to progression was shorter. there was a significant reduction in the number of relapses (7 v 31; p < 0.01), and an increase in the number of patients free of exacerbation (14 v 7; p < 0.05). time to neurological deterioration was not different between trial arms (log-rank test, p = 0.3135). the cumulative numbers of gd-enhancing lesions and new t2wi lesions in the ivig groups were reduced in comparison with the placebo group. there were also significant differences in favour of interferon beta-1b in most of the secondary outcome measures, including delay of confirmed disease progression. the relapse rate was also significantly reduced by 33% for ga-treated patients (p = 0.012). the overall number and severity of adverse events were similar between the treatments and were not an important cause for discontinuation of the trial during the 96 weeks. although immunosuppression therapy can be safely administered to ms patients in an outpatient clinic, evidence of substantial benefits was not found. natalizumab reduced the rate of clinical relapse at one year by 68 percent (p<0.001) and led to an 83 percent reduction in the accumulation of new or enlarging hyperintense lesions, as detected by t2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (mri), over two years (mean numbers of lesions, 1.9 with natalizumab and 11.0 with placebo; p<0.001). the mean changes on the expanded disability status scale and in the survival analysis show a trend in favour of azathioprine both in slowing disease progression and reducing relapse frequency. the relapse rate was significantly lower at 1 and 2 years with both doses of interferon beta-1a than with placebo (mean number per patient 1.82 for 22 microg group, 1.73 for 44 microg group vs 2.56 for placebo group: risk reductions 27% [95% ci 14-39] and 33 [21-44]). 0.13 for those receiving placebo, a 29% reduction in favor of copolymer 1 (p = 0.007) (annualized rates = 0.59 for copolymer 1 and 0.84 for placebo). although some side effects were noted in all groups, a dose-related trend in reduction of exacerbation frequency and side-effect profile was noted. the "intent-to-treat" groups had no statistically significant differences in the rates of progression among the 3 treatments. new or enlarging t2-hyperintense brain mri lesions and gadolinium-enhancing lesions were reduced at months 12 and 24 (both p < 0.001). annual relapse rate was 0.27 with placebo and 0.25 with ifn (rate ratio = 0.90; 95% ci 0.64 to 1.27; p = 0.55). flu-like symptoms were more common in patients treated with interferon beta-1b (p<0.0001), whereas injection-site reactions were more common in patients treated with

gastric ulcer ulcer recurrence and h. pylori infection <INPUT_END>  <punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> at five weeks, h. pylori had been eradicated in 41 of the 45 patients in the antibacterial-treatment group (91.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 82.9 to 99.3) and in 5 of the 40 in the omeprazole group (12.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 22.7; p < 0.001). duodenal ulcers were found in four (5%) the co-prescription regimens gave high h pylori eradication rates determined using two tests (clotest and 13c-urea breath test) for the presence of the organism. histopathological results showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between eradicated and non eradicated patients in terms of severity of inflammation and intestinal metaplasia, but not in terms of atrophy. no recurrence was noted in the duodenal ulcer patients and only 4% of gastric ulcers recurred after successful eradication during follow-up for 5 years. triple therapy eradicated h. pylori in 51 patients [intention-to-treat, 84%; 95% confidence interval (ci), 75-93%]. rapid, complete, and persistent suppression of gastroduodenitis activity and gastric surface epithelium lesions was observed in most hp-eradicated group fifty percent of patients who received ranitidine alone for healing of duodenal or gastric ulcer had a relapse within 12 weeks of healing. among the dual therapies, higher eradication rates occurred when lansoprazole (with amoxicillin) or clarithromycin (with lansoprazole) was administered t.i.d. clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients with duodenal ulcer associated with h. pylori infection. triple therapy had a similarly high healing rate to h2-blocker therapy (100% vs 90.5%) at two months of follow-up. omeprazole plus clarithromycin dual therapy eradicated h. pylori in 83% of patients with duodenal ulcer and significantly decreased 12-month recurrence from 76% to 6%. the ulcer healing rate was 100% [95% confidence interval (ci), 95-100%] in h. pylori-negative and 83% (95% ci, 67-94%) in h. pylori-positive patients (p<0.01). in the omeprazole/amoxycillin group 93% (67/72; 95% confidence interval 84% to 98%) of gastric ulcers healed and 83% (29/35; 66% to 94%) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.103). the differences in the eradication and relapse rates between o vs. omc and o vs. oac were statistically significant (all, p < 0.001). h. pylori recurred in 13 patients and the reinfection rate was 44.8% over two years. the ulcer healing rate was 90.2% (95% confidence interval (95% ci): 79-97%) in the omeprazole group at 6 weeks as compared to 83.3% (95% ci: 70-93%) in the triple therapy group (p = 0.38). treatment with an antibiotic only regimen was effective for the healing of duodenal ulcer, and clearance as well as eradication of h pylori contributed significantly to the healing. the cure rate for h. pylori infection was 4.2% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 38.5% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.01) for gastric ulcers, and 0% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 61.9% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.001) for duodenal ulcers. hp eradication was achieved in 82% of the ome + amx group, but in 0% of the ome group. on an intention-to-treat basis, omeprazole/amoxicillin led to cure of h. pylori infection in 67.1% (47 of 70) of patients not using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)/aspirin (asa) and in 46.7% (14 of 30) of those taking nsaids/asa (p < 0.05). the eradication rates of h. pylori in the full analysis set were 0% in group a-lpz-only, 87.5% in group b-lac200 and 89.2% in group c-lac400 for gastric ulcer and, 4.4% in group a-lpz-only, 91.1% in group b-lac200 and 83.7% in group c-lac400 for duodenal ulcer. cure rates of h. pylori infection were 91% in the omeprazole plus amoxicillin group, 0% in the omeprazole plus placebo group, and 89% and 0%, respectively, performing an intention-to-treat analysis. gastric ulcer relapse was observed in 49% of patients who were h. pylori positive and in 2% who were h. pylori negative after treatment. the relapse rate at the 3rd month was 11.7% (2/17) in the triple therapy group and 60% (6/10) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.0248). eradication rates pp were oac 83% (95% ci: 68-93%), omc 93% (95% ci: 80-98%) and o 3% (95% ci: 0-13%). combined therapy with anti-h. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. among the 52 patients given antibiotics, h. pylori was eradicated in 46, as compared with 1 of the 52 given placebo (89 percent vs. 2 percent, p < 0.001). the three schemes of treatment were effective for ulcerous healing with 70.5%, 82.3%, and 78.2%, respectively, without significant differences. the recurrence rates of duodenal ulcers confirmed by endoscopy in these three groups were 64%, 33% and 0% at the third month, and 73%, 67% and 5% at the sixth month, respectively. the difference (higher relapse rate for omeprazole-treated patients) was significant (p < 0.001) by the second evaluation, 4 months after treatment. cumulative relapse rates at 12 months were 12% (two of 17) in patients in whom h pylori had been eradicated and 100% (10 of 10) in those with persistent infection after short term therapy (p < 0.05). the healing quality of ulcer in group b was superior to that in groups c and a (p<0.05). eleven patients in the triple therapy group suffered from adverse effects (45.8%) (p < 0.05 as compared with other groups). on bismuth, only one patient became helicobacter pylori-negative (8.33%, p < 0.0001), but ulcers healed in 8/12 patients (67%, p = ns). eradication rates at 4 weeks or 8 weeks were 82% for eac and e20, 77% for eac and placebo and 9.5% for e20 bid and e20 (intention-to-treat analysis). the prevalence of h. pylori was 82% and the eradication rate 88% in the omc group and 3% in the op group. there was no duodenal ulcer recurrence in 43 h. pylori-negative/cured patients (0%), which was significantly different in terms of duodenal ulcer recurrence (p=0.001). eradication of h. pylori was significantly better with lansoprazole with triple therapy than with either lansoprazole with amoxycillin or lansoprazole alone (90% vs. 55% vs. 3%, respectively). h. pylori eradication occurred in 0% of the cimetidine group and in 73.7% of the double-therapy group (p = 0.004). the combination of rbc plus amoxicillin resulted in higher h. pylori cure rates (55%) and higher duodenal ulcer healing (74%) than did either treatment alone. the coprescription regimens gave significantly higher observed h. pylori eradication rates (82% and 74% for rbc400 + clar and rbc800 + clar) compared with rbc400 (0%; p < .001). h. pylori eradication rates as diagnosed by culture, histology, urease test, and [13c]urea breath test 4 weeks after stopping therapy were 0, 0, 8, 45, 6, 46, and 62%, respectively, in groups i-vii. however, the overall failure rate (absence of healing, relapse) was lower (p = 0.04, log-rank test) in the antibiotic group in which all relapses but one were observed in h. pylori positive patients. reinfection rates at 6 months were 42.1% and 15.1% in groups b and c, respectively (p < .05). the cumulative rate of recurrence was significantly higher in group i than in group ii (90 vs 30% at 12 months, p < 0.01). healing was similar in both groups at two four weeks. the minimal inhibitory concentration of lansoprazole for h. pylori in vitro is lower than that for omeprazole, prompting interest in treatment with amoxicillin plus lansoprazole. during a 12-month follow-up gastric ulcer relapsed in 20/32 (63%) of the persistently helicobacter pylori positive patients. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 120 patients with h. pylori and gastric ulcers to 66 patients with duodenal

p <.0016, log-rank test) and 2-fold for ab(2) responders (18.3 months) versus nonresponders (9.3 months). eleven of the 26 patients tested had evidence of an anti-stn th1 antigen-specific t-cell response as determined by interferon-gamma, but not interleukin (il)-4, production. ab3-positive patients showed a significantly longer survival (median, 23.4 months; p < 0.0001) as compared with ab3-negative patients (median, 4.9 months). for the population overall, median ttr was not different between treatments at 13.3 months for oregovomab and 10.3 months for placebo (p =.71). vaccine-induced cd8+ and cd4+ t cell clones were shown to recognize ny-eso-1-expressing tumor targets. c-mov18 did not have a mitogenic effect on patients' pbmc and adding il-2 did not change the degree of proliferation. in 5 of 9 patients, tumor reactive cd4+/cd8+ t-lymphocytes increased significantly, indicating specific anti-tumor immunity. specific hla-dp4-restricted cd4+ t cell responses were elicited after vaccination with ny-eso-1(157-170) peptide (emulsified in ifa) in patients with ny-eso-1-expressing epithelial ovarian cancer. the postimmunization increase in anti-osm immunoglobulin m (igm) titer was independently associated with longer survival of the colorectal cancer patients. grade 3 to 4 toxicity was reported in 24.6% of patients in the placebo group and 20.1% of patients in the oregovomab group, respectively. the generation of ca125-specific b and t cell responses after mab-b43.13 injection correlated with improved survival. the network structure of the immune system implicates the possibility of a selective immunization by the activation of idiotypic cascades. all four high-dose and four of six low-dose patients developed moderate to strong dth reactions at the vaccination sites. in 5 of 10 patients, peptide-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) could be detected in the peripheral blood using both intracellular ifn-gamma staining and (51)cr-release assays. immune responses, including antibodies and t cells to oregovomab and ca125, were demonstrated in over half the patients. cd8 t-cell responses were detected in 1 participant ex vivo and in 8 of 9 participants (89%) after in vitro stimulation. the t cells primed by mab wj02 or ca125 proliferated in the presence of ca125 or mab wj02, respectively. ifn-gamma producing p53-specific t-cell responses were induced in all patients who received all 4 immunizations as measured by ifn-gamma elispot. carcinoembryonic antigen (cea) and muc-1 are overexpressed in a substantial proportion of common solid carcinomas. the vaccine was well tolerated and no gastrointestinal, hematologic, renal, or hepatic toxicity related to the vaccine was observed. there were no grade 3/grade 4 adverse events. ab3 was detectable in all patients (median, 236,794 ng/ml);

greater increases in morning pef, the primary efficacy variable, were observed in patients treated with budesonide/formoterol compared with fluticasone propionate (27.4 l/min vs 7.7 l/min; p < 0.001). there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of patients with abnormal response to corticotropin stimulation at treatment week 24. the improvements in both the morning and evening pef were better in the salmeterol than in the fluticasone propionate group, the mean increase in morning pef being 19 l/min higher (95% ci 11.0 to 26.1) and in evening pef being 16 l/min (95% ci 18.4 to 24.0) higher in the salmeterol group. sfc also provided significantly better control of daytime symptoms and a significantly greater reduction in the requirement for rescue salbutamol compared with budesonide. compared with taa, 600 microg bid, treatment with fp 220, microg bid, significantly increased fev1, morning and evening pef, and percent symptom-free days, and significantly reduced rescue albuterol use, number of nighttime awakenings, and overall asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.035). the increase in mean morning pef-the primary efficacy measure-was significantly higher for budesonide/formoterol compared with budesonide alone (16.5 l/min vs 7.3 l/min, p = 0.002). salmeterol added to low-dose beclomethasone was superior (p < or = 0.05) to doubling the dose of beclomethasone in improving peak expiratory flow (pef) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (fev1), and in reducing symptoms of asthma, sleep loss, nighttime awakenings, and use of albuterol. the hazard ratio for both comparisons was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.6; p=0.03). no significant differences between groups were found in fev1, pd20 methacholine, symptom scores, and exacerbation rates after 1 yr. high-dose budesonide had the broadest range of beneficial effects on other outcomes, including symptom scores, morning peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in one second. there were significant differences in favour of salmeterol/bdp in diurnal variation of pef (all time points) and in use of rescue bronchodilator (salbutamol) and daytime and night-time symptoms (some time points). in group a, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. over weeks 1 to 24, morning peak expiratory flow was increased by 47 l/min from baseline with salmeterol treatment as compared with 24 l/min with fp 220 microg twice daily (p < .001) while the percent of symptom-free days increased from baseline by 26% of days as compared with 10% of days (p < .001). no significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, eg2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ecp levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with bud200+f or bud800. secondary efficacy measures included fev1, morning peak expiratory flow, percent of symptom-free days, and daily albuterol use. significant differences in the urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio between treatment groups at 12 weeks (p=0.001) indicated suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the patients on beclomethasone 1000 microg twice daily. the overall mean morning premedication pef for the entire treatment period was higher in the formotero/bdp group (p=0.002). after treatment with salmeterol there was no deterioration of airway inflammation as assessed by mast cells, lymphocytes, or macrophages in bal or biopsies, but rather a significant fall in eg1-positive eosinophils in the lamina propria (from a median 18.3 to 7.6 cells/mm, p = 0.01), which was not seen after treatment with fluticasone. sm/fp250 also resulted in more symptom-free days and nights (p < 0.002) and days and nights with no relief medication (p < 0.001). combined salmeterol fluticasone therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in pefr and symptom control than doubling the dose of fp. after high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, stepping down with the combination inhaler conferred further improvements in bronchoprotection, bronchodilatation, and clinical control, but not inflammatory markers, compared with that seen with a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid. this was accompanied by a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow in the fp400 + salm group in both the morning and evening compared to the fp1000 group. quality of life improved with both treatments, but without significant statistical differences between the groups. both the salm 50 and salm 100 groups had a significantly increased percentage of symptom-free and rescue-free days and nights compared with the bdp 1,000 group, and there was no difference between the two salmeterol groups. secondary efficacy endpoints also showed fsc 100/50 microg twice daily to be more effective than fp 250 microg twice daily alone. patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 1,272 corticosteroid-treated patients (group b symptomatic asthmatics 500 patients with asthma that was well controlled by

of concurrent chemoradiation therapy, suggesting that is the optimal strategy for patients with locally advanced nsclc. overall survival at 3 years was 10% among those given radiotherapy plus cisplatin and 2% among those who received radiotherapy alone (p = 0.00001). median time to progression significantly favored simultaneous chemoradiotherapy (11.5 months; 95% ci, 8.3 to 14.7 months) versus radiotherapy alone (6.3 months; 95% ci, 5.0 to 7.6 months; p < .001, log-rank test). there was no difference with respect to failure-free survival (10% with carboplatin and 9% with radiotherapy

using the 24/4-day ocp (mean 1.47 compared with 2.01, p=.001). most mean changes from baseline laboratory values were comparable between groups, although the mean increase in cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly lower in the levonorgestrel with ethinyl estradiol group. the incidence of adverse events in all treatment groups was similar, with the exception of metrorrhagia, which occurred in more patients in the desogestrel group than in the gestodene treatment groups (p < 0.05). both study treatments were safe and well tolerated by the volunteers as shown by the nature and frequency of adverse events, the routine laboratory examinations, and the physical and gynecological examinations. there was also an increase in the threshold of fibrinolytic inhibition (ratio pai-1) in both groups, which was less pronounced in the 20 micrograms ee group. the changes in the hemostatic variables for drsp/20ee were less pronounced compared to dsg/30ee and drsp/30ee. in both groups, there was a significant increase in triglycerides, hdl-cholesterol and apoprotein a1; the same increase was observed for sbp and cbg. despite the small sample size, the main finding in the trial is clear-cut; loestrin-20 provides poor cycle control and is thus less acceptable as an oral contraceptive than microgynon-30. irregular bleeding (break-through bleeding or spotting) was significantly

statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to the plasma levels of hdl-cholesterol and its subfractions, ldl-cholesterol and apolipoproteins. the median values for the fasting levels of insulin, c-peptide and free fatty acids slightly increased or remained unchanged while the fasting glucose levels slightly decreased after 13 treatment cycles. the difference between the treatment groups with respect to follicle diameters of 10-30 mm and >30 mm was statistically significant (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively). the discontinuation rate due to adverse events, including intermenstrual bleeding, was low (9.8% for 20 micrograms ee2 + 75 micrograms gsd, and 7.2% for 30 micrograms ee2 + 75 micrograms gsd) and was in the lower range known for other oral contraceptives. withdrawal bleeding characteristics were comparable between the two groups, except for the length of the latent period, which was significantly longer in the lng/ee group. breakthrough bleeding and spotting was reported by a significantly lower percentage of participants in the ortho tri-cyclen lo group compared with the loestrin fe 1/20 group. no clinically significant differences were noted in weight, blood pressure, papanicolaou smears or laboratory data. bloating, breast tenderness, and nausea were approximately 50% more common in women using 35 micrograms ee as compared to 20 micrograms ee preparations. however, discontinuation rates for medical reasons differed significantly between the treatment groups, with the preparation containing 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol

effective and cost-effective than reduction and fixation in healthy older patients with a displaced intracapsular fracture of the hip. no difference could be demonstrated in the mortality rates, fracture- or operation-related complications or the need for secondary intervention. hemiarthroplasty is associated with better functional outcome than internal fixation in treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients. the range of passive hip motion in the three groups of patients did not differ significantly (p>0.05). internal fixation proved to be a less time-consuming operation, gave a shorter hospitalization time and was associated with a significantly reduced morbidity rate compared with prosthetic replacement. for the survivors assessed at one, two and three years from injury there were no differences with regard to the outcome for pain and mobility. after two years the rate of failure was 43% in the internal fixation (if) and 6% in the arthroplasty group (p < 0.001). despite high early complications, tha resulted in least pain and most mobility both in the short and long-term and was encouraging with a revision rate of only 6.25%. there was a trend towards decreased mobility in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.066). there are no randomised trials comparing internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty for a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture in relation to mental state. we decided to study whether internal fixation would prove superior to hemiarthroplasty even in displaced femoral neck fractures in patients over 75 years old. hip function was significantly better in the thr group at all follow-up reviews regarding pain (p < 0.005), movement (p < 0.05 except at 4 months) and walking (p < 0.05). there were no postoperative deaths and no significant differences in hospital stay. after the operation, the fracture patients had a lower harris score than the arthrosis patients, and this was most pronounced among those who had undergone osteosynthesis. the mean patient survival was significantly higher in the group undergoing reduction and internal fixation (79 months) compared with that with a cemented

occurred in 15 patients (9.1%) and deep surgical infection in 4 (2.4%). two wound infections occurred in patients receiving e-m, neither due to anaerobic bacteria, but seven wound infections developed in patients given n-e (p = 0.057), five of them caused by anaerobic bacteria. wound sepsis was demonstrated in 11.5% of cases of group a and 23.0% of group b (p less than 0.01); another type of sepsis was observed in 34% of group a and 11.5% of group b (p less than 0.001). no anaerobic pathogens were detected in any of the cases. efficacy of prophylaxis in patients was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (abdominal, urinary, respiratory and wound infections). the rate of postoperative wound infections was not significantly different in the groups (p = 0,09). there was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative sepsis between the two groups (a total of 72 patients). the proportion of patients with wound infections and other infective complications was significantly less (p < 0.02) in those receiving oral ciprofloxacin. there were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients. nonobese patients and patients whose surgical procedures lasted less than 4 hours treated with either drug had significantly higher success rates (p less than 0.01). most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time, estimated by the kaplan-meier method). there was a low incidence (1.3%) of serious postoperative bleeding and no serious adverse reactions were noted. the wound infection rate was 8% in those patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis and 20% in those receiving tinidazole (p less than 0.05). no differences were found in the two groups between frequencies of anastomotic dehiscences, intra-abdominal abscesses, sepsis, and pulmonary infections. because of an unacceptably high rate of surgical infection in all three groups (36%, 29% and 39%, p greater than 0.1) among the first 103 evaluable patients, the study was discontinued. when the four surgical blocks were separately considered, however, the difference between the two regimens was found to be mainly due to rectal operations, following which the incidence of abdominal and of perineal wound infections was significantly lower with the combined regimen than with doxycycline alone. ignoring the treatment group, the median postoperative hospital stay was 17 days (interquartile range 10 days) for infected patients and 11 days (interquartile range 4 days) for those not infected.(abstract truncated at 250 words) the operative site infection rate was 6.5% for cefmetazole and 7.7% for cefoxitin (p greater than 0.05). patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (p less than 0.01). both regimens were acceptable with minimal toxicity. perineal wound sepsis (31 per cent) was significantly more common than abdominal wound sepsis (7 per cent). in the cefotaxime group 22 of the 241 patients who had an anastomosis developed leaks (9%) compared with 8 of the 239 in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group (3%). five out of 36 evaluable patients had an infection at the operation site. surgical infections occurred in 92 (26.4 per cent) of 349 evaluable patients. the prophylactic regimen significantly reduced the number of urinary tract infections (p less than or equal to 0.0001). ertapenem is more effective than cefotetan in the prevention of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery but may be associated with an increase in c. difficile infection. wound infection rates, which included minor and delayed infections, were similar in both groups (group p, 57 of 342, 16.7 per cent; group t, 55 of 358, 15.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence intervals for the difference being -4.1 to +6.7 per cent. there were no significant differences in the infection rates between subgroups. a significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis, intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%). patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group a) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group b or group c analysis of the results showed that the two antibiotics had equivalent prophylactic effectiveness (congruent to 6%) in colorectal surgery. there was no significant difference in wound infection rates between the two groups (14.7% for cefotetan and 13.9% for cefuroxime plus metronidazole), or the rates of other infective complications. a positive wound culture at the end of the operation was more common after colorectal surgery (30,2%) than after biliary surgery (4,6%) and was associated with a higher subsequent infection rate (p = 0,02). the frequency of all wound infections (grade i + grade ii) was 8% in the treatment group (25 patients) versus 66.7% in the control group (24 patients). there was no difference between the groups in deep sepsis or anastomotic leak rates (sulbactam, four patients; cefoxitin, seven patients). wound infection was related to the amount of perioperative blood loss, duration of the operation, type of operation and drainage in the aminoglycoside group. patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated preoperatively with salicylazosulfapyridine run a greater risk of postoperative infection in spite of the prophylaxis. the number of each type of septic postoperative complication and their total did not differ between the group treated by oral antibiotics prior to operation and the group treated peroperatively with systemic antibiotic therapy. there were two episodes of septicaemia, each in the mezlocillin group. no septic complications occurred in the 26 patients (0%) receiving metronidazole/fosfomycin (p less than 0.01). no significant difference was observed concerning local wound infection, septicemia, anastomotic dehiscence or death. antimicrobial prophylaxis was successful in preventing primary site infections in 92.8% of patients in the cefepime + metronidazole arm and 92.9% of patients in the ceftriaxone + metronidazole arm. no statistically significant between-treatment difference was detected in successful clinical response rates at the end of the study (72% for each group). monitoring of operative and postoperative bleeding revealed no evidence (except in one doubtful case) of excessive bleeding associated with the use of a single dose of latamoxef. no significant intergroup difference was found between the respective overall rates of infectious complications (3.2% and 4.9%). there were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures studied, the overall abdominal infection rates (wound, deep, and septicaemia) being 4.6% and 7.4%, and the remote infection rates (pneumonia, urinary tract, and central venous line) 15.1% and 12.8%, respectively. the reduction in the infection rate in the group treated by cefoxitin was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). post-operative peritonitis was not seen. no difference in wound infection rates was seen in patients following appendicectomy, biliary or gastro-oesophageal surgery. this study demonstrated that a single-dose antibiotic regimen was as effective as a multiple-dose regimen in the prophylaxis of wound infections following abdominal surgery. no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 3.1 in group a (1/32) and 0% in group b. urinary tract infections (1 case) and respiratory tract infections (2 cases) were observed only in group b: the overall infection rate was 17 of 149 evaluable patients (11%), 95% ci 6.8 to 17.7. the overall postoperative infection rate was 19.6% with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. the overall incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications was 7.3% (7 of 96) in the control group (no cefoxitin) and 5% (5 of 101) in the treatment group (cefoxitin). thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection, 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage. no significant differences were found in the incidence of other major or minor infective or non-infective postoperative complications between the groups. episodes of sepsis, urinary tract infection and pneumonia were similar in both groups. although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups. wound infection occurred in five of 81 patients who had topical application of ampicillin compared with six of 89 patients who did not receive prophylaxis; the difference was not significant. addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (p = 0.003). wound infection rates were: group 1, 32/453 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 9.4%); group 2, 33/454 (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 4.9% to 9.6%). two of 27 patients receiving cefoxitin developed wound infections, and one developed an intraabdominal abscess (11%). of the 128 evaluable patients, six of the 63 patients (9.5%) in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and seven of the 65 patients (10.7%) in the gentamicin and metronidazole group developed wound infection. orthograde bowel lavage alone proved to be of no effect in reducing the rate of septic complications when used without antibiotic perioperative short-term-prophylaxis and therefore cannot be recommended to be used solely. the rates of infective complications were higher in the parenteral than in the combined group, the difference in wound infection rates being statistically significant; the figures were 27.6 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively (p = .04). only one serious, but non-fatal intra-abdominal complication (1.4%) was observed in this group. intra-abdominal abscess occurred in 8% of those who received amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with 6% of those given metronidazole plus gentamicin. wound infection occurred in 1 case of group a versus 2 cases of group b (p greater than 0.25). the wound infection rate was 37% (10 patients) in group intra-abdominal infections were more frequent in the clindamycin + gentamicin arm of the study (fisher's exact test, p = 0.035). the resulting difference between the overall septic complication rate in patients receiving erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin (10.9 percent) and the rate in patients receiving metronidazole alone (31.9 percent) was significant. co-amoxiclav was given to 230 patients with a total wound infection rate of 5.6% and cefuroxime plus metronidazole were given to 225 patients with a total wound infection rate of 3%. the overall wound infection was 14.4%, with no difference between erythromycin and metronidazole. there was no significant difference in the incidence of operation-related infection, chest or urinary tract infection. when sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group, in contaminated operations. the wound infection rate was 2.4 percent in the patients receiving timentin and 14 percent in those receiving tinidazole (p = 0.01). no significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected. there was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%). no complications were observed from either the 10% mannitol solution or the intravenous flagyl at either clinical, hematologic, or biochemical assessment. the time of hospitalization was reduced from 20.3 days (cp) to 16.7 days (co) (p less than 0.05 s). there was no difference in the other outcome measures studied which included non-fatal deep sepsis, length of postoperative hospital stay, duration of postoperative fever or the use of antibiotics for postoperative infection. doxycycline thus was significantly more effective in preventing complications in general, but metronidazole gave superior protection against anaerobes. when trivial wound infections were disregarded the wound infection rates were 11% and 16% respectively, which again was not statistically significant. the frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens. no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 9% in group a and 16% in group b. infections not of surgical origin were found only in group b (10.4%). infection rates stratified by types of surgery were similar for both regimens. there was no statistically significant difference between both chemoprophylaxis groups (p = 0.10). the data obtained demonstrated that the reduced infection rate was not the result of a reduction in the bacterial content of the colon alone but due to the prophylactic agents used for elective colon surgery. the difference in infection rates (2/41 = 5% v. 7/33 = 21%) was statistically significant. non-wound infectious morbidity was 5.8% (p greater than 0.05) for cefoperazone, mostly urinary tract infections causes by escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus spp. among 224 evaluable cases, the timentin associated wound infection rate (0.7%), nonwound infectious morbidity (8.8%), adverse reactions (1.9%), and total costs ($14.15) were not statistically different than that of the control drug. impairment of cell-mediated immunity was associated with significantly heightened rate of wound infection, and these patients did not benefit from topical antibiotics. bacteriologic examination of the anastomoses, abdominal walls, and wounds showed significantly more sterile cultures in the combination group, although more aerobic cefuroxime-resistant isolates were seen in this group. no significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%). the abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group a and 9.1 percent in group b (difference not significant). the results show the effectiveness of the association gentamicin-metronidazole (9.4% of infections), compared to the control group with no antibiotics (39.1% of infections), x2 = 14.1; p less than 0.001). the results indicate that prophylactic cefotaxime and metronidazole are effective in reducing the incidence of septic complications following colorectal surgery; nevertheless, a study with a larger number of patients is needed to reach a definitive conclusion. there were no significant differences between randomized groups on either preoperative tinidazole or placebo added to pre-, per, and postoperative doxycycline. the infection rate was 10% in the "one-dose" treatment group and 10% in the "four-dose" treatment group. abdominal pain was recorded in 13%, 10% and 4% of patients (p: 0.077). besides those, 26 infections of the urinary tract were observed, which occurred significantly more often after the one-shot dose (40.9%) than with the short-time prophylaxis (18.6%). results in the two different groups were significantly different regarding abdominal abscess and the total infectious episodes in the surgical site with lower frequency in patients receiving both thymostimulin and the antibiotic (cefotetan). deep wound infection or dehiscence was seen in 12 of 105 having both administrations of antibiotics, and in nine of 98 having only intravenous antibiotics. it is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference on the incidence of postoperative wound sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery between the group given doxycycline for five days and the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole for one day. no significant difference in postoperative infections between the two groups could be demonstrated. the wound infection rate was 10.6 percent in patients receiving timentin and 9.7 percent in those receiving mezlocillin (p greater than .05). patients who received tinidazole and doxycycline had significantly fewer infectious complications, reoperations, additional use of antibiotics, and a shorter hospital stay. the concentrations after administration of 2 g cefotiam were higher, as expected, and without any adverse side effects. the rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. wound infections occurred in 5 patients in the combined group but in 17 in the systemic group (p < 0.01, rr = 0.29, 95% ci 0.11-0.75). it is concluded that short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime is as effective as long-term prophylaxis with penicillin and streptomycin. no differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. there was no significant difference in septic complication or mortality rates following short-term vs. long-term prophylaxis. septic complications remote from the abdominal wound, e.g. intra-abdominal abscesses, occurred in both cefoxitin-treated and placebo-treated patients, but numbers were too small for meaningful analysis. in the postoperative course 53% (group a) and 67% (group b) of the patients developed bacterial infections. patients receiving cefoxitin had a higher wound infection rate than patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (12.5% v 3.2%, respectively, p = .06). intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group b patients. other infections were least frequent in group c (four of 29 patients), but were not significantly different to groups b (six of 30) and a (nine of 31). a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (p = 0.03) and blood loss (p < 0.01), while an mrsa infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (p < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (p = 0.07). most postoperative infections were superficial wound infections (14 of 24 patients), and the mean hospital stay in the two treatment groups was equal. there was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups. a subset analysis of prolonged operations found significantly fewer superficial ssis in the single high dose group than in the multiple standard dose group with rates of 22.2% (6/27) vs. 55% (11/20), respectively (p= 0.021). both groups were comparable in sex, age, clinical diagnosis and type of operation performed. a significant excess of wound sepsis in the aztreonam group was seen (23/71 vs 9/70 chi 2 6.60; p less than 0.01). although no serious infections were observed in either group, the incidence of superficial wound infections was relatively high: 19% in the group with metronidazole and gentamicin prophylaxis and 25% in the other group. the postoperative wound infection rate was significantly lower in group i patients than group ii 5.6% (6/107) and 18.4% (21/ 114), respectively (p < 0.01). in an open, prospective, and randomized investigation on the prophylactic efficacy of peroral neomycin sulfate-erythromycin base vs intravenous ceftriaxone-metronidazole preparation in colorectal surgery, no significantly diverging results between regimens were recorded (1/27 [3.7%]

services during the immediate postpartum hospital stay is feasible and seems to stimulate quit attempts. children's urinary cotinine concentrations did not show significant change over time in either group. no significant differences in total and specific immunoglobulin e were found between the groups. at 12 months the cotinine concentration in the counselled group was 55.6% (48.2% to 63.0%) that of controls. the 6-month nicotine levels were significantly lower in mi households. baseline comparison showed no significant differences between the two groups in the mothers' actions to protect the children from passive smoking exposure. in particular, significant and positive differences were found in parenting with the intervention group feeling less restrictions imposed by the parenting role, greater sense of competence in parenting, greater acceptability of the child, and the child being more likely to provide positive reinforcement to the parent. provision to mothers of both groups of health risks of tobacco smoke resulted in significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the control group, with child intervention group having significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the maternal intervention group (p < 0.05). significant or near significant time main effects were seen for children's hair cotinine, per cent confirmed reducers, and, in particular, parent reports of exposure. we found no significant differences between the groups with respect to change in smoking behaviour. the intervention did not change parents' propensity to create or maintain bans on smoking in their homes or otherwise change smoking habits to reduce their children's exposure to ets. at both follow-ups, abstinence rates were twice as great in the intervention group as in the control group (7.7% vs 3.4% and 13.5% vs 6.9%, respectively). the effect was stronger in mothers and in higher social groups. the intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. the prevalence of persistent lower respiratory symptoms was lower among intervention-group infants of smoking mothers whose head of household had no education beyond high school: intervention group, 14.6%; and controls, 34.0%. at 12 and 18 months, there was little impact for either intervention on the main outcomes: child injury (shv: relative risk 0.99; 95% confidence intervals 0.68 to 1.45, cgs: 0.91; 0.61 to1.36), maternal smoking (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to 1.19, cgs: 0.97; 0.72 to 1.33) or maternal depression (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to1.19, cgs: 0.93; 0.69 to 1.27). more treatment (35%) than control (17%) subjects reported smoking outside their homes at posttest (and their children's cotinine levels were lower), but this difference was not statistically significant. significantly greater change occurred in the counseling group than the control groups and was sustained throughout the 2 years of follow-up. the mean log ratio of the follow-up to initial urine cotinine measurements was 6% lower in the intervention group than in the control group. the absolute risk reduction was 7.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.78% to 12.01%). there were no differences between the groups in the exposure of infants to tobacco smoke. cotinine prevalence decreased from 54% to 40% among coached families, while it increased from 43% to 49% among controls. however, counselling led to no differences in parental smoking between the two groups, or in exposure of the intervention and control children to tobacco smoke. the quit rate at 1 month was 7.5% (95% ci, 0-21) in the intervention group and 2.5% (95% ci, 0-7) in the control group. in 1984, when the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 61% among men and 7% among women, approximately 250 million persons in prc smoked tobacco products (1). there were no significant differences between subjects in the three groups in use of the self-help guides, methods used to attempt quitting, and quitting behavior. there was no impact of group assignment on the quit rate, cigarettes/day, or stage of change. after the intervention, cotinine levels were reduced in the intervention group (165 ng/ml) and increased in the control group (346 ng/ml). after 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, p = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the asthma management. a brief intervention to advise parents of asthmatic children about the risks from passive smoking was ineffective in reducing their children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. confronting mothers with their initial concentrations of cotinine was not found to be an additional factor reducing tobacco consumption. asthma symptom days declined more in the high-intensity group, although the across-group difference did not reach statistical significance (p=.138). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> young mothers 136 usual-care controls, 128 intervention-group parents recruited from south australian pediatric hospital outpatient

successful outcomes of a controlled study of in-home behavioural family management (bfm) for schizophrenic patients, a clinic-based version of this intervention was compared with customary care alone for 41 schizophrenic patients in a veterans administration (va) mental health clinic. a significant improvement was found for the intervention group in patients' social relationships, interests in obtaining a job, maintenance of social interests, and management of social conflicts. family intervention was associated with significantly lower levels of family burden. among patients living with family, personal therapy was more effective than family and supportive therapies in preventing psychotic and affective relapse as well as noncompliance. the carers' programme did not offer any significant advantage on any of the outcome measures: psychological morbidity, negative appraisal, coping or social support. families allocated to the mutual support group experienced decreased levels of family burden and increased family functioning and these changes were significantly greater than those of the controls at both post-intervention time points. relapses in the intervention group, although fewer, were not significantly different from the control group. pretherapy and posttherapy measures of negative as were significantly predictive of relapse within the nine-month treatment period for patients in individual treatment. as part of a controlled study of the effectiveness of a counseling program for family caregivers of patients with schizophrenia, we conducted a comprehensive examination of the process. an education program, which was part of a controlled trial of intervention with families of schizophrenic patients, is described and evaluated. the integrated treatment program resulted in significantly greater improvement in patients' general functioning than routine care alone at the end of treatment and 12 months after the beginning of the study. the prp teams were much more likely than the tau psychiatrists to identify prodromal episodes before patients met objective relapse criteria or needed hospitalization. no differences were found between the groups regarding compliance, insight into psychosis, psychosocial function (general assessment of function) or in relatives' expressed emotion scores postintervention or at 1-year follow-up. the nimh treatment strategies in schizophrenia (tss) collaborative study group investigated the efficacy of antisychotic drug maintenance strategies involving reduced medication exposure in interaction with applied and supportive family management for the long-term treatment of schizophrenia. psychological distress, coping behavior, and family satisfaction did not appear affected by support group participation; nor were support groups associated with lower rehospitalization rates for patients. relapse rates immediately after treatment were significantly lower for the multiple-family group than for the control group (12 and 36 percent), and relapse rates were also lower during the follow-up period (25 and 63 percent). the authors found no differences over time between the randomized arms for relatives' satisfaction (f = 23, p = 0 the relapse rate over nine months in the family therapy stream was 8%, while that in compliant families in the relatives group stream was 17%. rehospitalization rates and psychotic symptoms decreased significantly, and medication compliance was high, to an equal degree in both modalities. relapse rates over nine months after discharge were significantly lower for patients in the two behavioural intervention, compared with education only and routine treatment groups. it was only marginally associated with lower use of crisis services, and it was not associated with the amount of outpatient service time. with regard to all measures (number of drop-outs, symptoms according to the brief psychiatric rating scale, social activity according to the strauss-carpenter outcome scale and an interactive test) no difference existed between the groups with respect to rehospitalization data. a reduction in levels of expressed emotion (ee), significantly

0.05) and in dbp in the morning period (6.00 am to 11.59 am) compared with placebo, tasosartan produced significantly (p <.05) greater reductions in both sidbp (-9.4 +/- the reduction in sitting sbp was significantly greater for losartan than placebo all irbesartan regimens reduced trough office seated diastolic blood pressure and seated systolic blood pressure after 2 and 8 weeks of treatment (all p < 0.01, versus placebo except for seated systolic blood pressure in patients in the 75 mg irbesartan once a day group). valsartan produced a significantly higher number of responders (62%) than losartan (55%, p = .02) at the 8 week treatment endpoint. sitting diastolic blood pressure fell 4.0 mmhg with placebo, 7.2 mmhg with 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide, 7.2 mmhg with 50 mg losartan, 9.3 mmhg with 50 mg losartan + 6.25 mg hydrochlorothiazide, and 13.2 mmhg with 50 mg losartan + 12.5 mg hydrochlorothiazide. based on trough blood pressures at week 12, active drug (both arms) was more effective than placebo in lowering sitting diastolic blood pressure, with a very small additional benefit associated with increasing the dose of losartan to 100 mg in patients who did not reach the target blood pressure after the first 6 weeks on losartan 50 mg. telmisartan 40 mg/hctz 12.5 mg significantly reduced mean supine sbp by 18.8 mm hg, a benefit of 6.6 mm hg compared with telmisartan 40 mg and 11.9 mm hg compared with hctz 12.5 mg (both, p < 0.01). the 300 mg dose of irbesartan was associated with the lowest incidence of adverse events (ae) and discontinuations because of ae. all combination regimens produced a statistically significantly greater reduction in msdpb and mssbp than the corresponding monotherapies. results were similar at weeks 4 and 8 for all treatment groups except that the magnitude of change was greater at week 8. all treatments significantly reduced msudbp and msusbp at 4-week end-point compared to baseline (p < 0.001). the effects of losartan, 50 mg twice daily, were not significantly different from those of losartan, 100 mg once daily, but, as expected, the effects were greater than those of losartan, 50 mg once daily (p < .05). no significant changes were observed in the levels of triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (vldl) triglycerides, vldl cholesterol and apolipoprotein b after valsartan treatment. moreover, significant (p < .05) placebo-adjusted differences in ambulatory sbp/dbp and a significant dose-response relationship (p < .001) were observed with all tasosartan dosages during the 24-h, daytime, and nighttime periods. olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine produced significantly greater reductions in ambulatory and seated dbp and sbp compared with placebo. statistically significant differences in responder rates at end point were seen for doses of valsartan of 80 mg and above compared with placebo, whereas the responder rates for valsartan 20 mg was not significantly different from that for placebo. eprosartan is a new nonphenyl angiotensin ii receptor blocker, which has been approved for the treatment of hypertension. the 95% confidence intervals for the difference from placebo were -8.1 to 4.1 for sitdbp and -11.0 to -4.0 for sitsbp (both, p<0.0001). with irbesartan, mean blood pressure decreased significantly and proportionally to the baseline levels of active renin, and angiotensin i and ii. compared with placebo treatment, trough dbp was significantly reduced by a mean (95% ci) of 8.9 (6.0; 11.8) mm hg with 8 mg and 10.3 (7.4; office dbp

combination and gentamicin were significantly superior to placebo or betamethasone in freeing the lids of staphylococcus. no complications attributable to the eye drops were observed. fbut was significantly increased (p < 0.0001), and the mucous fern pattern was also significantly improved (p = 0.0096) in the therapy group. at the end of 4 months, 24% (6/25) of the patients noted no difference between soap and lid scrub, but 89% (17/19) of the others preferred the lid scrub. in comparison, there was no significant increase in tfllt of the control eye after 5 minutes (p = 0.79), 15 minutes (p = 0.77), and 30 minutes (p = 0.81) of treatment, and after 5 minutes following the 30-minute treatment period (p = 0.20) when compared to baseline tfllt. statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in the clinical signs, bacterial count, cure rate, and improvement rate for subjects taking the active medication, compared with those taking the placebo on days 3 and 7. group c had significant reduction in eyelid edema (p = 0.003), foam collection in the tear meniscus (p = 0.02), corneal staining (p = 0.02), secretion turbidity (p = 0.0001), and meibomian gland obstruction (p = 0.0001). the eye warmer was applied for 5 minutes to 44 eyes of 22 patients who exhibited decreased tear break-up time (but) and dry-eye symptoms. one month of topical nac therapy provided statistically significant improvements in fbut and schirmer scores as compared with the initial study visit. bibrocathol was superior to the control treatment in improving the sum score of the 5 scales (by 7.0 vs 4.7 points, p<0.001), especially in patients with primarily severe symptoms (by 8.3 vs 4.8, p<0.0001). the mean mg secretion score, tear break-up time, corneal staining score, number of mgs yielding liquid secretion and symptom scores all improved significantly from baseline to 1 week. bacteriological cultures demonstrated eradication or reduction of potentially pathogenic bacteria in 93.7% of eyes (ciprofloxacin) versus 88.9% of eyes (tobramycin), seven days after starting treatment. the clinical cure rate appeared to be higher with ciprofloxacin than fusidic acid (62% compared with 28%) but this was related to the higher proportion of patients with acute conjunctivitis in the ciprofloxacin group. azithromycin ophthalmic solution in combination with warm compresses provided a significantly greater clinical benefit than warm compresses alone in treating the signs and symptoms of posterior blepharitis. in the 2-week trial, tear film lipid layer thickness increased in both warm moist air device and warm compress groups, with a greater extent of increase in the warm moist air device group. changes in meibum content were observed in the omega-3 group (p = .21); the level of meibum saturated fatty acids decreased. subjects treated with dm/t experienced a significant increase in iop versus those treated with le/t at day 7, day 15, and overall (mean [sd] of 0.6 [2.3] vs, -0.1 [2.2], p = 0.03, 1.0 [3.0] vs. -0.1 [2.4], p = 0.01, and 2.3 [2.3] vs. 1.6 [1.7], p = 0.02, respectively). there was no significant difference in response to 2 weeks of therapy between the patients treated with this ointment and those treated with either an ointment containing gentamicin alone or a placebo ointment. we had a 79% improvement in symptomatology and a 78% improvement in objective findings. the orgahexa eye warmer improved both tear function and ocular surface status, and decreased symptoms significantly without any complications. cyclosporin provided greater improvements in schirmer's scores (p < 0.001) and tear break-up time (p = 0.018) than tobramycin/dexamethasone after 12 weeks of treatment. treatment efficacy was assessed by improvement of symptoms using visual analogue scales, appearance of the eyelids and reduction in numbers of pityrosporum yeasts on the eyelids. seventy five per cent of patients with blepharitis and associated rosacea were symptomatically improved by fusidic acid gel and 50% by oxytetracycline, but fewer (35%) appeared to benefit from the combination. topical csa did not induce an improvement in the symptoms, but it did decrease the number of meibomian gland inclusions in patients with meibomian gland dysfunction. the high dose group (18 patients, 39.13%) reported side effects more frequently than did the low dose

reduced dyspnea by 47% (p < 0.001), but the distance walked did not improve. walking distance was increased by more than 50% by comparison with an unburdened walk in seven patients with the endurance walking test but in only three patients with the six minute walking test. during submaximal exercise, dyspnea score and ve were significantly reduced with o2 (p < 0.05), whereas qleg, vo2leg, and leg fatigue were similar under both experimental conditions. training significantly increased wmax, peak carbon dioxide production (v'co2) and 6mwd while breathing oxygen in both groups. hyperoxia improved dyspnoea but did not significantly alter resting pulmonary hyperinflation in a group of patients with copd of varying severity. training significantly improved the 6-minute walking distance by 20% and 14% in the air and oxygen group, respectively, when the patients were tested on air. after training, endurance in constant work rate tests increased more in the oxygen-trained group (14.5 minutes) than in the air-trained group (10.5 minutes) (p < 0.05). over the 6-month study period, there were no significant differences between patient groups in hrql (chronic respiratory questionnaire

of education and comparison communities for most variables. there were no differences in self-reported knowledge of the benefits of physical activity, attempts to increase exercise, or prevalence of physical inactivity between pawtucket and the comparison community. the project had a slightly favorable intervention effect on cholesterol and smoking, but failed to have an effect on other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. the intervention demonstrated no evidence for an impact on vegetable consumption, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption and weak evidence for a small impact on (intermediate) outcomes of fruit consumption. although there was an increase in the rate of walking-trail use, a community-wide change in walking rates in rural communities was not documented. the intervention, consisting of paid advertisements, public relations, and community participatory planning, attained high levels of awareness and effected significant sustained population-wide changes among the most sedentary in wheeling. the proportion who increased their body mass was 14.2% lower in the intervention district (p < 0.001), implying a 50% relative reduction compared with the control district, and was lower across subgroups. intervention students had a lower increase in bmi (p=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted bmi (p<0.02) over time than controls. more respondents in the intervention (82%) than control (67%) area were aware of local health projects. among the dependent variables, walking showed some evidence of a positive linear trend across dose categories (p = 0.090). smoking prevalence declined (from 27.9% to 17.6%) in the intervention population. the community intervention hartslag limburg succeeded in preventing age- and time-related unfavorable changes in energy intake, fat consumption, walking, and bicycling, particularly among women and those with low ses. the female cohort in båtsfjord had a more favourable development when compared with changes in the control communities regarding the 11.2% increase in use of low-fat milk (p = 0.046), the increase in systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmhg (p = 0.024), and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmhg (p < 0.001). daily smoking had decreased by 0.9% in the intervention areas and by 2.6% in the control area at the end of the third year, but the difference was not significant. results indicated little consistent evidence of a treatment effect on physical activity knowledge, attitudes, or self-efficacy in either men or women. significant positive changes were observed in knowledge levels at a community level in the district of intervention compared with baseline knowledge levels particularly in relation to a heart healthy diet, beneficial level of physical activity, the causes of high blood pressure and heart attack and the effects of high blood pressure and active and passive smoking on health. there were no statistically significant program effects

each week, the difference was significant (p < .001). the median daily pruritus score did not change significantly during active or placebo treatment (preondansetron, 5. 3; interquartile range [iqr],

placebo and paroxetine was 0.78 local application of capsaicin depletes the peripheral neurons of substance p and may block the conduction of pain or pruritus. vas showed greater and more significant changes with naltrexone than with placebo (p<0.0003). naltrexone and 6 beta-naltrexol levels did not differ between patients and controls, and there was no significant association with treatment response. rifampin produced a 33% reduction in antipyrine plasma half-life, but no change in fasting total serum bile acids. no significant alterations were noted in the serum concentrations of standard laboratory variables, including lipids, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, or calcium, during treatment with either charcoal or placebo. the results of this study do not demonstrate that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is more effective than vehicle in relieving uremic pruritus. the pruritus improved considerably in four of the five treated patients, whereas only one of those treated with placebo experienced relief. there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to pruritus scores, quality-of-life scores, and severity of cutaneous scratch lesions. during the naltrexone period, pruritus decreased by 29.2% (95% confidence interval [ci], 18.7 to 39.6) on the vas and by 17.6% (95% ci, 4.2 to 31.1) on the detailed score. no serious treatment-related adverse reactions occurred. this safe, convenient and effective topical lotion may potentially benefit the large number of patients affected by pruritus associated with end-stage renal disease. gabapentin was associated with an increase in mean hsa, in contrast to the placebo, which was associated with a decrease. in conclusion, thalidomide can be a precious tool in the handling of uremic pruritus unresponsive to available therapy. uraemic pruritus is a common and distressing symptom in patients on haemodialysis for chronic renal failure. montelukast is more effective than placebo in the treatment of uremic pruritus not responding to the currently available antipruritus drugs, and it can be considered as a new and rather safe and effective treatment option in uremic patients. mean pruritus score using visual analogue scale and scratching activity were reduced on the first treatment day compared with baseline in both the ondansetron and placebo groups (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in mean pruritus perception or scratching activity between the two groups. although the geometric mean of tryptase had decreased in the cs group, this decrease was not statistically significant (p = 0.214). serum levels of intact pth did not correlate with the intensity of pruritus and did not significantly change during treatment with capsaicin or placebo. patients on antihistamines with or without doxepin had the highest incidence of side effects, although more of these patients reported a greater degree of relief than patients on pentoxifylline. no changes in biochemical tests or side effects were observed during this period. improvements in itching (p = 0.0025) and excoriations (p = 0.0060) were noted for the nalfurafine-treated patients. flumecinol did not significantly affect liver function tests, antipyrine clearance or serum total bile acids, and was not associated with any significant side-effects. after four weeks of treatment, the mean decrease in pruritus score in gabapentin and placebo groups was 6.7 +/- there was no significant difference in the mean vas scores after treatment, but naltrexone allowed a dramatic decrease in vas scores (delta >3/10) in 7 patients. plasma histamine levels were high (mean 2.32 the most common adr was insomnia (sleep disturbance), seen in 24 of the 226 nalfurafine patients. pruritus decreased by 16% (95% ci: 0.5-32%) during active treatment and by 25% (95% ci: 9-41%) during treatment with placebo. the success rate was significantly greater in the propofol group (84%) than in the placebo (16%) group (p less than 0.05). therapy with erythropoietin induced a decrease in plasma histamine concentrations in both groups of patients with uremia, and recurrences of pruritus after the discontinuation of erythropoietin were accompanied by increases in plasma histamine concentrations. sertraline seems to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for pruritus due to chronic liver disease. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 10 other patients with uraemic pruritus who were on chronic haemodialysis primary biliary cirrhosis with rifampin twenty patients with pruritus and

no significant difference was found between the two treatments with respect to total symptoms, score and visual analogue scale assessment. analysis indicated both drugs to be of equivalent potency and were equally well tolerated by patients. patients with limited previous withdrawals reported similar treatment effects on self-reports of sleep and sleepiness for gabapentin and lorazepam. other withdrawal symptoms disappeared more quickly in the sodium valproate group even though fewer patients were receiving chlormethiazole. differences in the polysomnographic variables of sleep continuitiy and sleep architecture at t0 and t1 found between the clomethiazole and the placebo patients correspond to rebound insomnia following discontinuation of clomethiazole. tetrabamate was found to be as efficient as chlordiazepoxide in reducing the intensity of the paws, improving sleep and vital signs rapidly and alleviating anxiety progressively. no differences were found in the need for rescue medication clo, decrease of withdrawal symptoms, or craving for alcohol between the oxc and the placebo group. there were no significant differences in demographics or substance use parameters between the divalproex group (n = 6) or the lorazepam group (n = 5). no statistically significant differences were found in efficacy between the two treatments, and both drugs were well tolerated. mean total milligrams of oxazepam received, progression of withdrawal symptoms, psychological distress as measured by the symptom checklist-90, side effects, and adverse outcomes were compared between groups. bromocriptine was ineffective in treating withdrawal symptoms, whilst chlormethiazole and chlordiazepoxide were equally effective. diazepam given under this regimen is a safe and effective sedative for management of combative patients with severe delirium tremens. lorazepam-treated patients had a significant rebound of alcohol withdrawal symptoms post-treatment (p =.007) and the risk of having a first drink was 3 times greater (p =.04) than for carbamazepine-treated patients. there was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (p greater than .05). no difference between the two drugs tested was found in the milder conditions, but barbital was found superior to diazepam in the treatment of fully developed delirium tremens. subjective and objective ratings of abstinence symptoms and subjective mood disturbance decreased significantly in intensity in both groups over 5 days, but there were no significant treatment differences nor treatment by time interactions. all active medications significantly reduced observer-rated and self-rated withdrawal severity, dysphoric mood, and supplementary diazepam administration compared with placebo. patients of both groups were similar in age, weight, duration of drinking, ingested quantities of alcohol and intensity of withdrawal symptoms in both groups. both itt and completer analyses revealed no significant differences between the groups considering the primary effectiveness measure: amount of clo required in the first 24 hours (p = 6.1 +/- on the whole a small tendency to more symptom items being reduced on piracetam in comparison with chlormethiazole was found. however, plasma catecholamines, blood pressure, and pulse rate fell more rapidly and to a greater extent during clonidine than following chlormethiazole, findings which could have therapeutic implications. symptom reduction occurred more rapidly and consistently in the depakote treated patients than in the benzodiazepine control group, and at six-week follow up a greater percentage of patients in the depakote maintenance group were completely abstinent than either detox-only group. there was no decrease in white blood counts under carbamazepine. all the patients receiving chlormethiazole had uneventful withdrawals. there was no difference between the three treatments in ratings of alcohol withdrawal symptoms nor requests for additional medication. in general, the drugs were found to be equally efficacious in treating the withdrawal syndrome and not significantly different with respect to side effects. there were no significant differences in the proportion of treatment completers between treatment groups or the proportion of patients in each group requiring rescue medication for breakthrough signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. levels of hva in the cerebrospinal fluid did not differ between the treatment groups and the controls and did not change during treatment. efficacy and safety were not different between groups (total group: delirium, 3.9%;

narcotic requirement (p<0.05), quicker reintroduction of diet and quicker return to normal activity <INPUT_END>  <punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> the laparoscopic group had a significant reduced postoperative narcotic requirement (p<0.05), quicker reintroduction of diet and quicker return to normal activity. the relative risk of removing a healthy appendix in open surgery was 6.6 relative risk (range, 2-21 c.i.) as compared with laparoscopy. laparoscopic appendectomy is comparable to open appendectomy with regard to complications, hospital stay, cost, return to activity, and return to work. laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform without affecting significantly the needs for postoperative analgesia, the duration of hospital stay and the time to return to normal activities when compared with open appendectomy in men. the outcome following laparoscopic appendicectomy for confirmed acute appendicitis is at least equivalent to that achieved with conventional appendicectomy. there was no significant difference in duration of sick leave after operation (laparoscopic group 11 days versus open group 14 days). when compared to open appendectomy the laparoscopic group had a longer median operating time (63 minutes versus 40 minutes), fewer wound infections (2% versus 11%), less requirement for narcotic analgesia, and an earlier return to normal activity (median 7 days versus 14 days). unlike other minimally invasive procedures, laparoscopic appendectomy did not offer a significant advantage over open appendectomy in all studied parameters except quality of life scores at 2 weeks. the oa group rendered a greater wound-complication rate and ileus than did the other two groups, but the differences were not detected between the three categories ( p = 0.065, 0.6935). there was no difference between groups for demographic data (particularly macroscopic aspect of appendix) analgesia, sedation, delay before eating and walking, incidence of urinary retention, nausea, vomiting. mean operative time was longer in the la group (p < 0.05). when the groups were compared according to the subgroups of gastro-intestinal quality of life index, except for disease-specific items, in all categories a significant improvement was seen in the laparoscopically treated patients. average postoperative length of stay without any complications was 6.2 +/-2.5 days in the open group and 4.3 +/- this occurred at an average of 25 days for the open appendectomy group versus 14 days for the laparoscopic appendectomy group (p < 0.001). the mean hospital stay for la was 3.23 days compared with 3.03 days for oa (p < 0.001). postoperative pain was significantly less in the la group on the 1st (p < 0.001) and 2nd (p < 0.001) postoperative day, resulting in less use of analgesics on both days (p < 0.001). there were five (9 per cent) wound infections after open appendicectomy compared with none after the laparoscopic operation (p < 0.01). wound infection incidence was lower in the laparoscopic group. wound infections were more common following oa (n = 11) than lal (n = 4) or las (n = 0) (p < 0.05, < 0.001). there were no statistically significant differences between the la and oa groups in operative risk: mean age, 28 +/- laparoscopic appendicectomy has higher direct costs than open operation and is not as cost-effective when the longterm outcome is the same in both groups. laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anaesthetic time (78 minutes versus 51) and operating time (49 minutes versus 23) compared with open appendectomy. laparoscopic appendectomy has no advantages in terms of convalescence and time to return to work when compared to open appendectomy and should therefore be limited to selected cases. the operating time seemed to be shorter for the oa patients than for the la patients, but the difference was not significant (la, 30 +/- there were no complications of laparoscopy. no positive blood cultures were demonstrated in the open operated group. the data from this prospective, randomized, double-blind study failed to demonstrate any significant reduction in lost workdays, postoperative pain, or operative time with laparoscopic appendectomy. the complication rate after open appendectomy (25.8%) was not significantly different from that after laparoscopic appendectomy (12.1%). functional status was significantly better in the la group 7-10 days after operation (p = 0.045). there was no significant difference in postoperative pain or fatigue, but return to normal life was faster in the la group (14 versus 26. 5 days). no statistically significant differences could be found with respect to surgical and general complications, operating time, consumption of analgesics and antibiotics, and return to work. laparoscopy was associated with no added complications, no increase in hospital stay in patients who went on to appendicectomy, and a reduction in hospital stay for those who underwent laparoscopy alone. in the post-operative period the counts of t-lymphocytes and monocytes expressing hla-dr were similar in both groups. in young women with right lower abdominal pain, laparoscopy can give precise diagnosis and reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. length of stay averaged 21.5 h for the laparoscopic group and was not statistically different when compared to the open group. laparoscopic appendectomy does not offer any proved benefits compared with the open approach for the routine patient with acute appendicitis. despite an increasing metabolic acidosis, prolonged carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum resulted in only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentrations, which was both statistically and clinically insignificant. laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform than open appendectomy (median, 107 vs 91 minutes; p <.01) and was associated with fewer days to return to a general diet (mean, 1.6 versus 2.3 days; p <.01), a shorter duration of parenteral analgesia (mean, 1.6 versus 2.2 days; p <.01), fewer morphine-equivalent milligrams of parenteral narcotic (median, 14 mg versus 34 mg; p =.001), a shorter postoperative hospital stay (mean, 2.6 versus 3.4 days; p <.01), and earlier return to full activity (median, 14 versus 21 days; p <.02). la is a more expensive alternative and offers no advantages related to pain relief, length of stay, return to normal activities, or morbidity. laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anesthetic time (72.5 minutes versus 55 minutes) and actual operating time (45 minutes versus 25 minutes) compared with open appendectomy. there were no differences in hospital stay or the postoperative course of the patients. there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the appearance of the appendix. there was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity rate in the two groups. we found that la is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer postoperative complications, and better diagnostic accuracy, and it is recommended as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. the risk of unnecessary appendicectomy was significantly (p = 0.03) lower after laparoscopy. laparoscopy was associated with fewer wound infections (p < 0.03) and improved cosmesis (p < 0.001), but the operating time was longer (60 versus 40 min). excess operating and complication costs per procedure were 96 euros (eur) in laparoscopic appendectomy. though laparoscopic appendectomy started endoscopic surgery in general surgery, it has yet not reached the acceptance as is the case with cholecystectomy. the operative time in la group was significantly (p < 0.001) longer (87.2 minutes) than for oa group (65.2 minutes). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> women with clinical signs of acute appendicitis female patients aged 15-45 years in whom an independent decision to

occurrence of febrile days, febrile episodes, the duration of antibiotic treatment, the number of sepsis in two groups. with regard to the side effects, there was no significant difference in the two groups. children receiving tmp-smx had fewer episodes of bacteremia (0 vs. 5) and otitis media (3 vs. 18). patients receiving ciprofloxacin also had fewer days of fever (average 6.5 days versus 9.8 days for the polymyxin b group, p less than 0.02). the number of days with fever > 38.5 degrees c was significantly higher in the control (vanco-) group than in the vanco+ group (7.4 vs. 3.7, p < 0.02). gram-positive and gram-negative infections were significantly less frequent in patients receiving pv, because of fewer infections with staphylococcus species and enterobacteriaceae. there were no differences between the two groups in age (mean 33 years, range 11-54), sex, diagnosis and mean duration of agranulocytosis (21.8 days, range 10-49). tms prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of c difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia. adverse reactions associated with co-trimoxazole/colistin required discontinuation of medication in 11/27 treatment courses because of compliance problems, skin reactions or gastrointestinal intolerance. although there was a trend toward a reduction in the overall incidence of bacteremia (12 v 4 patients), and gram-positive bacteremia (8 v 2 patients) with the addition of rifampin, none of these comparisons was statistically significant (p =.05 and p =.09, respectively). in conclusion, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in prevention of gram-positive bacteremias. ciprofloxacin recipients required fewer days of therapeutic antimicrobials (median: 28 antibiotic-days vs. 49, p0.02). the incidences of superficial skin and overall infections were significantly lower in those patients with multiple relapses who received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.008); however, there was no difference between the groups in regard to days of fever, days of antibiotic administration, days of hospitalization, or gram-negative rod bacteremia. st + cpfx was significantly effective than st alone (p < 0.005). ofloxacin was significantly better tolerated than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and shortened the duration of fever (p = 0.02) and of parenteral antimicrobial therapy for presumed or documented acquired infection (p = 0.01). no side effects that related to ofloxacin were noted. adverse events possibly related to the study drugs were slightly more common among the patients receiving the combination treatment (p = 0.05). trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in fewer microbiologically documented infections (seven versus 15; p = 0.029). norfloxacin was more effective than cotrimoxazole for preventing acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in surveillance cultures. significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (p less than 0.05). there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the time before the onset of the first fever, the number of episodes of fever or of septicaemia per patient, the number of neutropenic days during which patients remained afebrile or did not require systemic antibiotics, or the number of resistant organisms acquired. a decrease in the total number of acquired infections was found (16 infections in the group given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus 31 in the control group, p less than 0.01). among patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma, the prophylactic use of levofloxacin reduces the incidence of fever, probable infection, and hospitalization. no significant differences in survival, frequency of bacteremia, overall infections, use of systemic antimicrobial therapy, or adverse effects, including myelosuppression, were observed between patients receiving tmp-smz vs. those receiving placebo. prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones reduced the occurrence of infection in adult neutropenic patients without affecting the long-term survival. the number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). norfloxacin was better tolerated (30 of 36 versus 16 of 30 patients highly compliant, p = 0.02), and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (eight of 36 versus 14 of 36 patients, p = 0.07). the incidence of infection was higher in the trimethoprim group (50 percent) than in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (39 percent), but this did not reach statistical significance. there was no difference in the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease or incidence and duration of fever. the addition of vancomycin resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of patients with surveillance cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (stool cultures, 44 versus 23%; throat swab cultures, 37 versus 19%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (throat swab cultures, 90 versus 60%). prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated way of preventing febrile episodes and other relevant infection-related outcomes in patients with cancer and profound and protracted neutropenia. ciprofloxacin was therefore superior to the other two fluoroquinolones in preventing infections due to gram-negative bacteria in this population of neutropenic patients. four significant differences were observed between the group given tmp/stx (30 patients) and the control group (33 patients): 1) the mean duration of severe granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 500 pmn/mm3) before the first febrile episode was longer in prophylaxis group, 14.26 days versus four in the control group (p less than 0.001); 2) the number of febrile episodes was 37 in tmp/stx group and 69 in control group (p less than 0.01); 3) 23 patients on prophylaxis presented at least one febrile episode versus 33 in the control group (p less than 0.01); 4) deaths due to infection were two in the tmp/stx group versus 11 in control group (p less than 0.05). furthermore, side effects were fewer and compliance was better with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin. the use of therapeutic antibiotics was reduced (p = 0.013; 1-sided), with less hospitalizations due to fl (31 vs. 17 patients, p = 0.013: 1-sided). acquisition of gram-negative bacilli was more frequent among patients treated with nalidixic acid plus nystatin while filamentous fungi were acquired more frequently by patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin (p = 0.05). the incidence of febrile days and of days on parenteral antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in the group given tmp-smz and colistin (p less than 0.05). gram-positive cocci were isolated less frequently from tmp-smz-treated, bacteremic patients, but more of their isolates were resistant to tmp-smz than were those from placebo recipients. no statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms with respect to the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes as defined for this trial (79% for the norfloxacin group, 82% for the ofloxacin group, and 77% for the ofloxacin plus rifampin group). eleven of 16 microbiologically documented infections in the tmp/smx group and 7 of 11 in the nor group were caused by gram negative bacilli (gnb). group d streptococcus species were poorly suppressed by gn compared with gvn, although no patient developed an infection with these organisms. bacteraemia due to resistant gram-negative rods occurred only in the co-trimoxazole-colistin group though both regimens were effective for selective gastrointestinal tract decontamination. a decrease in the number of major acquired infections was observed: three infections occurred in 16 patients receiving the sam regimen compared with eight infections in 17 patients given the placebo. prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not significantly reduce the incidence of fever, hospitalization, or infection in granulocytopenic patients during consolidation chemotherapy. patients in group a had significantly more episodes of afebrile aplasia (34.5% vs 4%) and less bacteriemias (10% vs 48%) than those in group b. also fever developed later in group a (mean: 12.5 vs 6 days). the laf plus a patients had a significantly decreased incidence of total infection, bacteremias, pneumonias, rectal abscesses, urinary tract infection, and pharyngitis. there were no differences in the incidence of gram-positive infections nor in the length of hospitalization between the two treatment arms. this new combination antimicrobial regimen is safe and effective for prevention of gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia being treated with cytotoxic remission-induction chemotherapy. infections due to gram negative bacteria decreased to 33.3% in the ap group (vs. 92% in the control group), but infections due to gram positive bacteria increased to 66.7% (vs. 8% in the control group). the incidence of fever was not significantly different between episodes treated with tmz-e (18/27) and those treated with p (17/29), nor was there a significant difference in the median interval between the onset of neutropenia and the onset of fever. the death rate from infection was significantly reduced in patients who received antibiotics for gut flora suppression in conventional ward isolation compared with the corresponding control group. side effects were not significantly different, but compliance with ciprofloxacin was better. there was no statistical difference in the occurrence of documented septicemia, documented coccus gram-positive infections, or fever of unknown origins during aplasia in the 2 groups. both treatment groups acquired yeasts. only one infection caused by gram-negative bacilli was observed in the pefloxacin group compared with seven in the norfloxacin group (p = 0.019). prophylaxis was continued until the neutropenia resolved (granulocytes greater than 0.5.10(9)/l) or until the onset of infectious symptoms. this benefit was also associated with a 30% increase in the probability of failure-free survival at day 15 (p = 0.138). the use of quinolones was associated with a delay in the fever onset during neutropenia (p = 0.0448), a decrease in the proportion of neutropenic febrile days (p = 0.0456), a decrease of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli (p = 0.037) and an increase of streptococcus infections (p = 0.0857). although the frequency of oral thrush was greater (p = .02) in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (25.6%) than in the placebo group (6.3%), invasive fungal infection did not occur. fifteen patients in the control group developed febrile neutropenia versus 12 of those in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.69). no infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were seen in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.02). both drugs showed an effective elimination of gram-negative potential pathogens and staphylococcus aureus not affecting the anaerobic flora of the gastrointestinal tract. patients with initial leukopenia of grade who iii-i had only a 11% infection rate showing no significant difference between the treatment groups. the percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1, 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (p less than 0.01). 20% of the treated subjects versus 68.6% of the controls presented a subsequent infection (p less than 0.001), the lung representing the most frequent site of the infectious disease in both groups (3/6 and 14/24 respectively). incidence of infection at less than 100 granulocytes/microliters was significantly reduced in the tmp/smz group (2 infections/100 days) compared to placebo (11 infections/100 days, p = 0.005). clinically, the prophylactic efficacy was 92% for the oflx regimen and 40% for the control regimen (p less than 0.01). both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and ketoconazole substantially reduced the overall incidence of infection consequent to a marked decrease in bacterial infection. although there was no difference between the two arms in the proportion of patients developing fever or in the median number of days of fever, the time to onset of fever was a mean of 1 day longer in each patient on the pre-emptive arm (log rank p<0.001). there were significantly fewer overall infections (10 versus 3; p = 0.016) and streptococcal infections (9 versus 1; p = 0.0078) in the group receiving gram-positive prophylaxis. vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (p less than .002). no differences were noted between the two groups with respect to secondary outcome measures, including time to endpoint, occurrence of fever, type and number of microbiologically documented infections, and administration of intravenous antibiotics. fever or infection (without fever) developed in 190 (71%) of 268 evaluable patients in the penicillin arm compared with 213 (80%) of 268 evaluable patients in the placebo arm (p = .03; 95% confidence interval [ci] for the difference, -16% to -1%). prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin reduced the incidence of neutropenic fever in patients receiving hdt with asct, however, without affecting the total interval of hospitalization, time to engraftment, or all-cause mortality. no differences were noted between patients treated by pefloxacin and those who received a combination of pefloxacin with vancomycin regarding gram-positive (gram+) infections and infections with gram-negative (gram-) organisms usually resistant to pefloxacin. duration of more than a 39 degrees c fever was much longer in the nystatin group than in the norfloxacin group: bacteremia, microbiologically documented infections, and fever of unknown origin were more frequently seen in the nystatin group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. levofloxacin reduced the bacterial infections and delays the onset of fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia especially in short duration (< 7 days). ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. however, c + r combination prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of gram-positive bacteremia (five versus zero episodes) but was associated with a higher incidence of drug-related side effects. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be easily taken, to suppress the enterobacteriaceae, and to maintain the anaerobic rectal flora for biological stability of the rectal ecosystem. both aerobic gram-negative rods and streptococci which caused infection despite cotrimoxazole prophylaxis were resistant to cotrimoxazole. the compliance was better in group i but the treatment had to be modified in 9 patients of group i because of liver abnormalities.(abstract truncated at 250 words) only two gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in the cip + col arm compared with 16 in the neo + col arm. three significant differences were observed between the co-trmoxazole and the control groups: (i) 15 of the 16 (94%) control patients but only 8 of the 14 (57%) patients on co-trimoxazole developed infections and required additional antibiotics intravenously; (ii) although the duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.1 times 10(9)/1) was similar in the two groups, control patients required intravenous antibiotics on average after 2 days of neutropenia, whereas patients receiving co-trimoxazole required these only after 12 days; and (iii) the only 2 patients who died of infection were in the control group. <INPUT_END>

p = .01). this reduction was more evident in the second trimester (-14%, p < 0.001) than in the third (-8%, p = 0.107) and was strongest in women who were most compliant (those who consumed > or = 75% calcium pills; -24%, p < 0.001), had baseline blood lead > 5 microg/dl (-17%, p < 0.01), or reported use of lead-glazed ceramics and high bone lead (-31%, p < 0.01). calcium did not reduce the numbers of preterm deliveries, small-for-gestational-age births, or fetal and neonatal deaths; nor did it increase urolithiasis during pregnancy. calcium supplementation was associated with a significantly decreased risk of preeclampsia (risk reduction 12.35%; p < .001), with 3.2% (n = 4) developing preeclampsia in the treatment group versus 15.5% (n = 21) in the placebo group. treatment with calcium reduced the risk of preeclampsia (relative risk 0.44 [95% ci, 0.21-0.90], p = 0.02) and the risk of preterm birth (relative risk 0.44 [95% ci, 0.21-0.90], p = 0.02). the rate of pregnancy induced hypertension was lower in the calcium group than in the placebo group 8.24%;

and grade iv hemorrhoids. no significant difference was identified between the two groups in terms of operation time, blood loss, day of first bowel movement after surgery, and complication rates. stapled haemorrhoidectomy is an effective treatment for third degree haemorrhoids with significant advantages for patients compared with conventional haemorrhoidectomy. the stapled group had a shorter operating time, less frequent postoperative analgesia intake, shorter hospital stay and earlier return to normal activity. the stapled group experienced significantly less pain (mean number of analgesic tablets 2.60 vs. 15.9) and returned to normal activity sooner (8.04 vs. 16.9 days), as reported by other authors. hemorrhoidectomy with a circular staple device is easy to perform and achieves better results than the milligan-morgan technique in terms of postoperative pain and recovery. postoperative pain was significantly lower in group b (p <0.001). postoperative pain at rest and during defecation was less important after pph if no resection of external piles or skin tags was associated (p < 0.0001). seven patients in the stapled group re-presented with prolapse compared with none in the conventional haemorrhoidectomy group (p = 0.004). stapled hemorrhoidectomy may be associated with less pain and faster recovery than conventional hemorrhoidectomy for prolapsing hemorrhoids. closed hemorrhoidectomy proved to be superior for bleeding control (95.1 percent closed hemorrhoidectomy 80.5 percent stapled rectal mucosectomy; p= 0.04). in the early days after operation, patients in group 2 had greater difficulty in maintaining normal continence to liquid stools (p = 0.01), but after 30 days the continence score was better in group 2 (p = 0.04). primary end points were acute postoperative pain, and hemorrhoid symptom recurrence requiring additional treatment at one-year follow-up from surgery. sh was superior to fh in operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain intensity, and return to work. impaired sphincter function was observed at 1 year with no significant difference between the groups for urgency (12%), continence problems (10%), or tenesmus (3%). stapled hemorrhoidectomy offers several advantages over excision hemorrhoidectomy, including reduced postoperative pain, a reduced hospital stay, and an earlier recovery time. at 1 year there were no significant differences in the symptom load, symptom severity or the disease severity between the two groups. stapled hemorrhoidopexy was not effective as a definitive cure for the symptoms of prolapse and itching in patients with fourth-degree hemorrhoids. the circular transanal stapled technique for the treatment of haemorrhoids has the potential to offer a less painful rectal procedure in place of ablative perianal surgery. operation time for open hemorrhoidectomy using ligasure was shorter [median 13 (range 9.2-16.1) min vs 15 (range 8-17) minutes, p < 0.05].

follow-up 0.59: p = 0.04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44.7%; follow-up 66.8%, p = 0.02). statistically significant differences in retention (f(3,158)=3.78, p<.02), in longest period of consecutive urine samples negative for methamphetamine metabolites (f(3,158)=11.80, p<.001), and in the treatment effectiveness score were observed by condition during treatment (f(3,158)=7.35, p<.001) with post hoc analyses showing the cm and cbt+cm conditions to perform better than standard cbt. subsequent to the "stay healthy" module, number of positive lifestyle changes and active coping styles increased more often among females who attended the intervention condition than among those in the control condition. compared with the standard intervention, fewer men assigned to the enhanced intervention reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a negative or unknown-serostatus partner at 3 months (21 versus 26%, p < 0.05). cognitive behavioral intervention programs can effectively reduce the potential of hiv transmission to others among plh who report significant transmission risk behavior. a novel counseling intervention focusing on self-justifications significantly decreased the proportion of participants reporting uai with nonprimary partners of unknown or discordant hiv status at 6 and 12 months (from 66% to 21% at 6 months and to 26% at 12 months, p =.002; p <.001) as compared with a control group when added to standard client-centered hiv counseling and testing. significant differences in sexual health behaviours were observed across locations and across time, but the only significant intervention effects were amongst men who had direct contact with the intervention, with higher uptake of hepatitis b vaccination and hiv testing. chinese and filipino men further benefited from the intervention: treatment subjects from these two ethnic groups reduced unprotected anal intercourse at follow-up by more than half when compared to their counterparts (odds ratio = 0.41; 95% ci, 0.19-0.89; p = 0.024). in the post-intervention period, the 3 groups did not differ in the incidence of sexual activity or in the proportion who slipped up at least once, but the self-justifications group were less likely to have had multiple slip-ups. the opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. analyses indicated significant reductions in paid, unprotected sexual intercourse and oral sex following the intervention. at the community level, movement toward consistent condom use with main (p < .05) and nonmain (p < .05) partners, as well as increased condom carrying (p < .0001), was greater in intervention than in comparison communities. in sessions providing skills training, condom use increased, on average, by 44% between pre-test and second follow-up compared with only 11% on average in sessions which did not provide such training. risk reduction in the pcc arm was sustained from 6 to 12 months at 1.9 (p = 0.181), whereas risk significantly decreased in the uc arm to 2.2 during this interval (p < 0.001 vs. 6 months; p = 0.756 vs. pcc at 12 months). the intervention to reduce risk of hiv transmission resulted in significantly less unprotected intercourse and greater condom use at follow-up. this behavioural intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver, but it did not reduce the risk of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection among these gay men at high risk. the percentage who engaged in ui with multiple partners reduced from 31.5 to 12.9% (p = 0.02). among participants who had two or more sex partners at baseline, uav was reduced 38% (p < 0.001) among those who received the loss-frame intervention. hiv risky behaviors and health practices were examined among young people living with hiv (yplh) in los angeles, san francisco, and new york over 15 months in response to receiving a preventive intervention. although levels of risk within each wave were never significantly different between the two treatment groups, reductions in unprotected anal intercourse (uai) with a nonmonogamous partner for both groups from the baseline wave-1 levels were uniformly significant (all p's < .05). donors randomized to the structured intervention program did not report significantly more behavior change at the 1-year follow-up. we describe the intervention tested in explore, an hiv prevention trial aimed at men who have sex with men (msm), and test the empirical basis of the individually tailored intervention. at eight weeks, those attending the group reported significant gains over their control in making sexual choices, physical safety, hiv and sti transmission knowledge, and sexual negotiation skills. relative to the comparison group, both the cognitive-behavioral and social support group therapies produced reductions in depression, hostility, and somatization. no significant changes occurred in the comparison community over the same period. testing behavioral interventions to increase safer sex practices of hiv+ individuals has the potential to significantly reduce the number of new infections. at the time of this writing, no randomized controlled trial (rct) of an intervention to reduce unsafe sex among latino gay and bisexual men (lgbm) had been published. in both conditions, a significant decrease occurred in a range of problems from intake to the 6-month interview, followed by no significant pattern of change at 12- and 18-month interviews. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> nine hundred thirty-six hiv-infected participants considered to be at risk of transmitting hiv of 3818 persons screened hiv-seropositive gay and bisexual men gay men in a small city to serve as behavior change endorsers to their peers participants with casual partners at baseline depressed, hiv-infected persons depressed persons with hiv infection people living with hiv infection 343 gay men with an acute sexually transmitted infection or who reported having had unprotected anal intercourse in the past year homosexual asian and pacific islander men 329 self-identified homosexual api recruited in san francisco between 1992 and 1994 people living with hiv five-hundred and eighty-five hiv-positive persons, sexually active prior to enrollment male prostitutes and other patrons in new york city "hustler" bars sixty-eight depressed men with hiv infection young people living with hiv (yplh) in los angeles, san francisco, and new york over 15 months in response to receiving a preventive intervention abusing patients with hiv/aids in a public general hospital received a participants were 248 msm with a history of at least one previous negative hiv test result and self-reported uai (receptive or insertive) in the previous 12 months with partners of unknown or discordant hiv status 162 methamphetamine-dependent (scid-verified) gbm in los angeles county gay men (n=92) who had slipped up kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks men patronizing gay clubs in the intervention city and in two matched comparison cities hiv-negative men young men who have sex with men (ymsm) in st. petersburg, russia and sofia, bulgaria 23 sexual health clinics in london, we determined that few participants had attended other sexual health clinics young gay men new york city in which 180 lgbm people living with hiv (plh men with hiv gay men undergoing substance use disorder treatment 271 hiv-infected persons who donated blood to the new york blood center substance abusers with hiv/aids african-american homosexual and bisexual men urban gay and bisexual men hiv-positive patients presenting with risky behavioral profiles anonymous testing site in san francisco, california, between may 1997 and january 2000 substance-using hiv-positive young people homosexual api men who have sex with men (msm hiv-infected youths hiv-negative men who have sex with men (msm;

<INPUT_END>  <punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> at follow-up, 45% of girls in the intervention schools and 36% of girls in the control schools reported vigorous physical activity during an average of 1 or more 30-minute time blocks per day over a 3-day period. however, for the majority of outcome variables, differences between intervention and control schools at postintervention and follow-up were not statistically significant. in addition, girls in the active intervention groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages by 34%, increased their level of moderate-to-vigorous activity by 12%, and increased their serving; of water by 1.5%. following the program champion-directed intervention, girls in intervention schools were more physically active than girls in control schools (mean difference 10.9 met-weighted minutes of mvpa, 95% ci=0.52-21.2). building community capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity appears to be a safe and effective way to reduce unhealthy weight gain in children without increasing health inequalities. a multicomponent school-based intervention can be effective in preventing the development of overweight among children in grades 4 through 6 in urban public schools with a high proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-priced school meals. positive effect on adiposity indices (except tsf) was observed in boys (p<0.001 for bmi z), while both physical fitness parameters increased significantly in both boys (p<0.001 for each test) and girls (p<0.0001 for each test). percentage of adolescents meeting recommended health guidelines was significantly improved for girls for consumption of saturated fat (intervention vs control change, 23.4% to 41.0% vs 18.5% to 31%, respectively [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.68]) and for boys' participation in d/wk of pa (intervention vs control change, 45.3% to 55.4% vs 41.9% to 38.0%, respectively [relative risk, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.75]). eating habits at home were found to be healthier among families with children in intervention schools at the end of the intervention. cross-sectional comparisons at baseline indicated lower physical activity, self-efficacy for physical activity and aerobic fitness and a higher bmi in children with high screen time. parental involvement did not increase intervention effects. children in the bm/fms group were less likely than controls to be overweight/obese between baseline and post intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aor)=0.36, p<0.05); also maintained at 12-month follow-up (aor=0.38, p<0.05). interventions aimed to improve health-related behaviours had significant effects on the age-dependent increases in median triceps skinfolds of the whole group (from 10.9 to 11.3 mm in "intervention schools" vs from 10.7 to 13.0 mm in "control schools", p<0.01) as well as in percentage fat mass of overweight children (increase by 3.6 vs 0.4% per year without and with intervention, respectively; p<0.05). no changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure were associated with the intervention in either sex, except for an increase in diastolic blood pressure (1.55 mm hg; 95% ci 0.19-2.91; p=0.03) in the intervention versus control boys. no significant differences between groups were found for bmi. in contrast, in boys only bmi z-score (p < 0.001) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001) were affected. multilevel analyses showed that the intervention remained effective in preventing unfavorable increases in important measures of body composition after 20-month follow-up in girls (biceps skinfold and sum of 4 skinfolds) and boys (triceps, biceps, and subscapular skinfolds). at follow-up, compared with boys in the active comparison group, boys in the intervention group displayed a smaller increase in bmi (adjust diff.=-0.2, 95% confidence interval [ci] -0.78, 0.39; cohen's d=0.05); greater reductions in waist circumference (-1.65 cm [-4.67, 1.36]; d=0.15); percentage body fat (-1.69% [-4.98, 1.60]; d=0.22) and time spent in small screen recreation on weekends (-1.13 h [-5.06, 2.80]; d=0.19); and a greater increase in cardiorespiratory fitness (2.13 laps [6.22, 10.48]; d=0.16); and participation in total weekday physical activity (140.74 counts/min [-159.44, 440.92]; d=0.36). overall results at the end of the 12-week program demonstrated substantial, although not significant, differences between treatment and control groups in the hypothesized directions. no differences in self-reported pa emerged between the intervention and control groups at weeks 1 (baseline) and 12 (postintervention). children from intervention schools spent less time on screen-viewing activities after the intervention but these differences were imprecisely estimated: mean difference in minutes spent on screen viewing at the end of the intervention (intervention schools minus control schools) adjusted for baseline levels and clustering within schools was -11.6 significant improvements in nutrition knowledge were seen in all children (p<0.01) between baseline and post-intervention, and results were highly significant in the nutrition and combined group (p<0.001). the effect sizes of the differences between treatment and control groups ranged between small (cohen's d = 0.15 for body mass index at 6 months post-intervention) to large (1.38; parent report of screen time at 6 months post-intervention), controlling for baseline levels. in a 2-y intervention targeting increased physical activity and healthy eating in primary school children, the adjusted body mass index (bmi) z score was 0.26 units (95% ci: 0.21, 0.32) lower in intervention than in control children. the group by time interactions were significant for fitness (p < 0.01) and %bf (p < 0.05). consumption of ssbs decreased by 82% in the intervention group and did not change in the control group. children playing kalèdo showed a significant increase in nutrition knowledge (p<0.05) and in weekly vegetable intake (p<0.01) with respect to the control. the percentage of children watching television/videos more than 2 h/d also decreased significantly from 33% to 18% among the intervention group, compared with an increase of 41% to 47% among the control group, for a difference of -21.5% (95% confidence interval, -42.5% to -0.5%; p =.046). the diminution of insulin levels was more significant in the overweight group (p < 0.007). girls in control schools had significant increases in percentage of risk of overweight or overweight from third (26%) to fifth (39%) grades, as did girls in catch schools (30%-32%); however, the rate of increase for girls in the catch schools was significantly lower (2%) compared with the rate for control girls (13%). parents in the increased fruit and vegetable group showed significantly greater decreases in percentage of overweight than parents in the decreased high-fat/high-sugar group. the intervention had positive, significant effects on percentage bmi-for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight, bmi, and percentage body fat for parents. int children had a 20% greater increase in fitness and a 5.7% smaller increase in bp compared with children attending up schools (p<0.05). schools with > or =75 min of physical activity across the curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in body mass index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of physical activity across the curriculum after two years, there was a trend for the children exposed to the pe intervention to have lower levels of body fat, but the differences were not significant. group allocation had no significant effect on the primary outcome measure at six and 12 months or on measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour by accelerometry. compared with controls, participants in the intervention groups achieved their nutritional targets for fat intake and to a smaller extent for sugar and complex carbohydrate intake, leading to a decrease in energy intake (children, p < .001; parents, p = .02). the intervention group significantly (p = 0.013) reduced its intake of artificial juice, which is prohibited by the act. each field center developed its own intervention(s) and corresponding control, and tailored its study to the specific hypothesis being tested. this study population stabilized their bmi sds (p < 0.025). intervention children showed a higher score for knowledge, attitudes, and self reported behaviour for healthy eating and physical activity. analysis of post-data shows significant positive shifts (p = 0.01) in bmi in the intervention group compared with the comparison group. after intervention, prevalence of overweight, bmi z-score and change in bmi z-score were

<punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> no difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. with the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the mdi-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or fev1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by mdi-spacer. mdi-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children. additionally, the neb group presented a higher incidence of tremor (p=.03) and anxiety (p=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol. the mean percentage of improvement in fvc and fev1 in the a group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively. the cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001). fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ed (9% vs 20%, p < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, p < .001). there were no differences between groups in the score over time, or secondary outcome measures. during the asthma attacks, the odn group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000). the baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma. no significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered. there was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma. less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure). both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both fvc and fev1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment. pefr increased significantly in both the groups after completion of treatment, but pefr was not statistically significant when compared in between groups. all three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted pefr. no significant difference in bronchodilation was seen between groups a and b. fenoterol through a spacer can replace inhalation in adult asthma patients with non-severe obstruction. large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe. the improvement from baseline at 30 min in the clinical score was 1.87 for jn and 1.43 for pmdi (p=0.09) and at 60 min was 2.15 for jn and 1.12 for pmdi (p=0.0001). there was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. the mdi and spacer combination was a cost-effective alternative to a nebulizer in the delivery of albuterol to young children with moderate and severe acute asthma. the 6-h area under the curve fev1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> acute asthma in children forty patients (forced expiratory volume in 1 s [fev1]: 1.15 33 children (6 to 14 years of age) with forced

weight gain of pregnant women who were overweight and reducing clinical complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, infant low weight, and prematurity in the intervention group. significant differences (p = .03) were found between study groups in the percentage of women who perceived their health status as "very good"; the values that corresponded to the exercise group (n = 18; 54.5%) were better than those of the control group (n = 9; 27.3%). finally, urine ketones increased significantly (p less than 0.02) in the calorie-restricted group, whereas they remained absent in the control group.(abstract truncated at 250 words) omnibus manova showed statistically significant differences between the study and control groups regarding 3 variables: (1) gestational hypertension, p < .46; (2) mother's last weight before delivery, p < .001; and (3) mother's 6-week postpartum weight, p < .001. energy restriction did not alter the frequency of insulin therapy (17.5% in the intervention group and 16.9% in the control group). fat intake, specifically saturated fat intake, decreased and protein intake increased from the first to the third trimester in the passive and active groups compared with an opposite change in the control group. women in the exercise group were approximately 5 times more likely than those in the control group to have regular or good cardiorespiratory capacity (12/38 versus 2/38; relative risk 5.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 22.0, number needed to treat 5). thus, altering the source of maternal dietary carbohydrate may prove to be a valuable tool in the management of pregnancies at risk for anomalous feto-placental growth and for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and insulin resistance in the non-pregnant state. no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups in adherence to iom guidelines, rate of cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, gdm, operative vaginal delivery, or vaginal lacerations. the mean diet gi fell significantly in the lgi group but not in the hgi group. average gestational weight gain was 14.02, 15.27 and 16.22 kg in the three ep, epp and comparison groups respectively, and average weight retention at six months post partum was 2.34, 4.06 and 5.08 kg in the three groups, respectively. the offspring of the women who were randomly assigned to a high volume of exercise in mid and late pregnancy were significantly lighter (3.39 kg vs 3.81 kg) and thinner (8.3% fat vs 12.1% fat) than those offspring born of women who were randomly assigned to reduce their exercise volume after the 20th week. a low-glycemic index diet is effective as a treatment for individuals with diabetes and has been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes when used from the first trimester. the intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes (6 versus 29%, or 0.17 95% ci 0.03-0.95, p = 0.04). there were no significant differences in birth weight z score or other measures of infant adiposity between groups. a low-intensity behavioral intervention during pregnancy reduced excessive gestational weight gains in nw women and prevented postpartum weight retention in nw and ow/ob women. the intervention significantly decreased the percentage of normal-weight women who exceeded the iom recommendations (33 vs 58%, p<0.05). however, insulin resistance (homa-ir) did not differ between the groups. both s-insulin and s-leptin were reduced by 20% in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 27, mean difference: -16 pmol l(-1) better glucose tolerance in the diet/probiotics group was confirmed by a reduced risk of elevated glucose concentration compared with the control/placebo group (or 0.31 (95 % ci 0.12, 0.78); p = 0.013) as well as by the lowest insulin concentration (adjusted means 7.55, 9.32 and 9.27 mu/l; p = 0.032) and homeostasis model assessment (adjusted means 1.49, 1.90 and 1.88; p = 0.028) and the highest quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (adjusted means 0.37, 0.35 and 0.35; p = 0.028) during the last trimester of pregnancy. neonatal birthweight was lower in the intervention than in the usual care group (absolute effect size -133 g, 95% ci -231 to -35, p = 0.008) as was proportion of large-for-gestational-age (lga) newborns (26/216, 12.1% versus 34/179, 19.7%, p = 0.042). the values of the ogtt during the second trimester did not differ between the lifestyle intervention and close follow-up groups. regular weight measurement in pregnancy was not found to be effective in reducing weight gain, except among women who were overweight but not obese before pregnancy. nutrition knowledge improved significantly over time in both groups but more so in the video doctor

perceived "general well-being," exercise capacity, functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the vvir than in dual rate-responsive modes. 2.2 liters/min, p = 0.0001) where significantly greater in the ddd mode. the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide was significantly lower in dddr mode (p=0 x 002). the observed annual rates of death from all causes and of hospitalization for heart failure were lower among the patients with a physiologic pacemaker than among those with a ventricular pacemaker, but not significantly so (annual rates of death, 6.6 percent with ventricular pacing and 6.3 percent with physiologic pacing; annual rates of hospitalization for heart failure, 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively). quality of life improved significantly after pacemaker implantation (p<0.001), but there were no differences between the two pacing modes in either the quality of life or prespecified clinical outcomes (including cardiovascular events or death). despite similar heart rate changes during acute physiological stresses, a higher blood pressure was recorded during aair or dddr pacing compared with vvir pacing. the patients reported significantly less breathlessness, fatigue, and dizziness and a significantly greater sense of general well-being during ddd pacing than during vvi pacing. significant improvement in the mean total quality-of-life score (20.5 +/- there was significantly less chest pain with this mode than with either of the other modes. exercise performance and borg scores were significantly worse during vvi pacing compared with vvir or ddd pacing but did not significantly differ between vvir and ddd modes. no significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. symptomatic assessment (by diary card and monthly symptom scores) of "shortness of breath", "palpitation", and "general well-being" was significantly improved during the physiological pacing mode. the most highly significant (p less than 0.005) were shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, pulsations in the neck or abdomen, cough, and apprehension. paced ventricular rate was, however, higher and variation in paced rate greater in ddd compared to vvi,r pacing. variability of left and right atrial and left ventricular bloodflow was studied using transthoracic and transesophageal doppler echocardiography and related to pacemaker mode preference during everyday activity. arterial lactate, respiratory rates and perceived exertion ratings during submaximal levels of exercise were higher on ventricular inhibited pacing, as well as symptoms scored during the two 3-week periods. <INPUT_END>
