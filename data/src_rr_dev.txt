however, structural equation modeling supported the self-determination process model of smoking cessation. at one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. outpatient medical practices assigned to the immediate intervention (experimental) condition were trained to deliver brief quit-smoking advice and counseling. there was a small but significant reduction of breath co in the patients seen at home by the health visitor but the urinary cotinine concentrations were unchanged. thirty five patients in the treatment group were abstinent at three years compared with eight in the control group (p less than 0.001). among the 208 smokers in the intervention group there were more attempts to quit, and they were more successful than in the 216 smokers in the control group. the prevalence of smokers did not differ significantly at baseline (32.9% and 32.4%, p=0.75). none of the interventions had any effect on point prevalence of quitting as determined 8-9 months later by self-report. using complete case analysis, the tailored letters intervention was significantly more effective than brief advice for 24-hour [odds ratio (or) = at one-year follow-up, 7.5% of smokers in the minimal advice group who had quit for six or more months remained non-smokers compared with 3.2% in the control group. significantly more smokers in the experimental group made a quit attempt (44.9% versus 36.5%) and actually quit smoking than in the control group (16.0% versus 8.8%). the intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. intervention group patients made significantly more quit attempts than did those in the control group (p less than .001), which was similar to the comparison group. at the 6-month follow-up, there was no significant difference in quit rates between the usual care (11.9%) and intervention (14.4%) groups, and there was no significant difference between the usual care (13.6%) and intervention (13.3%) groups at the 12-month follow-up. no significant differences were found in the three measures used to determine outcome--desire to stop smoking, an attempt to stop and success in stopping--between the control and intervention groups. in no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (p less than 0.05) level. prolonged abstinence rates among abnormal pft subjects (3.7%) did not differ from those of normals (5.9%). the ncg group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). after one year 72% of smokers replied to a postal follow up questionnaire: 11% of the control group claimed to have stopped smoking compared with 15% in the group that received advice alone, 17% in the exhaled carbon monoxide group, and 13% in the health visitor group. this study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking.|family practice patients general medical practice 6052 adult patients who consulted their doctors in six oxfordshire general practices between october 1980 and february 1981, 2110 (35%) were smokers 413 males and 76 females patients abstained from smoking for only a few hours before attending the 'stop smoking' clinic 369 individuals designated by study design for referral, only 14% even investigated the classes 1392 patients sixty four patients attended the educational consultation and first follow up visit;

3% per month in period 3. contact with case managers was not significantly associated with utilization of ambulatory care (or, 0.77 [ci, 0.57 to 1.04]), hospitalization (or, 1.13 [ci, 0.84 to 1.54]), or emergency department visits ( the adjusted odds of hospitalization were lower for patients in clinics with extended hours (or = 0.77, 95% ci = 0.63, 0.93) and for patients in clinics with four or more accessibility features compared with those in clinics with less than two features (or = 0.67; 95% ci = 0.50, 0.89). the process of care for hospitalized patients with pcp in these two institutions differed considerably, but the survival rates were not significantly different, even after adjusting for confounding factors. among va patients, black and hispanic patients were not significantly different from white patients with regard to in-hospital mortality rates, use and timing of a bronchoscopy, or receipt of timely anti-pcp medications. we found that for federal health programme clients in need of ancillary services, a positive relationship existed between their receipt of ancillary services and their access to primary medical care (p </= 0.001). experience and survival were not significantly associated in the early study years (1989-1990). persons on prophylaxis had 20% lower adjusted odds of developing pcp (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.64, 0.99). the prenatal care assistance program appeared to be successful in reducing the incidence of low birth weight and preterm delivery in this high-risk population. hospital admissions were fewer (aids patients, rr = 0.67; hiv-positive patients without aids, rr = 0.45), and length of stay was briefer, compared with patients at the other kaiser permanente medical centers. the association of enhanced prenatal care with greater ed use was curbed for women with more timely and adequate prenatal care visits or a usual source of prenatal care. active patients also had longer survival than inactive patients when stratified by cd4+ t-cell levels or by clinical status. the average length of a hospital inpatient stay was halved for those patients who had participated in the project for two years, and the average number of visits to the outpatient clinic per month fell for patients with aids. the study's principal finding was that specific ancillary services were significantly associated with an increase in an individual's likelihood of entering medical care and maintaining appropriate medical care services for hiv, particularly when the services addressed a corresponding need. length of stay and intensive care unit use were also significantly higher at low-experience hospitals after controlling for severity of illness (p < .05). patients in clinics with more than one feature promoting accessibility or hiv expertise had a greater reduction in their aor of repeated ed use. there were no significant differences in patient outcome as measured by functional status and patients' self-ratings of physical condition at hospital discharge. adjusted odds ratios (aors) of acceptable antiretroviral therapy were higher (p < .05) for hiv specialty care (aor = 1.71 for one or

intervention arm, relative to the control group, in the combined sample of baseline smokers and nonsmokers (odds ratio [ not smoking cessation and reduction outcomes were significantly better than those of the brief intervention. seventeen percent of the smokers enrolled in the clinics had reports of having quit smoking for at least the last 30 days at 3-month follow-up (5 months after the program quit day), compared to only 8% of the control condition smokers over than same time period. despite the lack of a treatment effect, a large majority of adolescents in both treatment groups reduced their consumption to a few cigarettes per day or less and maintained this reduction over time. those who participated in the program were significantly more likely than controls to report at the immediate post-intervention assessment that they had abstained from smoking during the past week (p<or=.01), smoked fewer days in the past week (p<or=.001), smoked fewer cigarettes in the past week (p<or=.01), and considered themselves a former smoke (p<or=.05). at 3-month follow-up, only those in mi showed cotinine levels that were significantly reduced compared to baseline. the mi intervention resulted in significant short-term reductions in quantity and frequency of smoking relative to standard care, however, effects were not maintained at 3- and 6-month follow-up. among teenagers who were available at follow-up, a medium effect size (cohen's h = .38) was found for reduction and a large effect size (cohen's h = .69) was found for percentage reduction, although these results also were not statistically significant. among participants who continued to smoke, sos was associated with a significantly greater reduction in average number of days smoked than boi (p=0.006). health risk appraisal, when accompanied by feedback counseling, was an effective health promotion tool to help prevent nonsmokers from acquiring the habit and to modify cigarette smoking behavior among college freshmen. although treated participants improved more in tobacco related knowledge relative to controls (p = 0.002), there were no group differences in changes in attitudes toward smoking. mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean: 78.4-82.8%) than for the gum (mean: 38.5-50.7%). sustained abstinence, reflecting 7-day abstinence at both time points, in the self-help and counseling arms was 7% and 9% (p = .59). mi was more effective than ba for adolescents with little or no intention to change their smoking, but was actually less effective for adolescents with pre-existing intention to cut down or quit smoking. during treatment, confirmed point prevalence rates were significantly higher for 300 mg than placebo at every week except week 4. there was also generally strong evidence of intervention impact for 3-month, 1-month, and 7-day abstinence and duration since last cigarette (p = .09, .015, .01, and .03, respectively). a greater proportion of participants in the treatment condition (n = 26) reported cessation attempts and point abstinence than did control participants (n = 28) at all time points. further, nicotine dependence

treatment group, did report more pain than older children. we compared the procedural coping and distress behavior of 31 3- to 7-year-old children trained in coping skills to 30 who did not receive training. distraction was found to significantly decrease pain whereas suggestion did not. children in the maternal distraction condition exhibited significantly less distress during the immunization injection than those in the reassurance and control conditions. the present study sought to reduce children's distress during aversive medical procedures using a brief, cost-effective intervention aimed at reframing memory. prepared children reported significantly less pain, and radial pulse rates confirmed that they were less distressed by the procedure. results also indicated that children reported more anxiety and exhibited more behavioral distress in the cb group than in the hypnosis group. distraction resulted in more nurse coaching and child coping and less child distress than did emla or typical care on an observational measure. experimental group parents used significantly more distraction than did control group parents during both phases (p < 0.001). results confirmed that patients in the local anesthetic plus hypnosis group reported less anticipatory anxiety and less procedure-related pain and anxiety and that they were rated as demonstrating less behavioral distress during the procedure. children who were taught to blow out air during their shots had significantly fewer pain behaviors (p < .04) and demonstrated a trend toward lower subjectively reported pain (p = .06). univariate post hoc tests confirmed that the experimental group perceived less pain and demonstrated less behavioral distress than the control group. self-reported pain and fear were highly correlated (p < .001) but not significantly different between the two groups. results indicate that, in the two intervention conditions, children coped more and were less distressed, nurses and parents exhibited more coping promoting behavior and less distress promoting behavior, and parents and nurses were less distressed than in the control condition. patients in the hypnosis groups reported less pain and anxiety and were rated as demonstrating less behavioral distress than those in the control groups. although vas pain scores were not statistically different between the two

p = 0.06 for lng 125 compared with lng 0, and p < 0.05 for lng 250 and lng 500 compared with lng 0). there were no changes in blood count, lipid profile, liver function tests, prostate-specific antigen (psa), sex hormone binding globulin (shbg), prolactin or cortisol. suppression was slower in group ii, which also demonstrated more frequent escape from gonadotrophin suppression than groups i and iii. there were no significant changes in body weight, hemoglobin, hematocrit, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations during treatment. serum hdl cholesterol levels declined significantly in both groups (percentage decline month 6 of treatment vs baseline: 12.0% +/- there were no significant changes in lipoprotein or haemoglobin concentrations in any group. t enanthate (300 mg/week), was no more effective than 100 mg/week in suppressing lh, fsh, and sperm production. in the group receiving only 19nt-hpp, serum lh and fsh were markedly suppressed and remained low during the treatment phase. consistent azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia was achieved and maintained in all volunteers during the treatment period, except for two men in the tu-alone group who experienced a rebound in sperm concentrations. in the t patch-only group, serum shbg was not suppressed, and total serum t was higher than baseline levels. there was no consistent difference in mean lh and fsh levels among the three groups during treatment or recovery, except that fsh remained detectable in a higher proportion of samples from the group receiving 300 microg dsg with 50 mg t enanthate. 3.6% in men given t plus lng (p < 0.05), compared to only a 1.8 +/- tu 1000 mg im alone or with nete at 8-weekly intervals resulted in linear increases in average concentration and auc of serum total and free t with each injection. there were no significant changes in lipoproteins, fibrinogen or sexual behaviour during treatment, and minor falls in haematocrit and haemoglobin concentration. inhibin-alpha and the spermatocyte marker acrosin-binding protein were significantly lower in the ctd but prostate volumes did not change significantly in either group. serum levels of lh as well as total and free t at baseline and after tb injection were lower in the responders than in the nonresponders. suppression to severe oligozoospermia was less in the non-chinese men (59%) after t alone (p < 0.020); this difference disappeared with combined treatment (89%). none of the subjects in the 1-implant group exhibited oligozoospermia (sperm count, <3 million/ml). in all groups marked suppression of gonadotropins resulted in a significant decrease of spermatogenesis and azoospermia in 13/14, 11/12, and 12/14 men in groups i to iii, respectively. significant suppression of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone was achieved within 2 weeks of treatment in both groups, while testosterone concentrations were maintained in the normal physiological range. during treatment, group ii demonstrated a trend toward a greater attainment of azoospermia than groups i and iii (90% vs 62% [group i] vs 67% [group iii]; p =.09). after treatment cessation, recovery of sperm counts and gonadotropins to normal levels occurred in both groups. serum dihydrotestosterone levels were significantly (p < 0.05) decreased in the dutasteride group throughout the treatment period to a nadir of 31% baseline (wk 7). plasma lh and fsh measured by a two-site immunoassay were suppressed in a dose-dependent fashion by t and further suppressed by the addition of dmpa. there was a trend toward higher pretreatment gonadotropin levels and lower sperm counts in men who became azoospermic. high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fell by 15% in caucasian men, but was unchanged in the chinese men; both groups showed some weight gain. hemoglobin concentrations rose, and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (hdl-c) fell in both groups. there were no significant treatment-related changes in body composition, lipids, prostate-specific antigen, haematological or biochemical variables. as compared with the placebo group, more men in the active treatment groups reported adverse events such as weight gain, mood changes, acne, sweating, or libido change. dsg 150 or 300 plus t 100 suppressed spermatogenesis as effectively as lng 125-t 100 and more effectively than dsg 50-t 100 or testosterone alone.|normal young men caucasian men hormonal male contraception 30 healthy volunteers thirty men in edinburgh and 36 men in shanghai received 150 or 300 microg normal healthy male volunteers academic medical center in the united states and the research institute in china fourteen men completed 48 weeks of healthy men healthy male volunteers men participating in contraceptive trials healthy eugonadal men 17 men in the two groups fourteen subjects discontinued treatment due to adverse events normal volunteers received 100 group) enrolled in similar studies 36 normal men, aged 20-42 yr (n = 18 in each group men healthy men (n = 29 healthy men for 16-20 weeks adult men 27 men completing the suppression phase, all have recovered to sperm levels forty-three 21-45-year-old healthy men young men caucasian and chinese men men receiving male contraceptive regimens hypogonadal men twenty healthy male volunteers in each center men who became azoospermic healthy volunteers two centers with two treatment groups thirty-nine healthy male volunteers (age, 20-45 yr twenty-six healthy men another 29 subjects 27 men completed the suppression phase 16 men discontinued for various reasons twenty-four healthy young men, aged 20-49 african men two different ethnic groups one hundred and thirty subjects twenty-four healthy male volunteers (33.2 healthy chinese men sixteen normal men male contraceptive by reversibly suppressing spermatogenesis to azoospermia or severe oligoazoospermia in 95% of chinese men spermatogenesis to azoospermia in both caucasian and chinese men african as in caucasian and chinese men, with azoospermia achieved in a total of 83/98 (85%) men twenty-two men (n = 5-6/group four men in sagamu withdrew chinese men white men male hormonal contraception twenty-eight men male contraception normal men azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (<3 x 10(6)/ml) in normal men requiring contraception caucasian populations young healthy men (n = 8/group 31 healthy men (21 black) were recruited in cape town and 21 men in sagamu, nigeria sixty-two healthy chinese men fifty normal men thirty healthy men participated 51 normal men chinese and non-chinese men 354 healthy men one hundred and ten men completed 48 weeks of treatment normal volunteers all caucasian men thirty-five normal volunteers were recruited in 3 clinics and were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 doses: 1 (12 men), 2 (11 men), or 4 (12 men) ment ac implants 16 volunteers receiving the forty non-chinese and 40 chinese healthy male volunteers

than piroxicam in inducing analgesia. at 4 hours after administration, the pain relief was significantly better with tablet acetaminophen than with effervescent acetaminophen. paracetamol and rofecoxib combined improved the analgesic effect compared with rofecoxib alone for the first 1.5 h. rofecoxib alone and the combination of paracetamol and rofecoxib had a significantly better analgesic effect than paracetamol alone from 3 h onwards. however, in patients with moderate baseline pain, no differences were found between the study drugs in any of the analgesic efficacy variables. the most important finding was the statistically significantly shorter period until the onset of the action of paracetamol as against acetyl salicylic acid. ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for sum pain intensity difference (spid), for most pain intensity and pain relief measurements, 1000 mg acetaminophen was statistically superior to placebo, demonstrating assay sensitivity, and 10 and 25 mg doses of bromfenac were statistically better than both placebo and 5 mg bromfenac for ordinal and analog ratings of pain intensity and pain relief; 25 mg bromfenac produced significantly longer time to remedication than acetaminophen. propacetamol bolus resulted in a much higher incidence of local adverse events than the infusion (propacetamol bolus 90% vs propacetamol infusion 52%) with no clinically significant benefits in terms of analgesic efficacy. ibuprofen was found to be the most effective analgesic in post-episiotomy pain followed by analgin and paracetamol in that order. both doses of diflunisal were significantly more effective than acetaminophen alone and produced peak analgesia comparable to that of the acetaminophen-codeine combination. the combination was significantly superior to acetaminophen alone for all analgesic measures including spid, total, and global ratings. oral surgery pain is a reliable model to reference the effectiveness of commonly used analgesics such as ibuprofen and acetaminophen. there were few adverse effects other than sedation, which occurred twice as frequently in patients treated with nalbuphine as in those receiving acetaminophen or placebo. a positive dose-effect relationship was evident for both acetaminophen 500 mg. at 3 and 4 hours, the acetaminophen/aspirin combination as well as the aspirin/caffeine combination were significantly superior to acetaminophen alone. all four active treatments were statistically superior to placebo for sum pain intensity difference, total relief of pain, and overall evaluation parameters. the combination product was significantly (p less than 0.05) superior to either butorphanol (4 mg) or acetaminophen (650 mg) as well as placebo. the factorial analysis showed that both 1000 mg acetaminophen and 60 mg codeine made a statistically significant (p less than 0.05) contribution to the analgesic effectiveness of the combination on all measures of efficacy (sum of pain intensity differences, largest pain intensity difference, total pain relief, largest pain relief, and time to remedication). at 1 h after dosage, pain scores were significantly less (p < 0.01) after both doses of ketoprofen when compared with placebo. the 100 and 50 mg doses of ketoprofen and the combination were statistically superior to acetaminophen and placebo for many analgesic measures. ibuprofen liquigel 200 and 400 mg were also significantly more efficacious than acetaminophen 1000 mg on the summary measures totpar 6 and spid 6 (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). statistical significance was only seen for the parameter pain intensity (spid) on comparison of suprofen 100 mg + apap 650 mg versus suprofen 200 mg. flurbiprofen in 50 mg and 100 mg dosages demonstrated effective analgesic activity with the 100 mg dosage being at least as effective as the acetaminophen/codeine combination. ibuprofen 400 mg was more effective than acetaminophen 1000 mg for the sum of pain intensity difference, total pain relief, and reduction of pain by more than 50% (p less than .05), suggesting a more rapid onset of action and a more prolonged effect by ibuprofen 400 mg. codeine 60 mg was not consistently superior to placebo in this post-operative single dose analysis. the mean scores for the summary variable percent sum of the pain intensity differences (% spid) were higher in all for the combination than for acetaminophen alone, and in two studies the null hypothesis of no differences was rejected. (r)- ketoprofen possesses analgesic activity and an acceptable side-effect profile in the oral surgery pain model. ibuprofen lysine had a significantly (p < or = 0.05) faster onset of action with greater peak and overall analgesic effect than did effect than did acetaminophen. in addition, both ibuprofen and ketoprofen showed statistical superiority over acetaminophen at earlier time points on the time-effect curves for pain relief and pain intensity difference. time to remedication, a measure of duration of analgesic effect, was significantly longer (p < 0.001) with naproxen sodium (median, 9.9 hours) than with either acetaminophen (median, 3.1 hours) or placebo (median, 2.0 hours). analgesia was similar for ketorolac 10 and 20 mg and ibuprofen 400 mg; however, these treatments were superior to acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination. statistical analyses indicated better analgesic efficacy in both pid and spid scores for the orphenadrine-acetaminophen combination over the three other treatments. acetaminophen alone and the acetaminophen-codeine combination were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of analgesia, and their effects were significant for 4 and 5 hours respectively. both nalbuphine and acetaminophen were significantly superior to placebo for most measures of total and peak analgesia. statistically significant pain relief (mean pain intensity differences and sum of pain intensity differences) was seen in the group receiving paracetamol compared to those receiving placebo or tiaramide from 1 h to 6 h after drug ingestion. both doses of flurbiprofen resulted in significant analgesia in comparison with placebo, acetaminophen, and acetaminophen plus codeine as measured by pain intensity difference, pain relief, and global evaluation. although efficacy was lower for the acetaminophen-phenyltoloxamine combination than for acetaminophen alone, for every variable, the contrast for interaction was not statistically significant. acetaminophen was significantly better than aspirin with respect to the maximum difference in the intensity of pain (p less than 0.05) and the maximum pain relief achieved (p less than 0.03) and according to the global evaluation (p less than 0.02). there were no significant differences between treatment groups with respect to the number of patients requiring rescue medication, however the time to dosing was significantly longer for those taking soluble aspirin when compared with placebo (hazard ratio 2.34, 95% ci 1.41 to 3.88, p<0.001). overall, the combination was slightly better than acetaminophen alone. pain relief after the initial dose of diclofenac-k (2 x 12.5 mg) was superior to placebo (p < .01 for all efficacy outcomes) and comparable to paracetamol (2 x 500 mg). flurbiprofen was significantly superior to the acetaminophen codeine combination with respect to the number of hours until remedication. for many efficacy variables, all active treatments were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.05) more effective than placebo.|148 outpatients with pain after oral surgery 184 patients who had undergone dental impaction surgery rated

family smoking levels of brand-specific advertising exposure adolescent smoking onset and progression|the most important predictor of smoking for boys, having a best friend who smoked, was significant on application of the chi 2 test (p 0.037), although it was non-significant when included singly in a logistic regression model (0.094); the discrepancy was probably due to the small number of best friends known to smoke. for boys, the proportion with a favorite ad was stable across all 5 surveys, as it was for girls across the first 4 surveys. the older cohort showed significant differences in knowledge which were dependent upon smoking category, with 1980 smokers having lower knowledge scores than non-smokers and showing an apparent decrement in their previous knowledge. adolescents who, at baseline, owned a tobacco promotional item and named a brand whose advertisements attracted their attention were more than twice as likely to become established smokers (odds ratio = 2.70) than adolescents who did neither. cigarette advertising appears to increase children's awareness of smoking at a generic level and encourages them to take up the behaviour, beginning with any cigarettes which are available and affordable. two longitudinal cohorts of adolescents drawn from the 1993 and 1996 versions of the california tobacco surveys were followed 3 and 6 years later. no significant interaction effects between pro- and anti-tobacco media exposure on smoking susceptibility were found. exposure to tobacco-related advertising was a risk factor for white (susceptibility and ever smoking) and african american (susceptibility only) adolescents but not for hispanic adolescents. adjusting for multiple risk factors, the odds of initiation remained significantly higher (odds ratio: 1.64 [95% confidence interval: 1.06-2.55]) for adolescents who reported moderate visit frequency (0.5-1.9 visits per week), and the odds of initiation more than doubled for those who visited > or = 2 times per week (odds ratio: 2.58 [95% confidence interval: 1.68-3.97]). among the cohort, baseline brand-specific exposure to cigarette advertising in magazines was highly correlated with brand of initiation among new smokers (r = 0.93, p = 0.0001), brand smoked by current smokers (r = 0.86, p = 0.0004), and brand whose advertisements attracted attention the most (r = 0.87, p = 0.0002). among experimental smokers, the majority (64%) were receptive to tobacco marketing, which had a multivariate association with higher level of lifetime smoking (movie smoking did not). compared with low exposure to cigarette advertisements, high exposure remained a significant predictor of adolescent smoking initiation after controlling for baseline covariates (adjusted relative risk: 1.46 [95% confidence interval: 1.08-1.97]; p < .05). in girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% cl, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% cl, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years. for each 1-sd increase in novelty seeking, the odds of being more receptive to tobacco advertising increased by 12% (ie, being in a specific category or higher), which in turn resulted in an 11% increase in the odds of smoking progression from 9th grade to 12th grade. this study supports a close linkage between tobacco promotional activities and uptake of smoking among adolescents beyond baseline descriptions of receptivity to cigarette promotions. among non-smokers, the strongest predictors to emerge are intention to smoke, the belief that smoking is fun, peers, siblings and mother consumption, and being male; however girls appear to consolidate the consumption more than boys among the cohort of triers. less than 5% (n=92) at baseline possessed a promotional item but a further 10%(n=172) were willing to use an item. among time 1 ever smokers, both tobacco marketing receptivity and exposure to movie smoking predicted higher levels of time 2 smoking [2.17 (1.78, 2.63) and 1.62 (1.18, 2.23), respectively], and the two estimates were not significantly different. the more advertisements identified at baseline, the greater was the risk of being a smoker (p<0.0001).|3,664 spanish children aged 13 and 14 years filled in

whereas only 19 per cent of patients given p.i.e. alone or in combination with gentamicin because bacteremic, and 9.5 per cent had postbiopsy bacteriuria. there was no significant difference among the three groups in noninfective complications but the incidence of infective complications in group a was significantly higher than in groups b and c (p < 0.01). both of these antibiotic regimens produced a statistically significant reduction in urinary infection (p<0.02, p<0.05). there was no significant difference among the three groups in noninfective complications (27, 29 and 31 in groups 1-3, respectively) but the incidence of infective complications (19, six and eight, respectively) was significantly higher in group 1 (p = 0.003). in a multivariate analysis, patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with a history of prostatitis had higher microbiological and clinical failure rates, respectively, than those without such conditions. there was no statistically significant difference in the rate of positive msus between the groups. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not reduce the frequency of fever or bacteremia but did produce a significant reduction in bacteriuria (0 versus 21%, p equals 0.008). there was no significant difference between the two antibiotic prophylaxis regimen (one single dose or three days) for patients undergoing trus guided biopsies. urinary tract infection rates were greater in the netilmycin-metronidazole group: 17% (8 of 47 patients) versus 2% (1 of 54) in the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group, p = 0.01. this prospective study showed that short-term prophylaxis with p/t was associated with a low rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria, requiring no further treatment, whereas although the rate was similar on long-term prophylaxis with ciprofloxacin patients required further treatment, with one needing hospitalization. when parenteral piperacillin alone in group b (n = 22) was administered, the rates of the same complications were 9 and 14%, respectively, while both rates were as low as 4% in group c (n = 25) when piperacillin in combination with povidone-iodine enema was given. microbiological success (no bacteriuria > 10(5) organisms/ml, or bacteraemia, after tpb) was observed in 98 of 103 men (95%), of whom 48 received pt and 50 cefuroxime. single-dose oral ciprofloxacin reduced bacteriuria after biopsy compared with placebo in patients undergoing transrectal prostatic biopsy and provided an economic advantage. though there was no statistical significant difference in the rates of bacteriuria following administration of trimethoprim and gentamicin, data appear to favour trimethoprim prophylaxis. efficiency control was determined by the incidence of urinary tract infection (uti) and complications in both groups after statistical analysis. overall, only seven patients (1.8% of the cases) had positive urine cultures with no difference between these three groups. of 23 patients who received the study drug 2 (8.6 per cent) had positive urine cultures at 48 hours compared to 9 of 25 (36 per cent) from the placebo group.|prostate biopsy patients with diabetes mellitus and patients with a history of prostatitis patients who required trnbp 117 patients enrolled in the study 101 were evaluated and of these patients 47 received patients having transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate patients with symptomatic urinary tract infections (utis), prostatitis, indwelling catheters, diabetes and those receiving steroid therapy were excluded 497 patients enrolled, 247 were randomized to patients undergoing transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate after transrectal biopsy of the prostate 115 patients were available for final analysis 138 evaluable patients, 72 received parenteral p/t and 66 oral transrectal prostate biopsy in 110 men 140 patients submitted to prostate biopsy with transrectal ultrasonographic control after transrectal prostatic biopsy (tpb patients undergoing transrectal biopsies of the prostate gland transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsies patients scheduled for tpb men undergoing transrectal needle biopsy of the prostate (trnbp 63 patients between june 1996 and september 1998, 231 patients who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria entered the study;

recovery, relapse, and growth rates of hiv-positive|family planning-hiv integration using the referral model improved family planning service utilization by clients accessing hiv services, but further improvement is possible. clients interviewed after the introduction of family planning services received significantly more family planning counselling and accepted significantly more contraceptives than those clients served before the intervention. documented rpr screening was improved after implementation of pmtct research and service were operating simultaneously and not with research or service alone. hiv transmission between discordant couples was 0 infections/100 follow-up years (95% ci, 0-3.2); vertical transmission from mother to child was 11 infections/100 live births (95% ci, 4.6-21.9); these rates are significantly lower than expected rates of transmission in haiti. access to and information about hormonal contraceptives resulted in increased use and reduced attrition among both hiv-positive and hiv-negative women in this study. after changes to service delivery, time-to-treatment initiation was reduced from a median of 56 days to 37 days (p = 0.041). in the maternity ward, quality of obstetrical care at admission, delivery and post-partum care globally improved in all facilities after the implementation of the programme although some indicators remained poor, such as filling in the partograph directly during labour. a multipronged family planning intervention can lead to high nonbarrier contraceptive uptake and reduced pregnancy incidence among women in hiv-1-serodiscordant partnerships. community-based reproductive health agents (cbrhas) can increase community knowledge of and offer immediate access to reproductive health services, including hiv/aids. the average staff workload was found to be 50.5% (8-147%) for facilities providing pmtct of hiv infection and 37.8% (11-82%) for facilities without pmtct services. main outcome indicators were the proportion of treatment-eligible pregnant women enrolling into hiv care within 60 days of hiv diagnosis, and of these, the proportion initiating art during pregnancy. between 6 and 24 months post-partum, proportions of women using modern contraception varied from 52 to 65% among hiv-positive women, and from 65 to 75% among hiv-negative women. the hiv prevalence rate was 19% among single women aged 20-24 years and 25% among single women aged 25-45 years. men attending facilities with higher client loads were 88% less likely to receive family planning information and 93% less likely to receive contraceptives than those attending facilities with lower client loads. overall uptake of hiv testing was 60.7% for parents and 94% for children. provider-initiated testing and counselling is feasible and acceptable in family planning services, does not adversely affect the quality of the family planning consultation and increases access to and use of hiv testing in a population who would benefit from knowing their status. observational data demonstrated that providers who participated in the training intervention delivered pmtct counseling of a consistently higher quality than did providers who did not undergo training. contraceptive use increased from 38% before hiv testing to 52% 1 week later (p < 0.0001) and then decreased to 46% by 12 months. we completed an audit cycle, and showed that all aspects of our care had improved since the introduction of this integrated service. women were as likely as men to achieve high attendance rates before the interventions, but more likely to do so at both 6 months and 1 year postintervention (after adjustment for the other variables).|clients attended eight public vct facilities in the oromia region, ethiopia 164 pregnant women

low-density lipoprotein oxidation restriction of activity|all three basic interventions resulted in statistically significant increases in the rates of regression: relative risks were 4.8 (95% confidence interval [ci] = 1.6-14.2) for anti-h. pylori treatment, 5 compared with placebo, vitamin e had no effect on the incidence of major cardiovascular events (both active and placebo vitamin e groups, 10.9 events per 1000 person-years; hazard ratio [hr], 1.01 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 0.90-1.13]; p = .86), as well as total myocardial infarction (hr, 0.90 [95% ci, 0.75-1.07]; p = .22), total stroke (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.89-1.29]; p = .45), and cardiovascular mortality (hr, 1.07 [95% ci, 0.90-1.28]; p = .43). there was no difference in the standardized mortality ratios across gender or age group. antibody titers after influenza vaccine were higher in groups that received trace elements alone or associated with vitamins, whereas the vitamin group had significantly lower antibody titers (p<.05). the difference in the change of pgi/ii ratio between baseline and after 5-year follow up was statistically significant between the intervention groups among those who completed the supplementation: - 0.25 for the low-dose group and - 0.13 for the high-dose group (p = 0.046). for nuclear cataract, the corresponding rates were 12.9% and 12.1% (p = 0.77). subjects without dementia had a greater rate of infections than those with dementia (or=1.44, 95% ci=1.19-1.76). after 6 months of supplementation, a significant increase in vitamin and trace element serum levels was obtained in the corresponding treatment groups: a plateau was then observed for the whole study. plasma malondialdehyde decreased by 35% in both groups (p = 0.002) but not when adjusted for lipids. a micronutrient supplement providing the reference nutrient intake administered over 8 weeks had no beneficial effect on antibody response to influenza vaccine in older people living in long-term care. supplementation did not significantly affect contacts with primary care and days of infection per person (incidence rate ratio 0.96, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 1.19 and 1.07, 0.90 to 1.27). however, group two (antioxidant) also had increased cortical opacification of the right lens (p = 0.04), compared to group one (placebo). the mean levels of ldl and hdl cholesterol were unaltered in the antioxidant group and the placebo group; these levels changed substantially (by -42 percent and +26 percent, respectively) in the simvastatin-niacin group. in groups 1 l and 2 l/a, mean eye macular pigment optical density increased approximately 0.09 log units from baseline, snellen equivalent visual acuity improved 5.4 letters for group 1 l and 3.5 letters for group 2 l/a, and contrast sensitivity improved. no late effect of antioxidant supplementation was revealed 5 years after ending the intervention neither on ischemic cardiovascular disease incidence and mortality in both genders nor on cancer incidence in women. there was no statistically significant difference in progression rate (rate ratio = 0.92, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 0.74 to 1.15) or regression rate (rate ratio = 1.09, 95% ci = 0.90 to 1.33) between vitamin and placebo groups. among treated women, b(a)p-dna adducts decreased by 31% compared with women on placebo (p = 0.03). despite random assignment, the baseline score on the mini-mental state examination was higher in the placebo group than in the other three groups, and this variable was highly predictive of the primary outcome (p<0.001). after 3 months treatment, analysis of oxidative stress markers showed an increase in glutathione peroxidase activity in plasma (p = 0.0389) and a decrease in plasma levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (p = 0.0055) in the group of patients given alpha-tocopherol in combination with riluzole. neither the primary nor the secondary outcome measures could determine whether a megadose of vitamin e is efficacious in slowing disease progression in als as an add-on therapy to riluzol. smokers with gstm1-0 genotype had a tendency to higher baseline cca-imt values than those with gstm1-1 (0.97 versus 0.92 mm, p=0.09). six-minute walk test and inflammatory cytokine levels remained unchanged in both groups. no substantial short-term beneficial effect on incidence or mortality for this type of cancer occurred following daily supplementation with multiple vitamins and minerals among adults with precancerous lesions of the esophagus. neither treatment appeared to be effective in any subgroup of patients or in the prevention of any subtype of polyp defined by size or location. smoothed relative risk curves for lung cancer incidence and all-cause mortality indicated that relative risks remained above 1.0 throughout the post-intervention follow-up. in men, this treatment effect was 37% (95 ci, 4 to 69, p=0.028). four hundred forty-eight participants completed the poms-bi questionnaires at both time points, with no significant differences in total mood or mood-subscale scores seen between doses. oral supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin e levels in the experimental group. after treatment, plasma ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) increased only in the vitamin-treated group, associated with a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in plasma mda. small improvements in fisk scores were recorded during placebo therapy (median improvement, 4; p = 0.03). long-term vitamin or garlic supplementation had no beneficial effects on the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions or on gastric cancer incidence. vitamin e had no significant effect on incidence or number of days with infection for all, upper, or lower respiratory tract infections. there was a greater increase in the mv vs p group for serum 25(oh)d dietary levels of antioxidants (vitamin c, beta carotene, retinol equivalents) had no effect on cartilage volume loss. alpha-tocopherol treatment significantly reduced the risk of the primary trial endpoint of cardiovascular death and non-fatal mi (41 vs 64 events; relative risk 0.53 number of symptoms, 6 (3-8) vs 4 (3-8), p =.03; presence of fever, 36.7% vs 25.2%, p =.009; and restriction of activity, 52.3% vs 41.1%, p =.02. aspirin lowered the frequency of all the endpoints, being significant for cardiovascular death (from 1.4 to 0.8%; relative risk 0.56 [95% ci 0.31-0.99]) and total cardiovascular events (from 8.2 to 6.3%; 0.77 [0.62-0.95]). for cardiovascular death, there was a significant 24% reduction (rr, 0.76; 95% ci, 0.59-0.98; p = .03). funding surgery worldwide for age-related cataract (arc), a leading cause of blindness, is a huge economic burden. for prostate cancer incidence (n = 672), the rr was 0.88 (95% ci, 0.76-1.03) for participants receiving alpha-tocopherol compared with nonrecipients. following vitamin supplementation, cell-mediated immune function improved as indicated by a significant increase in the absolute number of t cells (p less than 0.05), t4 subsets (p less than 0.05), t4 to t8 ratio (p less than 0.01) and the proliferation of lymphocytes in response to phytohaemagglutinin (p less than 0.01). at the first evaluation of events, 18 months after initiating the study, the primary outcome was significantly reduced in individuals receiving vitamin e (2.2%) compared with placebo (4.7%; p=0.01) and led to early termination of the study. cell-mediated immune function assessed by the number of t cells and subsets remained constant in the supplemented group and there was a significant increase in cd57 natural killer cells. there was no interaction between the 2 treatment interventions. no statistically significant differences between the two treatment studied. oxidative stress is greater in haemodialysis patients with prevalent cardiovascular disease than in those without, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in excess cardiovascular disease in haemodialysis. patients in the vitamin e group had a higher risk of heart failure (rr, 1.13; 95% ci, 1.01-1.26; p = .03) and hospitalization for heart failure (rr, 1.21; 95% ci, 1.00-1.47; p = .045). there were no significant differences in the rate of progression to alzheimer's disease between the vitamin e and placebo groups at any point, either among all patients or among apolipoprotein e epsilon4 carriers. significantly (p = .03) lower total mortality (relative risk [rr] = 0.91 vitamin e supplementation is ineffective in reducing the progression of carotid atherosclerosis as measured by intima-media thickness in chronic smokers. the mean serum total tocopherol (toc) concentration in the 100-mg group was significantly higher than that in the 3-mg group 6 months after the start of the study, and this raised value was maintained throughout the study; the level in the 3-mg group did not change significantly from the baseline value. there was also no significant difference between treated and control groups in the mean number of new nonmelanoma skin cancers per patient-year. treatment with n-3 pufa, but not vitamin e, significantly lowered the risk of the primary endpoint (relative-risk decrease 10% [95% ci 1-18] by two-way analysis, 15% [2-26] by four-way analysis). gastric juice ascorbic acid and total vitamin c levels were raised significantly in the supplemented group (p=0.01) but supplementation had no effect on the mucosal level of this vitamin. at the 1-year follow-up, we observed a trend for lower mortality (p = 0.060) in subgroups treated with n-3 fatty acids, but without significant differences in rehabilitation result status among groups. there were statistically nonsignificant increased risks of prostate cancer in the vitamin e group (p = .06) and type 2 diabetes mellitus in the selenium group (relative risk, 1.07; 99% ci, 0.94-1.22; p = .16) but not in the selenium + vitamin e group. comparing retinol-supplemented subjects with placebo-supplemented subjects showed a hazard ratio for first new scc of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.56-0.99; p = 0.04). there were 377 new cases of basal cell skin cancer among patients in the selenium group and 350 cases among the control group (relative risk [rr], 1.10; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.95-1.28), and 218 new squamous cell skin cancers in the selenium group and 190 cases among the controls (rr, 1.14; 95% ci, 0.93-1.39). in terms of the number of tumours, there was no effect on incidence of basal-cell carcinoma by sunscreen use or by betacarotene but the incidence of squamous-cell carcinoma was significantly lower in the sunscreen group than in the no daily sunscreen group (1115 vs 1832 per 100,000; 0.61 [0.46-0.81]). the infection rates in the vitamin a and placebo groups were 4.7 and 4.3 per 1,000 days of follow-up, respectively (relative risk 1.1; 95% ci 0.6, 2.0). ratings of perceived claudication pain were significantly less after the polestriding training program (p= 0.02). there were no significant interactions between agents for the primary end point, but those randomized to both active ascorbic acid and vitamin e experienced fewer strokes (p value for interaction, .03). all four measures of dna damage decreased in both groups; the between-group differences were not statistically significant. two hundred patients believed to be free of polyps after removal of at least one colorectal polyp were randomized to receive a supplement of 400 mg each of ascorbic acid and alpha-tocopherol, or a placebo. mean absolute healing rates were 0.21 and 0.27 cm2/week in the intervention and control group, respectively (pi of the adjusted difference: -0.17 to 0.13). there were also no significant differences in the number of cases of lung cancer (82 in the beta carotene group vs. 88 in the placebo group); the number of deaths from cancer (386 vs. 380), deaths from any cause (979 vs. 968), or deaths from cardiovascular disease (338 vs. 313); the number of men with myocardial infarction (468 vs. 489); the number with stroke (367 vs. 382); or the number with any one of the previous three end points (967 vs. 972). patients treated with alpha-tocopherol tended to live longer without development of hcc but the difference was not statistically significant. as regards markers of hepatic fibrogenesis, vitamin e treatment decreased serum hyaluronic acid (p<0.05) while serum aminoterminal peptide of type iii procollagen did not change in either group. there were no significant differences in mental test score, barthel score, or length of stay between the two groups. celecoxib status did not influence changes in dysplasia grade overall (p = .78) or by baseline histology subgroup. compared with placebo, alpha-tocopherol supplementation significantly raised plasma vitamin e levels (p<0.0001), reduced circulating oxidized ldl (p=0.03), and reduced ldl oxidative susceptibility (p<0.01).|patients with coronary disease: cambridge heart antioxidant study (chaos patients with mild to moderate alcoholic hepatitis in a double blind poststroke

enhanced services group achieved higher overall proportions of opiate negative urine toxicology tests (87% vs. 69%, p=0.04) and longer periods of consecutive abstinence from opiates (10.3 weeks vs. 7.8 weeks, p=0.154). all three treatment groups showed significant improvement, but patients receiving the additional psychotherapies showed improvement in more areas and to a greater degree than those who received counseling alone, and with less use of medication. post-treatment, hrg patients scored higher on a sexual risk quiz and reported increased self-efficacy in high risk sexual situations. the three treatments had similar efficacies with respect to the mean percentage of opioid-negative urine specimens (standard medical management and once-weekly medication dispensing, 44 percent; standard medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; and enhanced medical management and thrice-weekly medication dispensing, 40 percent; p=0.82) and the maximum number of consecutive weeks during which patients were abstinent from illicit opioids. one month after the extra therapy ended both groups had made significant gains, but there were no significant differences between groups. the combined cra groups did significantly better than the standard group in the following areas: consecutive opiate-negative urinalysis (3 weeks), and the 6-month asi drug composite score. the experimental intervention increased attendance in subjects with low and high levels of psychopathy and with and without other psychiatric comorbidity. the therapist-delivered and computer-assisted cra plus vouchers interventions produced comparable weeks of continuous opioid and cocaine abstinence (m = 7.98 and 7.78, respectively) and significantly greater weeks of abstinence than the standard intervention (m = 4.69; p < .05), yet participants in the computer-assisted cra condition had over 80% of their intervention delivered by an interactive computer program. a clinical trial was used to evaluate short-term interpersonal psychotherapy (ipt) as treatment for psychiatric disorders in opiate addicts who were also participating in a full-service methadone hydrochloride maintenance program. compared to participants receiving standard treatment, participants randomly assigned to the free plus guide mapping condition had significantly lower opiate use based on urinalysis and self-report data. at the end of the 6-month treatment period, rpmg mothers showed marginally significant improvement on child maltreatment (self-reported) and cocaine abuse based on urinalyses when compared with rt mothers; notably, children of rpmg mothers reported significantly greater improvement in emotional adjustment and depression than children of rt mothers. overall opioid use was least in the hc and hy groups; opioid use decreased most rapidly over time in the hc group relative to the hy, lc and ly groups. both abstinence-reinforcement interventions increased cocaine abstinence, but the addition of the voucher intervention resulted in the largest and most sustained abstinence. contingent vouchers and a methadone dose increase each significantly increased the percentage of opiate-negative urine specimens during intervention. however, there were no significant differences for competitive employment or total earnings. urinalysis results indicate that the tp intervention was significantly more effective in reducing illicit drug use than either the ua or std interventions. the msc vs. ssc condition was associated with a higher rate of counseling attendance (83% vs. 44%, p < .001) and a lower rate of poor treatment response (46% vs. 79%, p < .001). a controlled trial was conducted evaluating cognitive-behavioural group psychotherapy as a measure to reduce concomitant drug use in methadone maintenance treatment (mmt). vc resulted in better 12-week retention (85%) compared to mc (58%;

greater in depressed patients, but relief was also observed in patients who did not show an antidepressant effect. more patients completing all three treatments preferred opioids (54%) than tca (30%; p = 0.02). the results showed the superiority of dothiepin over placebo in achieving pain relief; 71% of patients were pain free in the dothiepin group at nine weeks compared with 47% in the placebo group. we found no difference with regard to relief of steady, brief, or skin pain by visual analog scales for pain and pain relief; mood; disability; satisfaction; or preference between the two drugs. we found good to excellent pain relief in 16 of 24 patients (p less than or equal to 0.001). the average daily pain intensity as reported in the diary (primary outcome) was not significantly reduced by venlafaxine compared with placebo. overall pain was significantly reduced by doxepin, capsaicin and doxepin/capsaicin to a similar extent. gabapentin produced greater pain reductions than amitriptyline (mean final scores were 1.9 vs. 1.3 points below baseline scores; p = 0.026). subjective reports indicated a greater reduction in pain at 2 and 4 weeks on amitriptyline, but no difference at 6 weeks. there was no significant difference in pain intensity reduction between the maximum tolerated dose of venlafaxine (75 mg in most cases) and the placebo. the results after three months of treatment showed that clomipramine: (1) was better than amitriptyline in treating trigeminal neuralgia; (2) tended to be better in the treatment of tension headache; and (3) amitriptyline is better in treating postherpatic neuralgia. citalopram significantly relieved the symptoms of neuropathy as measured by both observer- and self-rating in comparison with placebo. side effects were troublesome with both agents. despite some adverse effects, especially of an anticholinergic nature, the patients generally preferred imipramine to placebo. the placebo group showed a pain rate of 21% within 1 year after the diagnosis of thalamic stroke compared with 17% in the group under prophylactic treatment with amitriptyline. for both the acupuncture and amitriptyline comparisons, changes in pain score were not significantly different between the 2 groups. no significant differences were found between the groups in pain intensity or pain-related disability post-treatment, in either intent-to-treat analyses or analyses of study completers. greater relief was associated with higher amitriptyline doses, up to the maximum dose of 150 mg/d, and with higher serum tricyclic levels. (1) gabapentin-treated patients showed statistically significant improvement in pain reduction as well as improvement in quality of life and mood disturbance when compared with placebo-treated patients; the plasma levels of imipramine and its metabolite desipramine were significantly higher in patients who benefited from imipramine treatment. a statistically significant decrease was seen in pain in groups 1 and 2, and no significant changes were seen in groups 3 and 4. nineteen patients completed both treatments; 12 reported at least moderate relief with desipramine and two reported relief with placebo. it seems possible that clomipramine activates serotonin-containing neurons of the endorphin-mediated analgesia system that control pain transmission in the cns. there was a significant decrease in the incidence of chest wall pain (55% vs. 19%, p = 0.0002), arm pain (45% vs. 17%, p = 0.003), and axilla pain (51% vs. 19%, p = 0.0009) between the control group and the venlafaxine group, respectively. the mianserin plus desmethylmianserin plasma concentration ranged from 85 to 850 nmol.l-1, with the highest concentration in a patient who was a poor metabolizer of both sparteine and mephenytoin. neither amitriptyline nor mexiletine provide significant pain relief in patients with hiv-associated painful sensory neuropathy. results showed that early treatment with low-dose amitriptyline reduced pain prevalence by more than one-half (p < 0.05; odds ratio, 2.9:1) five of the 14 patients treated with carbamazepine reported some pain relief, but the effect did not reach statistical significance when compared to placebo. by the end of the study, the interference with daily activities by pain had diminished significantly (p = .001) in both groups, including improvements in sleeping and walking. amitriptyline reduced the depression scores in the depressed group but had no effect on the depression scores in the non-depressed group. the results clearly indicate the better analgesic effect of tricyclic antidepressants over placebo (p less than 0.0001). distigmine alone also decreased pain and increased saliva flow, sometimes to the point of discomfort, whereas amitriptyline alone, in this particular series, did not significantly reduce pain and produced unpleasant mouth dryness. amitriptyline was slightly better than maprotiline (p < .05) [tested by repeated measures analysis of variance (anova)]. the intensity and overall quality of pain deteriorated at day 14 in the fluvoxamine group and improved in those treated with fluoxetine. significant relief of both pain and paresthesia was obtained with this combination. all 3 treatment regimens resulted in a significant improvement from baseline in burning mouth symptoms at week 8 as demonstrated by the quantitative (mean reduction in vas, ham-d, and ham-a scores) and qualitative (percentage of responders) analyses. side effects experienced with bupropion sr were not dose-limiting and consisted primarily of dry mouth, insomnia, headache, gastrointestinal upset, tremor, constipation, and dizziness. none of the individual pain ratings were significantly changed by st. john's wort as compared to placebo (p=0.09--0.33). the sum of the individual pain scores during treatment week 4 was lower on venlafaxine (80% of baseline score;

p < 0.001). neither paroxetine nor imipramine caused changes in objective measures of peripheral nerve function. the incidence of adverse events for all patients was similar in both groups (tramadol 76.5%; clomipramine with or without levomepromazine 83.3%). the therapeutic analgesic efficacy of the two drugs proved to be similar. there were no substantial differences between the two treatments in spitzer's quality of life score and for each item. no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in outcome variables when controlling for initial pain scores. the areas of allodynia and pin-prick hyperalgesia decreased significantly in venlafaxine groups compared to the placebo. treatment with imipramine hydrochloride or amitriptyline hydrochloride resulted in complete remission of lower extremity pains in all patients in 10 +/-|neuropathic pain patients 49 patients with phn chronic pain 26 postherpetic neuralgia patients 6 weeks of treatment with patients with postherpetic neuralgia patients with severe, distal, symmetrical, predominantly sensitive diabetic polyneuropathy (dpn thirty-five patients twenty-five type-ii diabetic patients with pain attributed to diabetic neuropathy and a minimum score of 2 on a pain intensity scale ranging from 0 (no pain) to 4 (excruciating pain breast cancer postherpetic neuralgia 39 patients in a placebo-controlled, long-term study 82 patients with chronic pain resulting from mononeuropathy were treated with painful polyneuropathy in diabetics and nondiabetics central pain all 25 patients completed the trial patients with painful mono- and polyneuropathies fifty-seven patients severe pain forty subjects (20 with fluoxetine and 20 with 244 adult outpatients with metabolically stable type 1 or 2 diabetes with painful diabetic neuropathy two patients had mixed elements of neurogenic and musculoskeletal pain burning mouth syndrome 15 patients with central post-stroke pain (cpsp) but without signs of depression diabetic and nondiabetic patients forty-five patients were admitted to the study: 27 with oncological peripheral nerve lesions, 6 with post herpetic neuralgias, 10 with not oncological nerve lesions, 2 with central nervous lesions chronic human neuropathic pain burning mouth pain 28 patients with chronic oral-facial pain painful polyneuropathy forty patients were assigned to one of the treatment sequences, and 29 completed all three study periods 10 to 20 percent of people with from herpes zoster (shingles twenty patients completed the trial patients with painful diabetic neuropathy, comparing patients with acute thalamic stroke in preventing central poststroke pain groups of patients of either sex, with pain indication of trigeminal neuralgia, tension headache or postherpatic neuralgia, received doses of seventy-six patients with phn patients who did not improve on gabapentin monotherapy and then received fifty-three depressed patients persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv 55 patients completed the study 10 us cities neuropathic pain 23 patients were treated with chronic cancer pain with deafferentation component patients with bms thirty-seven patients with diabetic and nondiabetic painful polyneuropathy elderly patients with acute herpes zoster nineteen patients completed the study persons with sci. eighty-four participants with sci and chronic pain 18 patients in a double-blind, cross-over study with postmastectomy pain syndrome (pmps thirteen patients were analysed patients with painful diabetic polyneuropathy 60 patients with neuropathic pain for 8 weeks a group of patients referred to a multidisciplinary pain clinic for the management of chronic intractable pain for which no substantial organic cause could be demonstrated 15 patients could be included in the statistical analysis persons with sci twelve patients with severe, painful diabetic neuropathy in the lower extremities dysesthetic pain in traumatic myelopathy pain in diabetic neuropathy patients with stable glycemic control and neuropathic pain 145 patients assigned equally to sixty-five patients attending a pain relief clinic fifty patients completed two periods, and 44 patients completed all three thirty-nine patients (23 women and 16 men;

improvements in strength persisted during 3-months follow-up while other strength variables and functional performances were lost after cessation of training. no difference between the two groups was demonstrated in the duration of physical rehabilitation by a per protocol analysis of the patients who completed the trial. there were significantly better results for the patients receiving treatment by active electrical stimulation (repeated measures analysis of variance, p < 0.001). the clinical results in the cases who had received intensive physical therapy and those given routine physical therapy did not differ during the postoperative follow-up period of 9 weeks. however, a significant increase in within-group variance from admission to discharge (p less than .01) was noted, and this led to the analysis of a subgroup containing six pairs of subjects matched for number of predictors of poor outcome.(abstract truncated at 250 words) there were also additional functional benefits for the weight-bearing group--improved ability to complete a lateral step-up on the affected leg with nil or one hand supports (or 3.4, 95% ci 1.1 to 12.3) and the need for less supportive walking aids (p = 0.045). within the intervention group, improvements in quadriceps strength were significantly associated with improved performances in the weight-bearing test measures and with increased walking velocity. patients in the ea group were more likely to be discharged directly home from the acute care than those in the da group (26.3 compared with 2.4%) and less likely to need high-level care (36.8 compared with 56%). those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (p= 0.029). a statistically significant difference in the overall trajectory of time in exercise was seen (p<.001), with more time spent exercising in all three treatment groups. there was no significant difference in change in leg extensor power, or any other outcome measure, in the es group compared to usual care controls. however, people with hip fracture and cognitive impairment gained greater benefit from the higher dose programme than from the lower dose programme. at the 4-month retest, there were differences between the groups in the extent of improvement since the initial assessment for balance (f(10,196)=2.82, p<.001) and functional performance (f(6,200)=3.57, p<.001), but not for strength (f(12,190)=1.09, p=.37) or gait (f(8,200)=.39, p=.92). isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the

95% ci, 5.27 to 16.42; p < .001) and less frequent douching (mean difference, -0.76; 95% ci, -1.15 to -0.37; p = .001). the increase in the percentage of sexual acts protected by female condoms from baseline to the 6-month follow-up was greater for the experimental group. according to intent-to-treat analyses, women assigned to the hiv-prevention group intervention were significantly less likely to have repeat pregnancy at 6 months postpartum than individual-care and attention-matched controls; they demonstrated increased condom use and decreased unprotected sexual intercourse compared with individual-care and attention-matched controls. these results provide partial support for the hypothesis that an imb model-based intervention leads to reductions in sexual risk behavior and suggest directions for future research. multivariable logistic regression analysis controlling for condom use at enrollment demonstrated that the experimental intervention (odds ratio = 2.8; p = 0.03) and the higher cognitive complexity (odds ratio = 4.6; p = 0.02) independently contributed to greater condom use at follow-up. significantly more intervention women carried condoms, discussed condoms with partners, and had higher self-efficacy to use condoms with primary partners. we found no differences between neighborhoods with and without the power campaign with regard to our primary outcomes. the treatment group demonstrated statistically significant improvements in aids knowledge and intentions to use condoms, and fewer sex partners at the six-month follow-up as compared to the control group. at 1 month, compared with control participants, intervention participants had increased sexual risk knowledge and more positive attitudes toward condoms and tended to use condoms more with a nonmain partner. the results revealed that over a 6-month period, compared to girls in the health promotion intervention, the girls in the hiv risk-reduction interventions had significant higher scores on hiv transmission knowledge, condom attitudes, and self-efficacy to use condoms. the computer-based transtheoretical model-tailored intervention resulted in a 70% increase in reported dual-method contraceptive use in a group of women at high risk for stis and unintended pregnancy. data obtained at a 3-month follow-up assessment showed that girls who received the hiv-related intervention improved their hiv-related knowledge and enhanced their motivation for risk reduction compared to girls who received a control (health promotion) intervention. a risk-reduction intervention consisting of three small-group sessions significantly decreased the rates of chlamydial and gonorrheal infection among mexican-american and african-american women at high risk for sexually transmitted disease. the condom promotion intervention led to increased self-reported condom use up to 6 months following intervention as well as positive changes in perceived benefits of condom use, affective attitudes toward condom use and condom users, perceived acceptance of sexuality, control over the sexual encounter, perceived self-efficacy for condom use, and intentions to use condoms. self-reports revealed that those assigned to the interactive video were significantly more likely to be abstinent in the first 3 months following initial exposure to the intervention, and experienced fewer condom failures in the following 3 months, compared to controls. to evaluate the efficacy of an intervention to reduce sexual risk behaviors, sexually transmitted diseases (stds), and pregnancy and enhance mediators of hiv-preventive behaviors. this randomized controlled trial indicates that cognitive-behavioral interventions are effective for reducing behavioral risk and preventing stis and ups in young, sexually active women who are not seeking health care.|2 prenatal clinics high-risk female adolescents 62 sexually-active, single girls 3,003 women in all 12 study neighborhoods on condom knowledge, attitudes, use and awareness of power materials 409 women, recruited from family planning clinics in northern california all female marine recruits (n=2,288) in training were approached 542 women at high risk for sexually transmitted infections (stis) and unintended pregnancy two hundred nine female adolescents, aged 15 through 19 years, who were treated for c. trachomatis genitourinary infection 3407 women at pre-campaign in 12 western u.s. neighborhoods on female and male condom awareness, attitudes, and use young women who use pregnant women aged 14 to 25 years (n = 1047) to african american adolescent females seeking sexual health services adolescent females' std risk young women at risk for hiv/sexually transmitted disease (std young women female college students urban children's hospital adolescent clinic and inpatient service 424 mexican-americans and 193 african-american women were enrolled;

of the parameters measured. whilst auto-transfusion does not appear to compromise haemostasis, it does not reduce the requirement for homologous blood and heparin-bonding of the circuit has no impact. no complications or episodes of hypotension, confusion, cardiac or pulmonary compromise, febrile reaction, or coagulopathy were observed during or after the reinfusion of the unwashed, filtered, salvaged blood. the fibrin degradation products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). homologous blood transfusion was required in only 35% of patients in the study group compared with 95% of patients in the control group (p less than 0.001). no statistical difference was found in the number of patients who had excessive postoperative drainage from a drained or non-drained wound. additionally, there was no statistically significant difference between hemoglobin levels and drainage volumes in both the tha and tka study groups, compared to their respective control groups. these values in preoperatively collected autologous blood and allogeneic blood were out of normal range; (p<0.001). group 1 required 15 units of bank blood, group 2, 90 units (p < 0.001), and group 3, 102 units (p < 0.001). only 7% of patients in the autotransfusion group required an allogeneic transfusion compared with 28% in the control group (p<0.001). comparison of the two groups showed no significant difference in regard to age, sex, operations performed, or total postoperative bleeding (ats 813 +/- no complications or adverse effects were observed from reinfusion. the length of stay was reduced in those patients who received autologous blood (9 days vs. 12 days, p < 0.05 mann-whitney u test). use of autotransfusion effectively reduced the need for hbt and was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative sirs and infective complications. the use of blood conservation techniques resulted in reductions of homologous blood requirements of 34%, 60%, and 80%, respectively, in groups ii to iv as compared with the requirement in group i. significantly more allogeneic blood was required by the control group than by the reinfusion group (p = 0.022). 87.44 ml in the at patients, a reduction of 38.7% (p less than 0.05). 32 of the patients in the intraoperative cell salvage group were given any blood product, compared with 47 in the control group (odds ratio 0.47 (0.25 to 0.89); p=0.019). there was no difference between the two groups in the proportion of patients exposed to allogeneic blood (32% in both groups, relative risk 1.0 p = 0.89). global coagulation tests, antithrombin iii, and total serum protein were comparable in the four groups. the amount of hb that was transfused during the operation was significantly lower in groups ii and iii than in group i (p less than 0.0001). no differences were noted between two groups in terms of clinical parameters; likewise the operative characteristics were similar for the two groups. at d + 1, the hematocrit was comparable in all groups (ogr = 28%, sgr = 28.2% and cgr = 28.5%).(abstract truncated at 250 words) there were no significant differences between patients randomized to iat and control patients in estimated blood loss (ebl), allogeneic blood transfusion (units administered intraoperatively, postoperatively, and total), proportion of patients not receiving allogeneic blood (34% of patients randomized to iat and 28% of control patients), postoperative hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, and complications. there were no detrimental effects of autologous blood transfusion. at 20 hours after surgery, an increase of serum pct concentration (>0.5-2 ng/ml) was more frequent in group 2 (58.3% vs. 33.3%; p = 0.03). prothrombin time (pt) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aptt) did not increase, and potassium concentrations were not significantly affected.(abstract truncated at 250 words) in the two groups, no significant difference in the mean blood loss was observed during 24 hours after the operation (660 +/- the preoperative reservation of autoblood in patients with ihd for operations of coronary bypass under conditions of ec and using the cell saver gives higher values of hemoglobin and erythrocytes by the moment of discharge of the patients from the hospital, but non the less does not reduce the frequency of using homologous blood. it was also shown that autotransfusion without aspirin does reduce the need for donor blood transfusion without any increase in post-operative bleeding. the use of the autologous transfusion system (bellovac) proved to be safe but failed to reduce the need for postoperative homologous blood transfusion following uncomplicated total knee arthroplasty. the chest tube drainage was significantly less in group 1 compared with groups 2 and 3, with total drainage (median [interquartile range]) amounting to 250 ml postoperatively, in both groups, at iii, plasminogen, and protein c decreased. there was no significant difference in the mean post-operative haemoglobin levels in the two groups. total intra-hospital homologous blood replacement was not significantly different, eligible consecutive primary and revision total hip and knee replacement patients were randomized for one of the two systems or for a control group in which shed blood was not re-infused. the incidence of post-operative complications, such as wound infection, deep-vein thrombosis and chest infection, was also comparable between the groups. a cost comparison analysis showed that blood salvage was more expensive than pabt, and therefore it should be limited to patients who had predeposited fewer than three units of autologous blood. the number of patients requiring homologous blood transfusion was significantly different between the 2 groups (54/98 [55%] in autotransfused patients vs 73/100 [73%] in the control group, p =.01). the amount of postoperative autologous blood salvage averaged 946 ml. only 25% of the study group required postoperative transfusions, compared to 83% of the control group (p = .016). patients who received autologous blood had higher levels of haemoglobin at 8 hours (p < 0.05) and 24 hours postoperatively (p < 0.01) and needed less allogeneic blood transfusion (p < 0.01). the mean hb concentration was significantly higher in group a on day 1 there was no significant difference in the postoperative haematocrit and haemoglobin values between the two groups. c-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and troponin-t increased after surgery in both groups without intergroup differences. the postoperative drainage and transfusion device was efficacious in reducing the amount of allogeneic red cells required by patients undergoing knee arthroplasty, and its use resulted in a 42 percent reduction in the number of patients requiring allogeneic transfusion. there was no statistically significant difference in transfusion requirements or wound complications among the four groups. fibrin split products were elevated only in the serum of the autotransfusion patients (p < 0.002). although both groups had a decrease in lung perfusion postoperatively, there were no significant differences among the groups regarding the lung perfusion scintigraphy, chest x-rays, abg, and d-dimer values. conclusions intraoperative cell salvage and autotransfusion was associated with higher postoperative hemoglobin concentrations, a modest reduction in transfusion requirements, no adverse clinical or coagulopathic effects, and no significant increase in cost compared with controls. postoperative chest tube drainage was higher in the patients from group a, which also had the highest postoperative d-dimer levels. evaluation of clotting studies showed no significant differences between patients who received shed blood and patients who received liquid-preserved red blood cells. during the first 24 h after surgery, the autotransfusion group had a significantly higher serum level of ck-mb. in patients undergoing bilateral total knee arthroplasty, there was a 54% reduction in banked blood utilisation. the median amount of homologous blood required after operation by the study group was reduced by 74% from the amount required by the control group (mean, 67 ml vs 256 ml, respectively; p less than .0001). the use of any blood product was avoided in 95% and 80% of the patients, respectively (not significant). the estimated blood loss and cell saver return volumes were less for those patients undergoing afb for occlusive disease compared with those undergoing afb for aneurysmal disease. in the control group, 2,3-dpg levels decreased from 4.3 to 3.9 mumol/ml erythrocyte during the same period. there was an average saving of 1.1 unit of allogeneic blood per patient in group a (p<0.001). their administration caused a significant increase in tat and fpa levels in groups 2 and 3 compared to group use of cell saver reduced intraoperative net blood loss and seemed to reduce transfusions by 1 unit per patient, however, this was probably attributable to more complications leading to transfusion in the control group. cryoprecipitate and fresh frozen plasma utilization also was less in the autotransfusion group than in the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance. there was no relationship between retransfusions and postoperative febrile reactions. sonoclot coagulation analyses better correlated to both blood loss and dextran dosage than aptt and platelet count in the routine coagulation analyses. the two groups were comparable with regard to age, sex, weight, preoperative and postoperative hemoglobin levels, and surgical procedure. no clinically significant intergroup differences were found in hematologic, renal or hepatic parameters, neurologic function or use of antibiotics. autotransfusion did not produce any significant derangement of thromboelastograph values or laboratory measures of clotting pathway function (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen, and fibrinogen d-dimer levels) when compared with the effect of homologous blood transfusion (p = ns, repeated measures analysis of variance [manova]). off-pump cabg is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump cabg. the incidence of re-exploration was zero in both the groups. the clinical safety of this technique was confirmed by the lack of septic, hematological, pulmonary, renal, or hepatic complications. patient bleeding times were not significantly different between the groups at any of the time points, and the total postoperative blood loss was not different between the groups.|patients undergoing spinal surgery 113 patients two groups of patients undergoing primary total hip replacement thirty patients, undergoing elective primary

and self-monitoring of blood glucose levels. there was no difference between the two patient groups throughout treatment either in the level of igg insulin binding or the percentage of patients with insulin antibodies (igg-insulin greater than 0.012 u/l). insulin doses and blood glucose, glycated haemoglobin a1c, and fructosamine concentrations were similar during the two treatment periods. igg insulin antibody levels were identical after human insulin treatment (5.7 +/- 0.4 micrograms/l) compared to pork insulin treatment (5.9 +/- 0.5 micrograms/l). mean levels of fasting plasma glucose, glycohemoglobin, and daily insulin dosages showed no statistical differences between the two groups, and there was no significant difference in the incidence of hypoglycemic reactions. at all times the mean insulin antibody levels and the percentage of antibody-positive patients were lower in the human group compared with the porcine group. hunger and sweating without concomitant neuroglycopenic symptoms were significantly more frequent as initial warning symptoms during porcine than during human insulin (41% vs 20%), whereas neuroglycopenic symptoms were more frequent during human insulin. mean fasting and post-breakfast blood glucose levels were significantly lower with human ultralente as were fasting concentrations of glycerol and non-esterified fatty acids (p less than 0.05). no adverse reaction to either type of insulins was noted. during controlled hypoglycaemia the mean adrenaline response was 138 nmol/l/240 min for both insulins; neurohormonal responses were triggered at 3.0 (se 0.2) versus 3.1 (0.2) mmol/l of glucose for adrenaline and 2.5 (0.1) versus 2.5 (0.1) mmol/l for subjective awareness. daily insulin dose increased significantly from a mean of 51 units to 57 units (p less than 0.01) 4 months after beginning the study.(abstract truncated at 250 words) the glycemic control, as assessed by hemoglobin a1 levels, tended to deteriorate in the human insulin group during the first 3 months of the trial and then return to the baseline level. glycated haemoglobin showed no significant change six months after transfer from either bovine or porcine to human

between the insulin species with respect to glycaemic control or the frequency, timing, severity, or awareness of hypoglycaemia. in bovine-insulin-treated patients blood glucose before the evening insulin injection was higher on bhi than on bovine insulin (11.6 vs 10.0 mmol/l). women receiving human insulin required significantly less insulin per kilogram of body weight and showed significant dampening of glucose excursions (p < 0.05 for each comparison). there were no significant changes within the groups nor differences between the groups in mean preprandial capillary blood glucose, glycosylated haemoglobin or insulin dose during the first 24 weeks of the study. patients achieved significantly (p less than 0.01) lower pre-lunch blood glucose on velosulin/insulatard than on any other regimen, but severe hypoglycaemic events were more common (p less than 0.05) on this regimen. mean fasting plasma glucose (12.1 mm) and hba1 (11%) were significantly higher on b than on p, h, and sb. human insulin was shown to be indistinguishable from porcine insulin of comparable purity with respect to plasma glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and insulin dose requirements. the patients not treated with insulin showed a significant (p less than 0.05) improvement in blood glucose control 2 months after in-patient assessment but this improvement was not sustained to 6 months. the development of insulin-binding antibodies during the first year of observation was more rapid in patients treated with mc pork insulin but thereafter it was similar in the two studied groups. however, the anxiety level was significantly lower in group b. type 1 diabetic patients were efficiently and safely switched from animal to human insulin without aggravating the incidence of hypoglycaemia, in spite of two major risk factors, i.e. advanced age and diabetes of long duration. concentrations of antibody reactive with porcine and human insulins were similar for the two treatment groups, although greater fluctuation was observed in the amount of antibody reactive with human insulin. there were no statistically significant initial-final changes in the rest of the parameters evaluated although a trend of reduction in glycohemoglobin levels was observed in both groups. on comparison of the treatment periods with human and porcine insulins, no differences were demonstrated in the total frequency of symptomatic hypoglycaemia (3.10 vs 3.06 episodes patient-1 3-months-1; p = 0.94), the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (0.1 vs 0.2 episodes patient-1 3-months-1; p = 0.44), the occurrence of asymptomatic biochemical hypoglycaemia (0.75 vs 0.68 episodes patient-1 3-months-1; p = 0.81), and the capillary blood glucose concentration at the onset of hypoglycaemic symptoms (2.6 +/- no clinical reactions to human insulin occurred, and there was no significant difference in the daily insulin dose between porcine and human insulin. in conclusion, there was no improvement of metabolic control, in spite of a decrease of ia in type i diabetics treated during 6 months with less immunogenic insulin preparations. no adverse reactions, injection-site anomalies, or drug-related biochemical abnormalities were noted in either group. no severe hypoglycemic attacks or skin reactions were reported. no difference was found in 24-hour blood glucose

patients treated with fp and placebo had mean increases in forced expiratory volume in 1 second from baseline of 0.23 +/- mean morning predose percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 second increased by 2.2%, 3.2%, and 4.6% in the fluticasone propionate, 88-, 220-, and 440-microg twice-daily, groups, respectively, compared with an 8.3% decrease for placebo (p < .001 vs placebo for all groups). treatment of asthmatic subjects with inhaled steroids for four weeks leads to improvements in airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine, eosinophil counts in induced sputum, and exhaled nitric oxide levels. twice daily treatment with inhaled fluticasone propionate 50 micrograms or 100 micrograms was significantly more effective than theophylline in the treatment of mild-to-moderate asthma. the increase in pd(15)fev(1) from baseline was greater in the fp group than in the placebo group; the difference achieved significance within 72 hours and remained significant until the end of treatment. bronchial responsiveness to methacholine decreased significantly only after 6 wk of treatment with fp (p < 0.05). once-daily sfc significantly improved clinic forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (difference in means 0.129 l/s; p < 0.001) and clinic pef (difference in means 10.8 l/min; p < 0.001) compared with twice-daily fp. fluticasone propionate produced a significantly greater increase in morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 17 l/min (95% ci; 10, 24); p < 0.001) and evening pefr (adjusted mean difference over days 1-28, 16 l/min (95% ci; 9, 23); p < 0.001). the 2-wk treatment with fp significantly inhibited both early and late responses to allergen: the maximum % fall in fev1 during the early (0 to 2 h) and late response (2 to 6 h) was 32.6 +/- bal inflammatory cells decreased following 3 months of treatment with no further improvement at 12 months (p<0.05 v placebo). the combination product significantly increased (p < or =.013) area under the curve compared with placebo and fluticasone on day 1 and compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fluticasone at week 1 and week 12. the results of methacholine challenge testing averaged over all visits favored fp 200 microg/day over placebo and fp 100 microg/day (p < 0.05); there were no significant differences between placebo and fp 100 microg/day. compared with placebo, sm50 significantly reduced the numbers of neutrophils in bronchial biopsy samples and the concentrations of myeloperoxidase and soluble e-selectin in serum, each of which reflect neutrophil involvement. after 4 weeks, the maximum plasma fp concentration (cmax) in this subgroup was 0.096 microg/l [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.066-0.141] and the area under the plasma fp concentration-time curve up to the last quantifiable concentration (auclast) was 0.491 microg/l x h (95% ci: 0.256-0.940). morning and evening peak expiratory flow (pef), asthma symptoms, and supplemental albuterol use also improved in all fluticasone propionate groups versus placebo. both fluticasone propionate and flunisolide caused dose-dependent suppression of hpa axis, which was statistically greater for fluticasone propionate (p = 0.0003). the willingness of patients to use the trial drug in daily practice if efficacy would be proved was statistically significantly related to compliance during the trial (p = 0.017). finally, treatment with fsc resulted in significantly (p < or = 0.007) greater improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow, need for rescue albuterol, and asthma symptom scores compared with fp, s, and pla. treatment with fluticasone propionate resulted in significantly greater improvements in pulmonary function compared with zafirlukast (p <.05) or placebo (p <.05). values for patient-measured morning peak expiratory flow rates (pefr) were significantly (p<.05) higher and the use of rescue albuterol was significantly (p<.05) lower beginning 3 to 5 days after initiation of therapy in the groups treated with fluticasone propionate, compared with the placebo group. serum cortisol did not change significantly in either treatment group. at endpoint, fluticasone propionate significantly improved forced expiratory volume in 1 second (p < .001), morning and evening peak expiratory flow (p < .001), and asthma symptom scores (p < or = .016), and significantly reduced nighttime awakenings (p = .016; diskhaler group only) and rescue albuterol use (p < .001). fluticasone propionate powder twice daily (500 microg/day) was superior in efficacy to triamcinolone acetonide aerosol four times daily (800 microg/day) in patients with persistent asthma. low-dose inhaled fp resulted in significant improvements in eno, spirometry, qol, ds, and beta2 use. patient quality of life assessed by means of the asthma quality of life questionnaire was clinically and significantly improved after fluticasone propionate treatment (p </=.003). partial protection was demonstrated against the late-response allergen-induced sputum eosinophilia with both treatments ( p = .001). both significantly decreased airway responsiveness compared to placebo (p < 0.001), and also significantly increased lung function with no difference between the two active groups. no significant difference in clinical and functional data, and in sputum eosinophil percentages was observed between the beginning and the end of the study in both groups 1 and 2. oral candidiasis rates were 2.5% for 320-microg/d ciclesonide, 2.4% for 640-microg/d ciclesonide, and 22.0% for 880-microg/d fluticasone propionate. improvement in morning peak flow rate were also significantly (p < 0.001) greater with fp than with placebo (8-10% increase vs. 2% increase). between baseline and end point, mean values of forced expiratory volume in 1 second decreased 0.31 l in the placebo group and improved 0.39 l, 0.30 l, and 0.43 l in patients receiving 100-micrograms, 250-micrograms, and 500-micrograms fluticasone propionate, respectively. fev1 and morning peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) increased during the first week of both active treatments and were stable thereafter. methacholine improved significantly during the first 6 weeks as compared to placebo (p < 0.04) and steadily increased with time in both treatment limbs (p = 0.04), the difference in improvement between doses (100 microg fp bid, 1.6 dose steps; 250 microg fp bid, 3.3 dose steps) approaching significance after 24 weeks (p = 0.06). fluticasone propionate aerosol was well-tolerated, and it improved some dimensions of health-related quality of life measured using a standard patient survey. prednisone produced significantly greater suppression of hpa-axis function than did any of the inhaled corticosteroids or placebo (p<0.001). the fp-treated children had significantly greater (p < or = .05) reductions in 24-hour daily asthma symptom scores (-53.9% vs -44.1%) and nighttime symptom scores over the entire treatment period compared with the placebo group. the fev1, measured the morning after the last inhalation, was significantly higher after the active treatments, compared with placebo (p < 0.02), but did not differ between all active treatments. the numbers of t cells, macrophages, and eosinophils in the bronchial wall were reduced by two weeks of treatment with fp but were unaltered by placebo. measurements of peak expiratory flow and symptom scores significantly improved and nighttime awakenings and albuterol use to treat symptoms significantly declined in fluticasone propionate-treated groups relative to the placebo-treated group. 0.13 cm in the fluticasone propionate 100 microg group (p = 0.308, overall). fp-treated versus placebo-treated children showed significant changes in percentage symptom-free days, use of beta2-mimetics, morning and evening pef, fev1 % pred and wheezing. fluticasone propionate did not suppress morning plasma cortisol concentrations and did not affect 24-hour urinary free-cortisol excretion. compared to placebo, fluticasone propionate administered qd or bid significantly improved fev(1) (p < 0.001), morning (p < 0.001) and evening peak expiratory flow (pef; p < 0.001), asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.001), and albuterol use (p </= 0.001), and decreased nighttime awakenings. at the end of the first week of treatment, patients in both fluticasone groups had significantly greater improvements in morning pef than did those receiving placebo. compared with placebo fluticasone propionate was associated with a highly significant decrease in airway responsiveness (1.9 doublings of the geometric mean pd20), which was maximal at the end of the 6-week treatment period. montelukast is not as effective as low dose fluticasone in reducing or maintaining an anti-inflammatory effect in steroid naive eosinophilic asthma. the efficacies of fp100bid and fp200qd were comparable with regard to improvement in pulmonary function and asthma stability in bd patients. treatment with fsc resulted in significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow compared with fp, sal, and pla (both, p < 0.001); need for rescue albuterol compared with fp and pla (p < or =0.005); and asthma symptom scores compared with pla (p < 0.001). two weeks of regular inhaled fluticasone discontinued 24 h before allergen challenge does not offer any additional protection against the early or late asthmatic responses, increased airway responsiveness or sputum eosinophilia compared with a single dose of 250 microg immediately before allergen challenge, despite increasing baseline pc20 and decreasing sputum eosinophilia prechallenge. patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05). the effects of the inhaled glucocorticosteroid fluticasone propionate (fp) on the bronchial responsiveness to nka and methacholine were studied. the combination product significantly (p </= 0.011) reduced asthma symptom scores and supplemental albuterol use, and significantly increased the percentage of nights with no awakenings as compared with placebo, salmeterol, and fp (p </= fluticasone propionate suppressed cortisol secretion as demonstrated by a decrease in plasma cortisol auc(0-24), relative to placebo, by 29% (95% ci 15-41) and 59% (95% ci 51-66) with 440 and 880 microg b.i.d., respectively. there were no statistically significant differences at endpoint among the three fluticasone propionate groups. in the fluticasone group, significant changes occurred after 6 weeks with respect to means of pc20 (an increase of 3.4 doubling doses), plateau value fall in forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1) (from 58% at

importance of regular screening for cervical and breast cancer and intentions to go for breast screening average attendance rate attitudes, beliefs, and intentions sociodemographic factors, health behaviours, and attitudes, beliefs, and intentions|no difference in attendance was found between the intervention and control groups (49 per cent and 47 per cent). there was little variation by source of recruitment in compliance with screening recommendations, except that referrals from nbwhp were more likely (p less than 0.01) to have had a pap test and breast self-examination, while residents of public housing projects were somewhat less likely to have done so. the odds of receiving all needed cancer screening tests during follow-up were four times higher in the intervention group. overall 33 per cent of women (53 of 163) who were sent invitations attended for screening compared to 9 per cent of those not invited (7 of 80) (p less than 0.001). a randomized controlled study that evaluated a recall system and patient education material by mail in 178 asymptomatic female family practice patients aged 50 to 69 years showed no effect on the proportion of patients who had cancer screening tests (p = .20) and a significant adverse effect on the mean number of tests performed (p = .05) after 4 months. we recommend the use of patient reminder letters as a first step in a mammography or pap smear screening outreach program. an attendance of 38 per cent was obtained for women whose gp chose to send a letter with an appointment compared to 24 per cent for women whose gp chose to send a general invitation without an appointment. we conclude that mailed psychoeducational materials may be an effective mechanism to improve adherence among women with abnormal mammogram results. a mammogram was obtained by 33% of women in group 1, 37% of women in group 2, and 57% of women in group 3. age and other risk factors for breast cancer were unrelated to attendance, as was the distance between home and the screening centre. the most dramatic difference was in the higher odds that women in the intervention group would obtain a mammogram within 2 months (odds ratio = 10.5). the

better for ecf at 24 weeks, but the remaining ql data showed no differences between either arm of the study. response rate of lv5-fu2-oxaliplatin was 41% (partial response/pr 41%, stable disease/sd 31%, progressive disease/pd 28%; 95% confidence internal/95% ci 27-58) and of lv5-fu2-cddp was 25% (pr 25%, sd 36%, pd 39%; 95% ci 14-41; p =0.013). ttp for if was 5.0 months [95% confidence interval (ci) 3.8-5.8] and 4.2 months (95% ci 3.7-5.5) for cf (p = 0.088). the incidence of toxicities (leukopenia in particular) exceeding jcog grade 3 was significantly higher for group a, but no morbidity was observed. the overall response rates (complete responses [crs] and partial responses [prs]) were 15% and 43% for the fam and the pelf regimens, respectively, with a statistically significant advantage for the experimental treatment (p = .001). median overall survival was significantly longer in patients assigned to s-1 plus cisplatin (13.0 months [iqr 7.6-21.9]) than in those assigned to s-1 alone (11.0 months [5.6-19.8]; hazard ratio for death, 0.77; 95% ci 0.61-0.98; p=0.04). the improved survival was observed despite decreased 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin dosages for patients on the fat and fap arms. frequency and grade of the side effects were not significantly different between a and b group. median survival was 9.4 months with ecf and 8.7 months with mcf (p =.315); at 1 year, 40.2% (95% ci, 34% to 46%) of ecf and 32.7% (95% ci, 27% to 38%) of mcf patients were alive. significantly higher survival rates were demonstrated in those patients with recurrent cancers (p < 0.01) and those who responded to the fpepir regimen (p < 0.05). the survival rates after 12 months (30.8% versus 22.4%) and 24 months (15.7% versus 9.5%) were also higher among patients receiving pelf, but these differences were not statistically significant. toxicity was rarely severe. responder patients showed a significantly better median survival duration than nonresponders (p = .01); in arm b the median survival duration was 16 months for responder patients in contrast to 7 months for nonresponders (p = .004). there were no significant differences in all eligible patients with respect to time to progression or overall survival in the three treatment arms. duration of response and survival were significantly longer for fab in the measurable-disease group, but for the total patient population an early advantage for fab in time to disease progression and survival was lost with continued follow-up. the most frequent world health organization grade 3-4 toxic effects were gastrointestinal in study a and hematologic in study b. no treatment-related death was observed. the median progression-free survival of all patients in the hd-fu, hd-fu/fa, and hd-fu/fa/cis arm was 1.9, 4.0, and 6.1 months, respectively. similarly, the femtx group displayed significantly (p = 0.0006) prolonged survival compared with the control group, i.e. median survival 12.3 months (95% ci 7.1-15.6 months) vs 3.1 months (95% ci 1.6-4.6 months). with regard to toxicity, the fam regimen produced more anorexia, nausea, vomiting, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and cumulative bone marrow suppression. grade 3 and 4 leukopenia was observed in 9% of patients in the fe group and in 13% of patients in the fep group, with 6 cases of febrile neutropenia (fe, 4%; fep, 7%). the median overall survival time of the treated group was 9 months, whereas that of the control group was only 3 months (p = 0.001). hematologic and nonhematologic toxicity were mild with both regimens. orr was 25.0% (95% ci, 13% to 41%) for ecf, 18.5% (95% ci, 9% to 34%) for tc, and 36.6% (95% ci, 23% to 53%) for tcf (n = 119). median progression-free survival and overall survival times were 3.2 months (95% ci, 1.8 to 4.6 months) and 6.8 months (95% ci, 2.6 to 11.1 months) with lv5fu2, respectively; 4.9 months (95% ci, 3.5 to 6.3 months) and 9.5 months (95% ci, 6.9 to 12.2 months) with lv5fu2-cisplatin, respectively; and 6.9 months (95% ci, 5.5 to 8.3 months) and 11.3 months (95% ci, 9.3 to 13.3 months) with lv5fu2-irinotecan, respectively. forty-eight patients with unresectable gastric cancer were enrolled for a randomized trial of fp (n = 24) vs fep (n = 24) combination chemotherapy with respect to their effects on survival period. although fp demonstrated a higher response rate (p <.001) and longer progression-free survival than did fu alone (p <.001), no differences in overall survival were observed between the arms. median overall survival was 10.5 versus 9.3 months for xp versus fp (unadjusted hr = 0.85, 95% ci 0.64-1.13, p = 0.008 versus noninferiority margin of 1.25). the median duration of objective remission (31 vs 40 weeks) was longer using bafmi combination, and the median duration of survival, calculated in the 85 randomized patients, was slightly longer using 5-fu (28 vs 24 weeks). for ilf and elf, respectively, median progression-free survival was 4.5 vs 2.3 months, time to treatment failure was 3.6 vs 2.2 months (p = 0.4542), and overall survival was 10.8 vs 8.3 months (p = 0.2818). however, in patients older than 65 years (n = 94), treatment with flo resulted in significantly superior response rates (41.3% v 16.7%; p = .012), time to treatment failure (5.4 v 2.3 months; p < .001), and pfs (6.0 v 3.1 month; p = .029) and an improved os (13.9 v 7.2 months) as compared with flp, respectively. docetaxel based treatment (tcf) showed better palliation and improvement of global qol as compared with epirubicin based treatment (ecf). none of the three drug combinations showed a significant advantage over 5-fu alone in improved performance score, weight gain, or patient survival.|advanced pancreatic and gastric carcinoma patients with non-resectable

symptoms," "emotional function," "environmental exposure") scores and in the global aqlq score at 12 weeks (p < or = .038) compared with albuterol treatment four times daily. morning and evening peak expiratory flow rates were more improved with formoterol, and formoterol provided significantly greater improvements in asthma symptom scores compared with both albuterol and placebo. each of the four active treatments exhibited significant tachyphylaxis (p < 0.05) to protection against methacholine challenge when comparing first/last dose (as geometric mean protection ratio versus baseline): the tolerability of each drug, as reflected by adverse reactions and global assessment, was equally good in both groups. all three treatments improved asthma control, morning and evening pef rates, and spirometric indices with no change in bronchial hyperreactivity. compared with albuterol, salmeterol treatment was associated with better morning and mean peak expiratory flow (p = 0.013 and 0.016, respectively), less daytime and nocturnal symptoms (p = 0.008 and 0.01, respectively), reduced requirement of rescue albuterol (p = 0.04), and better efficacy rating by patients (p = 0.04). the bronchodilating effect of formoterol, assessed by morning premedication pefr, was significantly superior to placebo (p < 0.0001) and salbutamol (p < 0.0001). there were no statistically significant changes in fev1 or ar between the run-in period and any of the post treatment measurements for either of the treatments used. the mean overall symptom score was improved most by salmeterol treatment (p < 0.05), with the number of days with symptoms and of nights with awakenings decreasing by 22 percent and 52 percent, respectively; there were no differences in results between albuterol treatment and placebo administration. asthma-specific quality of life, both overall and for the individual domains (activity limitation, symptoms, emotional function, and exposure to environmental stimuli) was better with salmeterol than with placebo (p < 0.0001), and better with salmeterol than with salbutamol (p < 0.001). formoterol turbuhaler, 12 microg bid, was more effective than terbutaline turbuhaler, 0.5 mg qid, and placebo. salbutamol -were statistically significant. a single morning dose of salmeterol produced improvement in fev1 that was significantly greater (p < or = 0.012) than that produced by two doses of salbutamol (taken 6 hours apart) when patients were assessed 3 to 6 hours and 10 to 12 hours after the dose. relative to placebo, the mean morning pefr increased by 30 l/min (95% ci 26 to 35) for salmeterol but did not change for salbutamol. salmeterol produced a significantly higher mean morning pef (mean difference compared with salbutamol 21 (95% ci 12-31) l/min), and a significant reduction in mean diurnal variation in pef (from 30 l/min at baseline to 11 34 l/min at baseline to 32 l/min during salbutamol treatment). sb was more effective than p in increasing evening pef and the percentage of symptom-free days (p < 0.05) and rescue-free days (p < 0.0001). no changes in the beta-adrenoceptor density on mnl and no significant side effects were seen throughout the trial period. our results showed that in the run-in period there were not differences among the groups comparing the values of fev1 in % predicted, morning pefr and asthma symptoms scores. significant improvements in morning and evening peak expiratory flow, percentage of nights without awakening, and asthma symptoms were observed with salmeterol. patients receiving salmeterol 50 micrograms bd had significantly more symptom-free nights (p < 0.01) and a higher percentage of rescue bronchodilator-free days (p = 0.01). throughout the first three month treatment period, both morning and evening pefr were significantly higher on treatment with salmeterol than salbutamol (mean differences between the treatments 30 l.min-1 for morning, p < 0.001, and 11 l.min-1 for evening, p < 0.01). f was better than t (p = 0.014) and p (p = 0.0001) in improving morning pef treatment over 16 weeks with either salmeterol or salbutamol was not associated with an incidence of deaths related to asthma in excess of that predicted. the sm group had significantly more symptom-free nights than the sb group (p < 0.001), and also more "rescue-free" nights (p = 0.04). morning fev1 30 min postdrug was significantly higher in the formoterol group at weeks 2 and 8, the trend not reaching statistical significance at other times. significant improvements with salmeterol by comparison with terbutaline were also observed in daytime and night-time asthma scores, percentage of symptom-free days and nights, use of additional inhaled bronchodilator, and percentage of days and nights when no additional inhaled bronchodilator was needed.(abstract truncated at 250 words) except for the aqlq, the correlation between change in lung function and change in quality of life was generally

colleges when subjects with unknown quit status were defined as nonquitters. no significant differences were observed in abstinence rates between the two groups at 3 or 6 months. the 7-day point-prevalence tobacco abstinence rates did not differ between bupropion sr and placebo at the end treatment (53.1% versus 46.4%; odds ratio (or) 1.3; p=0.301). the results showed that the nicotine patch was effective in increasing short-term abstinence over the placebo patch and in reducing craving and withdrawal signs and symptoms from spit tobacco. three- and 6-month follow-up contacts found that the cessation rates reported by intervention participants were double those reported by participants receiving usual care (41% vs. 17% at 3 months, 37% vs. 19% at 6 months). the intervention was significantly effective in preventing incident st use but did not significantly increase cessation beyond that seen in the control group. prolonged abstinence from all tobacco was 6.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 3 months and 9.8% and 30.9% (p < .001) at 6 months in manual only and telephone counseling, respectively. no significant differences were observed between the groups in biochemically confirmed all tobacco abstinence rates at week 12 (36% lozenge vs. 27.6% placebo; odds ratio [or] 1.5, 95% ci 0.7-2.1; p = .138). long-term success was defined as no smokeless tobacco use at both 3- and 12-month follow-ups, with those lost to follow-up counted as smokeless tobacco users. no pharmacotherapies have been shown to increase long-term (> or = 6-month) abstinence rates among smokeless tobacco (st) users. there was no significant difference between groups in the prevalence of st initiation. we conclude that a tailored, interactive web-assisted cessation program can be an efficacious method for assisting adult st users to quit. the authors found that the dental hygienist-delivered intervention was effective in getting smokeless tobacco users to quit at three and 12 months and to sustain abstinence at both three and 12 months. after 7 weeks of medication, subjects on bupropion reported significantly less (p< or = 0.034) nicotine withdrawal than placebo. survival curve analysis showed that any of the 3 treatment groups involving group behavioral therapy or placebo gum were equally effective and superior to the minimal contact plus 2 mg of nicotine gum treatment in terms of abstinence. few adverse events led to discontinuation of treatment (9% (19) and 4% (9), respectively), and serious adverse events occurred in two (1%) and three (1%) participants, respectively. the cessation rates for active and placebo patch were not significantly different (exact two sided p = 0.22), while the combined patch groups had a significantly greater cessation rate than usual care (exact two sided p = 0.04). a higher percentage of baseline nonsmoking st users reported smoking at follow-up than baseline non-st-using smokers who reported using st. self-reported rates of sustained abstinence (no tobacco use at two months and six months) were 24.5% for the manual/video condition, and 18.4%, for the lifesign condition. significant between-group differences were not found for either the 12- or 18-month point-prevalence measure of abstinence from either slt only or all tobacco products using outcomes based on either the responder or intention-to-treat outcomes. the difference in relapse (no chewing for 7 consecutive days) between the active patch group (33%) and placebo group (48%) was significant at 6 months (p = .003). a significantly higher proportion of

birth weight, placental weight, head circumference, and apgar score were not significantly different and there were no stillbirths in either group. atenolol given once daily significantly reduced blood-pressure, prevented proteinuria, and reduced the number of hospital admissions. there was no significant difference in the birthweights of the babies in each group. these results indicate that early antihypertensive treatment with oxprenolol is safe for the fetus and newborn in pregnancy-induced hypertension, but has no advantage over non-pharmacological care in terms of fetal growth. patients treated with medications had significantly lower (p less than 0.0001) systolic and diastolic blood pressures throughout gestation compared with the no-medication group. birth weight was significantly lower in group b, where regimen included propranolol, compared to that of group c, for whom the regimen included pindolol (3,044.7 +/- 443.8 and 2,709.6 +/- the results suggest metoprolol to be more efficacious with regard to control of hypertension and fetal outcome in cases of pregnancy induced hypertension. more patients went into spontaneous labour following labetalol than following aldomet;

our results the three methods are comparable in the treatment of unstable trochanteric fractures of patients above 60 years old. there is no advantage to an intramedullary nail versus a sliding compression hip screw for low-energy pertrochanteric fractures ao/ota 31-a1 and a2, specifically with its increased cost and lack of evidence to show decreased complications or improved patient outcome. the mean duration of operation and fluoroscopy screening time was significantly greater for insertion of the intramedullary hip screw. there were no significant differences in functional outcome between the pfna and the dhs groups. there were no significant mechanical complications, such as fracture of the femoral shaft or failure of fixation in the gamma nail group. there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of the euroqol 5d outcome scores, the mortality rates after correction for the mini-mental score, or any of the secondary outcome measures. postoperative pain (p < 0.01), time necessary to support full weight bearing (p < 0.02), and time before returning home (p < 0.05) were reduced in the nail group. the mean time to mobilisation with a frame was shorter in the holland nail group (dhs 4.3 days, any potential for the tgn leading to a less invasive procedure and a more rapid postoperative mobilisation could not be demonstrated. decreased bleeding and post-operative pain, reduced post-operative morbidity and faster recovery of function were better but not significant in the group of intramedullary fixation (all p>0.05). patients treated with an intramedullary nail had shorter operative times, fewer blood transfusions, and shorter hospital stays compared with those treated with a 95 screw-plate. more intra-operative complications were recorded in the gamma nail group, mainly due to the mismatching of the femoral component of the nail to the small femurs of chinese people. there was no difference in the rates of cutting-out of the two implants but use of the küntscher-y nail was associated with a greater incidence of shortening. the ability to walk 15 m at 6 weeks was significantly better in the pfn group compared to the msp group with an odds ratio 2.2 (p = 0.04, 95% confidence limits 1.03-4.67). we found no difference in operating time, blood loss, wound complications, stay in hospital, place of eventual discharge, or the patients' mobility at final review. internal fixation using a fixed angle blade plate for subtrochanteric femoral fractures has higher implant failure and revision rates, compared to closed intramedullary nailing. peri-operative or immediate post-operative measures of outcome did not differ between the groups, with the exception of operation time. we found no significant differences in preoperative or intraoperative parameters. the two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand. at an average follow-up of 3.7 months all fractures were healed with no difference in functional outcome between the two groups.-- femoral shaft fractures occurred with four in the gamma nail group (2%) and none in the richard's group (p = 0.13). clinical and radiological outcomes were similar, but the gamma nail was associated with a higher incidence of complications, in particular fracture of the femur below the implant in eight cases. the reduction in the hrqol (eq-5d(index) score) was significant in both groups compared with that before the fracture (p < 0.005). there were no differences in the rates of functional recovery between the two fixation groups. no differences were found in hospital stay, surgical time, blood loss, functional outcome at 1-year follow-up, neck-shaft angle, fracture collapse, and mortality. there was no difference in intraoperative and postoperative complications or rate of fixation failure between the 2 groups, and no case of secondary shaft fracture of the femur was encountered in this study. the operation time for gamma-nailing was longer than for dhs implantation and also the postoperative blood loss was higher in the gamma-nail group. limb shortening was similar in both groups and was not affected by leaving the gamma nail unlocked distally in unstable fractures. the intramedullary hip-screw device was associated with significantly less sliding of the lag-screw and subsequent shortening of the limb in the region of the thigh (p = 0.012 and 0.019, respectively); these differences were more pronounced when the unstable fractures in the two treatment groups were compared (p < 0.001). mean operative time was 35 minutes for intramedullary nailing and 42 mintues for screw-plate fixation. there was less intraoperative blood loss and a lower rate of

there were no proven carriers, and there was no evidence of toxicity, particularly in children. the mean duration of fever was four days in the ciprofloxacin group and about five days in the ceftriaxone group (p = 0.04). eighty-nine of 116 children randomised to 2 days and 107/119 randomised to 3 days were blood culture-positive and eligible for analysis. these results indicated that azithromycin and ciprofloxacin were similarly effective, both clinically and bacteriologically, against typhoid fever caused by both sensitive organisms and mdr s. typhi. the median fct was 106 hours in both treatment arms (95% confidence interval [ci]; 94-118 hours for gatifloxacin versus 88-112 hours for azithromycin), (logrank test p = 0.984, hr [95% ci] = 1.0 [0.80-1.26]). three days ofloxacin was more effective than 14 days chloramphenicol for the in-patient treatment of typhoid fever, irrespective of antibiotic susceptibility, and was of similar cost. the clinical cure rate was 64% (40/63) with ofloxacin, 76% (47/62) with ofloxacin-azithromycin, and 82% (51/62) with azithromycin (p = 0.053). a 100% cure was observed in each treatment group and no serious side effects were observed. median (95% confidence interval) fever clearance times were 92 hours (84-114 hours) for gatifloxacin recipients and 138 hours (105-164 hours) for cefixime-treated patients (hazard ratio[95%ci] = 2.171 [1.545-3.051], p<0.0001). there were 7 treatment failures, one in the 2 d group and 6 in the 3 d group (p = 0.07). short courses of ofloxacin are simple, inexpensive, safe, and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated multidrug-resistant typhoid fever.|uncomplicated enteric fever adult men and nonpregnant and nonlactating women 41 patients;

secondary outcome measures at all visits. youths with social phobia and generalized anxiety disorder responded better to fluoxetine than placebo, but only social phobia moderated the clinical and functional response. the hamilton anxiety scale total score, psychic factor, and somatic factor and the clinical global impression severity and improvement scales showed significant differences with treatment in favor of sertraline over placebo beginning at week 4. the extended-release venlafaxine group showed statistically significant improvements in the primary and secondary outcome measures in study 1 and significant improvements in some secondary outcome measures but not the primary outcome measure in study 2. relative to baseline eeg, acute alprazolam administration increased beta power in the right occipital lead, and chronic administration increased beta power in both leads. subjects treated with fluoxetine were significantly more improved than placebo-treated subjects on parent's ratings of mutism change and global change. withdrawals due to adverse events were infrequent (5.5% [9/163] for paroxetine and 1.3% [2/156] for placebo). fluoxetine was associated with significantly greater improvement in ocd as assessed by the cy-bocs (p = .026) and other measures than was placebo. on the clinical global impressions-improvement scale, 48 of 63 children in the fluvoxamine group (76 percent) responded to the treatment, as indicated by a score of less than 4, as compared with 19 of 65 children in the placebo group (29 percent, p<0.001). compared with placebo, intent-to-treat random regression analyses indicated a statistically significant advantage for venlafaxine er (p = .001) on the sas-ca. the adjusted mean difference, -3.45 in favor of paroxetine, was statistically significant (95% confidence interval=-5.60 to -1.29, p=.002). the cy-bocs total score decreased 44% (n = 7, p = .003) after the initial 8 weeks of fluoxetine treatment, compared with a 27% decrease (n = 6, p = .13) after placebo. there was a significant improvement in observed and self-reported obsessions and compulsions that was independent of the presence of depressive symptoms at baseline. combination therapy was superior to both monotherapies (p<0.001). at the end of 8 weeks, cmi-treated patients showed a mean reduction in yale-brown obsessive compulsive scale score of 37% compared to 8% in the placebo group. nine children appeared to have moderate to significant clinical improvement, but statistical comparisons on several ratings failed to confirm a trend in favor of czp. fluoxetine patients (n = 21) had significantly lower cy-bocs scores than placebo patients (n = 22) after 16 (but not 8) weeks. in intent-to-treat analyses, patients treated with sertraline showed significantly greater improvement than did placebo-treated patients on the cy-bocs (adjusted mean, -6.8vs both fluoxetine and set-c were more efficacious than placebo in reducing social distress and behavioral avoidance and increasing general functioning. ocd response (phase i) and relapse (phase ii) criteria were based on the clinical global impression-improvement scale and the children's

relapse|evaluation of the results showed no significant differences between the two groups or between the baseline and the final ratings in each group. for total scores on the tdi, we were unable to demonstrate a significant reduction in thought pathology, although it was evident that thought disorder as reflected in the conceptual disorganization and unusual thought content subscales of the brief psychiatric rating scale is significantly reduced by neuroleptics. at the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. the cumulative relapse-free survival was 88% (se = 0.12) in the continuation and 18% (se = 0.12) in the discontinuation group (p = 0.001) at 9 months follow-up. of the placebo group 35% relapsed, relapse being related to the level of previous active medication. drugs were significantly more effective than placebo in preventing relapse and readmission to hospital. the drug was shown to be significantly more effective than the placebo in preventing relapse. eighteen (69%) of the 26 patients available for follow-up (mean interval, 3.5 years) experienced a second psychotic relapse either during the study or afterward, and 50% (14/28) of the original sample experienced a third episode. long-term treatment with asenapine was more effective than placebo in preventing relapse of schizophrenia and appeared to be safe and well tolerated. propericiazine at 10 mg and 30 mg also increased the number of symptom-free days dose-dependently but at 60 mg, the number decreased. social adjustment ratings on a special scale completed by the patients and families alike, were also found to be insensitive to treatment differences. there was a striking absence of correlation between dyskinesia change measures brought about by benztropine and changes following neuroleptic withdrawal. a proportional hazards regression model showed that life events made a significant cumulative contribution over time (p < 0.05) to the risks of relapse and that ceasing medication made an independent contribution. time-to-relapse (primary endpoint) favored paliperidone palmitate (p<0.0001, log-rank test) at interim and final analysis (n=408). these patients showed a significantly higher relapse rate than the matched control group of 26 patients who continued to receive fluphenazine (56% versus 19%, p less than .001). aripiprazole was significantly superior to placebo from baseline to endpoint in panss total, panss positive, panss-derived brief psychiatric rating scale, and clinical global impressions-severity of illness scale (cgi-s) scores and demonstrated significantly better mean clinical global impressions-global improvement scale scores (p < or = .01 for all comparisons except cgi-s: the data obtained from this study have tended to confirm the impression of previous investigators that penfluridol, administered in a dosage of 40 to 80 mg on a once-a-week basis in a single dose, compares favorably with the antipsychotic activity of those neuroleptics requiring administration on a daily basis. time to relapse was significantly longer in quetiapine xr-treated patients versus placebo (hazard ratio 0.16 mean fluphenazine levels between drug continuation and withdrawal conditions showed a progressively larger difference over time, although significant differences were not seen until week 8. although quetiapine was generally well tolerated, the rate of discontinuation due to adverse or serious adverse events was greater in the quetiapine group (18%; 16/89) than in the placebo group (8%; 7/89) (relative risk 2.29, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 5.28; chi(2)=3.20, df=1; p=0.07). to test the clinical efficacy of low dose fluphenazine decanoate (1.25 mg to 5.0 mg biweekly), we carried out two separate experiments: (1) an open trial in 57 schizophrenic outpatients, lasting 6 months; (2) a double-blind, placebo-controlled discontinuation study in a subgroup of patients who maintained good remission throughout the entire 6-month open trial. the estimated 26-week risk of recurrence was six times lower for zotepine than placebo (8.7% versus 52.8%; hazard ratio 0.16, 95% ci 0.053, 0.484; p<0.001). of those on active medication, 46% relapsed, as did 62% of those on placebo; the most important determinant of relapse was duration of illness prior to starting neuroleptic medication. the olanzapine group had a significantly longer time to relapse (p < 0.0001) than the placebo group. ziprasidone treatment was indistinguishable from placebo in assessments of movement disorders and was not associated with weight gain or cardiovascular abnormalities. the benzodiazepine-group had a significantly higher relapse rate than the neuroleptic-group, meaning that we cannot stop neuroleptics for these patients yet. among the patients who completed the study, five of 10 randomized to placebo relapsed compared with only one of eight randomized to haloperidol. in the placebo group, a 50% decrease in the mean haloperidol plasma concentration was seen 8 weeks after withdrawal of haloperidol. a poor outcome at 2 years was associated with male sex, poor outcome after the first 5 weeks of the first admission, negative schizophrenic symptoms on first admission, and a diagnosis of definite or probable schizophrenia using the feighner criteria. relapse was accompanied by a resurgence of specifically schizophrenic symptoms and by an increase in abnormalities described by the

p = 0.001). in unannounced evaluations of home drinking water, free chlorine was detected in samples from 27% of flocculant-disinfectant households, 35% of flocculant-disinfectant plus vessel households, 35% of bleach households, and 43% of bleach plus vessel households. this intervention is a useful tool for preventing waterborne diseases in families in developing countries who lack access to potable water. this impact was evident throughout the year, but particularly in the monsoon season, and in all age groups except those less than 6 months old. stored water in intervention households was less contaminated with escherichia coli than stored water in control households (p < 0.0001). in this study area, under non-epidemic conditions, the reduction of faecal bacteria in the public drinking-water supply by chlorination does not seem to be a priority intervention to reduce childhood diarrhoea. the home chlorination intervention group had the lowest diarrheal rate (28.8/1,000 subjects/month) despite lack of access to piped water in their homes. for children less than five years old, the reduction in risk was 83% (95% ci = 51-94%; p < 0.001). water filters eliminated thermotolerant (faecal) coliforms from almost all intervention households and significantly reduced turbidity, thereby improving water aesthetics. both of these home-based interventions were ultimately effective in preventing diarrhea, but only households of slightly higher socioeconomic status changed their behavior quickly enough to benefit during the first summer. children under 5 years of age whose families were not using chlorinated water had twice the risk of diarrhoea compared to children from the participating families (odds ratio = 1.98, p = 0.047). children drinking solar disinfected water had a significantly lower risk of severe diarrhoeal disease over 8705 two weekly follow up visits; two week period prevalence was 48.8% compared with 58.1% in controls, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 16.0%. the results show a 50% reduction of the incidence rate of diarrhoea and a 85% reduction of the proportion of deaths related to diarrhoea in the villages with intervention. annual incidence of diarrhoea in 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size. an intervention trial with comprehensive prevention and control for diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of east fujian, china during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health. diarrhoea rates were not significantly different among the participants while exposed to water treated with hypochlorite. water in homes was contaminated (43.4%) with more than 1100 total coliforms/100 ml due to the use of unclean utensils to transport and store water. among the 108 children in households allocated solar treatment, diarrhoea was reported in 439 of the 2-week reporting periods during the 12-week trial (average 4.1 [sd 1.2] per child). the sws was equally effective with or without cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (p = 0.73 for interaction), and together they reduced diarrhea episodes by 67% (irr = 0.33, 95% ci = 0.24-0.46, p < 0.0001), days with diarrhea by 54% (irr = 0.46, 95% ci = 0.32-0.66, p < 0.0001), and days of work or school lost due to diarrhea by 47% (irr = 0.53, 95% ci = 0.34-0.83, p < 0.0056). analysis of water samples demonstrated that there was a 69% reduction in the geometric mean of faecal coliform levels in household water and 31% less diarrhoeal disease (p = 0.06) in children under 5 years of age among the group using the improved bucket.|guatemalan children persons with hiv living in africa and large scale implementation diarrhea diseases was carried out in the rural areas of east fujian, china during 1991 to 1993, focusing on improvement of drinking water, health education, and supervision and direction to villagers to improve their environmental and family health rural north-eastern brazil 349 maasai children younger than 6 years old 314 children from the intervention area and 309 children from the control area was analysed in relation to maternal personal and domestic hygiene, controlling for education and occupation of household head and household size persons with hiv living in rural uganda 50 participating households in a rural community in bolivia;

and some liver enzyme levels than placebo. the median reduction from baseline of serum ggt (p: < 0.05) and the reductions in alcohol craving (obsessive and compulsive drinking scale: ocds) were greater in the naltrexone group (p: < 0.05), from approximately half-way through the study. naltrexone was well tolerated and there were few adverse experiences. differential treatment effects were identified after stratification according to scores on the alcohol dependence scale (ads) and depression anxiety and stress scale (dass). naltrexone also reduced risk of a heavy drinking day (hazard ratio, 0.72; 97.5% ci, 0.53-0.98; p = .02) over time, most evident in those receiving medical management but not cbi. however, the cbt-naltrexone group did better than the other groups on a variety of outcome measures. although subjects in both groups reduced their consumption of both alcohol and cocaine during the 8-week trial, there was no consistent advantage to ntx over placebo treatment. patients treated with nalmefene also had fewer subsequent relapses (p<.03) than patients given placebo. overall, naltrexone showed only modest effects in reducing alcohol drinking for the 12 weeks of treatment. subjects treated with an active medication had significantly more consecutive weeks of abstinence and less craving than those treated with placebo, but there were no significant group differences in other measures of alcohol consumption. participants in any of the randomized groups who were entry abstainers had significantly better improvement on all of the primary outcome measures. also, there were no significant differences between the study groups concerning secondary effectiveness measures as well as compliance and adverse clinical events--with the exception of the gamma-gt, which was significantly greater reduced in the naltrexone group throughout the study. the active medication group showed better medication compliance, while the number of adverse events was low overall and not significantly different by group. our findings do not support the use of naltrexone for the treatment of men with chronic, severe alcohol dependence. the most common adverse events (nausea and headache) occurred at a similar rate for patients in both treatment groups. naltrexone treatment was associated with significantly more adverse neuropsychiatric and gastrointestinal effects, poorer compliance, and a greater rate of treatment attrition. naltrexone was not better than placebo in the supportive groups, but it had a significant effect in the coping groups: 27% of the coping/naltrexone patients had no relapses to heavy drinking throughout the 32 weeks, compared with only 3% of the coping/placebo patients. individuals with high familial loading for developing alcoholism have lower levels of beta-endorphin and demonstrate a more pronounced increase in beta-endorphin levels in response to alcohol administration compared with individuals who do not have alcoholic relatives. the 40 mg group had a significantly lower rate of relapse (p < or = 0.05), and a greater increase in the number of abstinent days/week (p < or = 0.09), than the other treatment groups. long-acting naltrexone was well tolerated and resulted in reductions in heavy drinking among treatment-seeking alcohol-dependent patients during 6 months of therapy. naltrexone proved superior to placebo in measures of drinking and alcohol-related problems, including abstention rates, number of drinking days, relapse, and severity of alcohol-related problems. although more subjects in the active medication groups terminated the study early secondary to adverse events, the rates did not differ significantly from that of placebo. the combined medication was most effective with significantly lower relapse rates than placebo and acamprosate but not naltrexone. there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups on any of the outcome variables at baseline or follow up measurements. compared with placebo, the srp of ntx significantly reduced the frequency of heavy drinking days during the injection and follow-up periods. naltrexone treated patients had significantly fewer drinking days, heavy drinking days (>5 drinks) and reported less craving compared to the placebo treated patients. intent-to-treat analyses suggested that there was no overall efficacy of naltrexone and no medication by psychosocial intervention interaction. on an intention-to-treat basis, the kaplan-meier survival curve showed a clear advantage in relapse rates for naltrexone over placebo (log-rank test, chi(2)(1) = naltrexone seemed to reduce relapse rate to heavy drinking, but we found no differences in other alcohol consumption variables between naltrexone- and placebo-treated groups. the relapse rates between the two groups were not significant (p = 0.671). there were no significant differences between naltrexone versus placebo or naltrexone versus topiramate groups, but naltrexone showed trends toward inferior outcomes when compared to topiramate. rates of cocaine use and drinks per day did not differ between treatment groups; however naltrexone did reduce frequency of heavy drinking days, as did cbt without cm. drinking reductions at 3, 6, and 12 months correlated with more use of coping skills, lower urge, and higher self-efficacy. the survival function showed that patients treated with aripiprazole remained abstinent from any alcohol amount for a longer time with respect to those treated with naltrexone. the study completion, therapy participation, and medication compliance rates in the trial were high, with no differences between treatment groups. these results are supported by the lower levels of liver enzyme activities (p < 0.010 for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and gamma-glutamyltransferase), but not by the carbohydrate-deficient transferrin levels, in the naltrexone group. interactions were observed between medication group assignment and both craving level prior to randomization (p = .02) and family loading of alcohol problems (p = .05). medication interactions were found for cocaine use via urine drug screens (three way, with time) and self-reports (two way) for drug severity (two way) and alcohol use (two way). naltrexone depot subjects also had significantly fewer drinking days during treatment and a significantly greater abstinence rate than the placebo group (18% vs. 10%). the overall results are encouraging; 42% of the subjects had a remission of their depression and had no drinking relapses during the trial. naltrexone treatment response was significant within the group of 75 individuals who were homozygous for oprm1 asn40 allele. there were no differences in the frequency of any self-reported adverse effects or in liver enzyme values between the placebo- and naltrexone-treated groups. among those with eating disturbances, symptoms of eating pathology improved during treatment, but the effects did not differ according to medication condition. subjects taking naltrexone reported significantly less alcohol craving and days in which any alcohol was consumed. more patients taking the disulfiram-naltrexone combination achieved 3 consecutive weeks of abstinence in treatment than placebo-treated

and coordination (+29 vs. -2%), and 6-min walk (+15 vs. +7%). change in aggregate functional performance score (the sum of 4 functional performance test scores) did not differ between the four intervention groups nor with high-intensity prmst compared with low-resistance exercise (7 +/- manova repeated measures revealed that the hi group demonstrated the most strength gains following a speed specificity pattern (most considerable improvement occurred at or near slow speeds from 7.3% to 11.2% for male and from 2.3% to 15.2% for female). relative to controls, subjects who participated in the program achieved statistically significant lower extremity strength improvements of 6% to 12%, a 20% improvement in tandem gait, and a 15% to 18% reduction in physical and overall disability at the 6-month follow-up. rt induced a 37% reduction in shortening fluctuations at 5% of mvc and 35% reduction in lengthening fluctuations at both 30% and 65% of mvc. significant strength improvements (p<0.05), ranging between 197 and 285%, were recorded in the experimental group. the combined strength and treadmill training program and treadmill training after 12 weeks of strength training resulted in increases in peak exercise performance similar to those observed with 12 weeks of treadmill training alone. the 12-week resistance exercise intervention did not improve body composition as measured by changes in body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, or subcutaneous skinfolds. at posttest the exercisers demonstrated slower gait velocity, enhanced balance, and an improved ability to walk backward, although none of these posttest measures was significantly different from the control group. the cross-sectional areas of the knee extensors increased significantly by 5.5% in ex but were unchanged in con. baseline cortisol concentration (p < 0.01), cd20+ cell count (p < 0.05), cd3+ cell count (p < 0.05), and cd4+ cell count (p < 0.01) decreased in both groups secondary to circannual variations between winter and summer. vo2peak was increased after both rt and at (p < 0.05). exercise increased fsr of mhc by 47% (p < 0.01) and mixed muscle protein by 56% (p < 0.05). similarly, muscle endurance gains were greater for the 3-set than the 1-set group (p<.01), with no significant difference between groups for isokinetic and isometric knee extensor strength. the experimental group significantly increased in all strength measures, while the control group increased in only right leg flexion and left leg extension across the training period. at 3 months, no difference in mean change in hrqol and physical activity scores was seen between the groups, except for an increased sf-36 physical functioning score for the resistance group compared with the control group (p = 0.019) and the function group (p = 0.046). increases in muscle strength of the exercising subjects were significant compared with baseline values (28-115%) in all muscle groups. resistance training resulted in significant (p<0.05) increases in repetition maximums across all exercises (range 41-78%). no significant interaction was observed between time and group and therefore no difference in strength changes between training once a week versus twice a week after 9 weeks. results revealed significant increases in three major muscles compared to the control group. following the training, the resistance group exhibited improved ankle dorsiflexion, training resistances, and gait velocity, but showed no change in plantar flexion or postural control. strength improved 22% in the power-trained individuals and 12% in the walkers (p <.0001). peak oxygen uptake increased from 18.1 to 19.7 ml x kg(-1) bone mineral density (bmd) of the femoral neck significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 1.96% for the hex group. increase in one-repetition maximum leg press strength averaged 17.2% with testosterone alone, 17.4% with resistance training alone, and 26.8% with testosterone + resistance training (p < 0.001). high intensity, home based strength training can produce substantial improvements in strength, pain, physical function and quality of life in patients with knee oa. the coefficient of variation (cv) for force during submaximal isometric contractions did not change with training for any group. muscle strength increased significantly in both the rhgh/exercise (+55.6%, p =.0004) as well as the exercise alone (+47.8%, p =.0005) progressive resistance training had a greater effect than flexibility training on right sided quadriceps strength (mean difference between groups = 7.7%; 95% ci 3.6-11.8%, p < 0.003 manova), left sided quadriceps strength (mean difference = 9.9%; 95% ci 5.6-14.2%, p < 0.003 manova), left sided biceps strength (mean difference = 15.2%; 95% ci 11.7-19.2%, p < 0.003 manova), functional reach (mean difference = 11.7%; 95% ci 7.1-16.3%, p < 0.003 manova) and step test (mean difference = 8.6%; 95% ci 3.8-13.4%, p < 0.003 manova). between 7 and 18 months after randomization, control subjects had more outpatient clinic visits (p < .06) and were more likely to sustain hospital costs over $5000 (p < .05). serum crp levels were reduced in subjects undergoing resistance training (-1.7 mg/l) compared with controls (1.5 mg/l; p = 0.05). compared with rom, st decreased the mean rate of joint space narrowing (jsn) in osteoarthritic knees by 26% (p = not significant). although lp and ke 1rm muscle strength increased similarly in both groups asa result of the training (p < .001), lp peak power increased significantly more in hi than in lo (267 w vs 139 w, p < .001). in re the following improved (p < 0.05): strength increased by 18% (p < 0.005) in five out of seven exercises in the training group, but was unchanged in the control group. upper and lower extremity strength were significantly higher after 12 weeks of st or comt with no change after at or nt. muscle mass, muscle strength, and dynamic balance increased in the strength-trained women and decreased in the controls (p = .03 to < .001). neither type of training reversed the depressions in resting metabolism or fat oxidation rates (ie, resting or postprandial) that had occurred as a consequence of the prior weight loss. stair-climbing power also improved in the exercisers as compared with the nonexercisers (by 28.4 +/- in these, handgrip strength improved more in those given additional exercise than conventional physiotherapy (2.1 kg versus -0.3 kg, p < 0.05). those receiving resistance training alone lost more weight than those receiving the combined treatment (p= 0.029). moderate-intensity resistance exercise training in chf patients produced favorable changes to skeletal muscle strength and endurance, vo(2peak), fbf, and hrv. no significant group, exercise time, or training effects were found for cd3+, cd3+cd4+, or cd3+cd8+ cells, but there was a significant exercise time effect for cd3-cd16+cd56+ cells. fr (p< 0.01) and per (p< 0.01) groups experienced significant strength gains compared to c but were not different from each other. there was a significant overall impact across the four measures of the exercise intervention (p = 0.013). the training program improved muscle strength but did not affect plasma levels of tnf-alpha and stnfr-i or il-6. peak muscle power may be improved similarly using light, moderate, or heavy resistances, whereas there is a dose-response relationship between training intensity and muscle strength and endurance changes. there were no significant differences between s- and se-induced muscle hypertrophy (11% and 11%) and maximal strength (41% and 38%) gains of the legs as well as between e- and se-induced wmax (28% and 23%) gains. both groups significantly improved their combined lower-extremity strength (hip abduction, ankle dorsiflexion, knee flexion, ankle plantarflexion, and knee extension) (p = 0.003), but no statistical difference between the st and ft group gains (p = 0.203) was found. the results showed a trend towards improvement in both the exercise groups in both sit to stand and timed get up and go tests, but this failed to attain statistical significance. both triglycerides and the total cholesterol to hdl ratio increased significantly while total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and ldl cholesterol remained unchanged. progressive resistance exercise can produce substantial increases in muscle strength and in power standardized for body weight in healthy, very old women. in the isometric group, time to perform all 4 functional tasks decreased (p<.05) by 16% to 23%. there was a significant interaction of testosterone and exercise on quality of life in the domains of physical functioning (p = 0.03), role physical (p = 0.01), general health (p = 0.049), and social functioning (p = 0.04). isometric force improved to a greater extent in the intervention groups than in the control group. training resulted in a significant increase in vo2max in the et (+7.4%, p = 0.005) group only. increases in muscle strength of the weight trainers were significant for all seven exercises (5%-65%), with the greatest gains in the shoulder and trunk muscles. only the rt group exhibited change in structural properties: a rise in mitochondrial volume density (31%) and muscle size (10%). for each of the eight exercises, muscle strength increased in the exercise groups relative to co (p < .01), with no difference among ex1, ex2 and ex3 groups at any measurement interval. older disabled persons with osteoarthritis of the knee had modest improvements in measures of disability, physical performance, and pain from participating in either an aerobic or a resistance exercise program. at six months there was a trend for the prt intervention group to have lower gds scores than the comparison group, but this finding did not reach significance (p = 0.08). high intensity prt is more effective than is low intensity prt or gp care for the treatment of older depressed patients. quality of life subscales of bodily pain (p = .001), vitality (p = .002), social functioning (p = .008), and role emotional (p = .02) were all significantly improved by exercise compared to controls. 21%) in skeletal muscle were independently predictive of improved 6-min walk distance (r2 = 0.78; p = 0.0024). by weeks 12 and 18, all training groups were significantly stronger than controls (p < 0.01). all training groups significantly increased force, power, and functional abilities (maximal treadmill walking speed, vertical jumping, and box stepping) at week 8 (in the range from 6.5 to 20.8%) with no further improvement at week 16 (except maximal treadmill walking speed), but no significant differences were observed between the three groups. there was no significant effect of either exercise program on thigh tissue composition, except for bmd at the 1/3 site (middle third of the femur), where lo and co groups experienced a decline (p < 0.05) of -2.2 +/- 0.5% and -1.8 +/- st and sa increased significantly (p < 0.05) sit-and-reach performance, elbow flexion, knee flexion, shoulder flexion and extension and hip flexion and extension both at mid- and post-training. all exercise treatment groups revealed lower resting heart rate and rate-pressure product; lower exercise diastolic blood pressure and rating of perceived exertion; increased gxt duration; increased leg, back, and shoulder 5rm scores; and improved aahperd flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance scores. significant increases were found in the ex group for eccentric (44%) and concentric (60%) average power (p < 0.05), and improvements were seen on each functional test: the 8-foot up-and-go, chair stand, and walk time improved by 31%, 66%, and 33%, respectively (p < 0.05). no changes were found in the control group, except for decreased peak oxygen uptake (p<0.02) and quality of life scores (p<0.03). statistical analyses (analysis of covariance) showed significant strength gains (p < 0.01) in bilateral bench press (> 29%), bilateral leg press (> 19%), and unilateral biceps curl (> 20%). single-repetition maximum strength significantly improved in the prt group for lp (16.2%), paretic ke (31.4%), and nonparetic ke (38.2%) with no change in the control group. in single fibers, no changes in size and contractility were noted after 2 weeks, but specific force was higher in the training group after 12 weeks. improvement in muscle strength was significantly greater with resistance training (32% +/- the hydrotherapy group increased left quadriceps strength only at follow up, and this was significantly different from the control group. mean tug results from the pre-test were significantly lower than mean results from post-test. individual changes in ke torque/body mass before and after 18 weeks of training averaged 19.1% in the strength group, 30.9% in the endurance group and 2.0% in the controls. neither group showed a change in peak aerobic capacity or in whole-body composition, although fat-free mass of the leg increased in the exercise group. there was a group and time effect as the ex group increased 31.4% (p <.001) in strength for all muscle groups after the first 6 months of training, and the strength gains were retained for the duration of the training intervention. responses to a chronic respiratory questionnaire showed significant improvements in dyspnoea and mastery of daily living activities in the trained group. stren improved significantly in chest press and leg extension strength (p less than or equal to 0.05) while w/j and cont showed no change. training did not induce changes in pbmc subsets, interleukin (il)-1 beta, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf), il-6, il-2, or pge2 production, lymphocyte proliferation, or dth response in any of the training groups, compared with control subjects. in comparison to control group, invest group manifested significant improvements (p<.05) in leg power across measurements obtained at 75% to 90% of the one-repetition maximum. rt was not associated with changes in lv cavity size, wall thickness, mass, or systolic function after 4, 8, 12, and 16 weeks of exercise. ke strength and endurance, stair-climbing power, and chair-rising time improved significantly in the hi and li groups compared with the pc group. analysis of covariance indicated that all three exercise intervention groups significantly improved measures of functional ability, with the resistance group demonstrating the most consistent gains over the six measures. training altered the angle-torque relation: (a) displacing it by 9-31% towards higher torque values (p < 0.05); and (b) shifting the optimal angle from 70 deg (corresponding torque: 121.4 +/- all three training groups demonstrated an increase in peak isometric and isokinetic concentric and eccentric strength following 12 weeks of training (p <.01). the effect of resistance training was significant (manova f = 21.1, p < 0.001), but balance training did not improve strength, and there was no interaction (positive or negative) between balance and resistive training. mean electromyogram signal amplitude of vastus lateralis was larger in the strength-training than in the standard-rehabilitation group at 5 and 12 wk (p < 0.05). there were significant increases in type i and type ii fiber areas, and capillary density also increased significantly in the training group. the impact of strength gain on chair rise performance was significant in participants who were more impaired (p = .04). both exercise groups showed significant improvements relative to control group in upper and lower body strength, shoulder flexibility, and agility and balance exercise. resistance training that consisted of two training sessions per week was found to be at least as efficient as resistance training that included three training sessions per week, provided that the number of sets performed were equal. there was no effect of either intervention on physical health or falls, but patients in the exercise group were at increased risk of musculoskeletal injury (risk ratio = 3.6, 95% confidence interval = 1.5-8.0). although low intensity training improved (p<0.05) strength (42-66%), anaerobic power (10%), and mobility (5-7%), high intensity training elicited greater (p<0.05) gains (63-91% in strength, 17-25% in anaerobic power, 9-14% in mobility). the strength training program was very effective in improving strength in pf (+24.5%), and it thus reduced the df-to-pf mvc torque ratio; in addition, it also induced gains in df (+7.6%). maximal strength was significantly greater for the st group than for the c group (p =.015) after the intervention. all three types of group-based exercise programs significantly reduced back pain and its related disabilities, but only resistance and agility training significantly improved health-related quality of life in community-dwelling older women with low bone mass. older male exercisers achieved significant differences relative to controls in perceived anger, tension, and overall social functioning. both treatment groups showed significant strength gains (p < .05), which occurred over a wider velocity spectrum for the exercise group. performance measurements included 1rm lower-body strength, chair-rising time, walking velocity, stair-climbing time, and flexibility. muscle biopsies (n = 20) taken at the start and after the first 11 weeks of training showed a significant increase in the area of both type 1 and type 2 fibers in the biceps brachii muscle and a positive significant correlation between the percentage increase in the proportional area of type 2 fibers in the vastus lateralis muscle and the percentage increase in knee extension dynamic muscle strength.|sixty-nine of the original 86 completed the 6-month study, with five drop-outs from the

intervention was effective in reducing rehospitalizations and ed visits for very elderly participants 3 but not 6 months after their discharge from the agu. the mtc intervention reduced the mean length of stay by 1.97 days (p less than or equal to 0.04, 95% confidence interval [ci] 1.02 to 2.92 days). the intervention group patients, when compared with control patients, had a significant reduction (p = 0.005) in drug mismatch between drugs prescribed at discharge and taken at home, and had a greater knowledge of their drug regimen 10-14 days after discharge (p < 0.001). during the follow-up period, the rate of falls, hospitalization for falls, institutionalization, and death were not significantly different between the two groups. length of stay showed no difference between groups. differences in generic quality life, as assessed by the sf-36 physical component, mental component, and general health subscales, were not significantly different between the transition and usual care groups. in hospital a, the cases (n = 421) referred for early discharge planning had significantly shorter length of stay (mantel-cox, p = 0.03) than controls (n = 420), who were identical for all factors predictive of prolonged length of stay. there were no significant differences between the groups in the proportion of patients re-admitted to hospital between baseline and 3 months or 3 and 6 months. the self-care knowledge of the experimental group was higher than that of the control group (f = 11.569, p = 0.001). patients in the intervention group had 2.1 fewer days of hospitalization, but this shorter length of stay was not statistically significant (p = 0.108). a low-cost discharge-transfer intervention may improve the rates of outpatient follow-up and of completed workups after hospital discharge. from the initial hospital discharge to 6 weeks after discharge, patients in the medical intervention group had fewer readmissions, fewer total days rehospitalized, lower readmission charges, and lower charges for health care services after discharge. the percentage of medications with a discrepancy or prescription error in the control group was 14.6% and in the intervention group it was 6.1% (rr 0.42 (95% ci 0.27-0.66)). the patients in the intervention group were more satisfied with their care (p < 0.001), but there was no difference between the study groups in quality-of-life scores, which remained very low (p = 0.53). patients receiving conventional multidisciplinary care improved significantly faster between 4 and 12 weeks (median change in barthel activities of daily living index 6 versus 2; p<0.01) and had higher quality of life scores at 12 weeks (65 versus 59; p=0.07) and 6 months (72 versus 63; p<0.005). the 90-day readmission rate was 33.3% (21.7%-44.9%) for the patients receiving the study intervention (n = 63) compared with 45.7% (29.2%-62.2%) for the control patients (n = 35). total inpatient and outpatient median costs and readmission median cost were reduced 14% and 26%, respectively, for the intervention group. a nurse-directed, multidisciplinary intervention can improve quality of life and reduce hospital use and medical costs for elderly patients with congestive heart failure. those patients receiving early, systematic discharge planning experienced an increased likelihood of successful return to home after hospital admission and a decreased chance of unscheduled readmission for the 9-month study period. three patients from the control group were discharged to residential

observed between the two treatment groups with respect to the incidence of spontaneous versus induced labor, need for oxytocin augmentation, gel-to-induction interval, bishop score change, maximum oxytocin dose, maximum dilatation rate, length of labor, cesarean section rate, fetal apgar scores, fetal umbilical vein ph, or fetal umbilical artery there were no significant differences in relation to cesarean delivery rate, apgar scores at 5 minutes, and arterial umbilical cord ph, although the power of our study was limited to detect differences in proportions of adverse outcomes. no difference was demonstrated in mean time to delivery, 28.3 versus 24.0 hours (p = .19) or percent requiring cesarean section. bishop scores were altered in all patients not proceeding to labor spontaneously, but the changes were most significant in the low- and high-dose groups. the cesarean rate was also significantly lower in the pge2 group (13.1 versus 31.6%, p = .016). both groups were similar with respect to change in bishop score, start-to-delivery interval, amount of oxytocin required, mode of delivery and success of induction. coarser side effects did not occur in our group, and there is also no higher incidence of surgical deliveries. there were four failures of induction of labor in group 2 and none in group 1 (p < 0.05). in the three groups no differences were observed among 128 subjects in the weekly bishop scores, cervical dilatation or gestational age upon admission to the labor and delivery suite, the percentage of patients presenting with spontaneous labor or ruptured membranes, the number of post-date inductions or neonatal outcome. the 2 mg intravaginal gel and the 0.5 mg intracervical gel were equally effective and more effective than the 1 mg intravaginal gel in labor characteristics such as ripening time and cesarean section rate, but not in labor time. uterine hyperstimulation and perinatal outcome were similar in both groups. contrary to current opinion, intracervical dinoprostone gel does not appreciably lower the cesarean section rate when used at this dose and route before labor is induced. cervical state did not change significantly (bishop score 3.6 and 4.0) after 24 hours in patients receiving placebo gel. in addition the induction-delivery interval was shortened (median times 9.0 h vs. 11.3 h) and fewer cesarean sections were performed (16% vs. 21%) in the pge2 gel series. twelve patients in the pge2 group and two in the placebo group were delivered within 24 h (p less than 0.001). no serious adverse reactions were observed. the pge2 pessary appears to be more effective with 68% of patients either going into labour during cervical ripening or succeeding in the cervical ripening compared to around 50% in the atad and pge2 gel groups. as estimated by life table analysis, the pessaries were significantly more effective inducing vaginal delivery compared to intracervical gel (24 h: p less than 0.025, 48 h: p less than 0.01, logrank test) and vaginal delivery was obtained within 24 h/48 h in 50%/72% of the women in the pessary group and in 29%/55% of the women in the intracervical group. the results obtained showed a significant increase in bishop's score 12 hours after cervical ripening, irrespective of the way pge2 was administered: from 2.3 +/- since signs of myometrial hypercontractility were observed in the pge2 treated group as compared to the control group (p = 0.01), the authors advocate careful cardiotocographic monitoring for at least three hours after the gel application. the median interval to delivery was significantly shorter in the pge2 group, at 2.5 days, compared with placebo, at 7 days (p = .02). our results show that intracervical pge2 gel seems to have a better effect on the ripening of the cervix than the intravaginal one if we only consider the proposition of softening success (group a 14/52; group b 6/48). the 53 women who received the placebo gel had an outcome similar to that of the 47 women who received the prostaglandin e2 gel. minprostin gel (group i) and minprostin tablets (group ii) were equally effective in ripening the cervix. there were no significant differences between the groups except in the incidence of patients going into labor within 72 hours. in patients with unfavorable bishop scores the intravaginal application route resulted in a better cervical ripening, a shorter induction to delivery interval and a higher cumulative rate of deliveries during 24 h (p=0.01). twenty-three of 30 treated patients had uterine contractions lasting greater than four hours and eight patients delivered during the observation period. misoprostol is more cost-effective than the comparable commercial dinoprostone prostaglandin preparations as an adjuvant to labor induction in women with an unfavorable cervix. there was no significant difference in parity, gestational length, maternal characteristics, indications for induction or preinduction cervical scores between the treatment groups. during the observation period, spontaneous labor occurred in a significantly greater percentage of patients in the treatment group (27%) than in the control group (2%). adverse perinatal outcome in otherwise uncomplicated pregnancies of > or = 41 weeks is very low with either of the management schemes described. there was also no difference in cesarean delivery rate, antepartum fever, hyperstimulation, apgar scores, birth weight, or umbilical artery ph. compared to control subjects, patients in the group given prepidil had significant increases in cervical bishop scores, shorter induction-to-delivery intervals, lower maximum doses of oxytocin, and fewer days of induction. overall success, defined as a progression in bishop score of at least 3 points within 12 hours, was achieved in 22/40 (55%) of the gel group, 15/41 (37%) in the tablet treated women, and 8/40 (20%) in those receiving placebo. compared with intracervical therapy prostaglandin e2 given intravaginally was more likely to significantly change the bishop score (60.4% vs 40.4%, p = 0.04) and stimulate regular contractions (72.9% vs 48.1%, p = 0.01). endocervical prostaglandin e2 had a more marked effect on cervical ripeness than did vaginal prostaglandin e2, but this did not result in any differences in more substantive outcomes. gastrointestinal side effects were registered after intravaginal but not after intracervical application. significantly better results for both cervical priming and labor induction were obtained after intracervical pge2-gel application than after treatment with placebo or vaginal suppositories. there were no significant differences in the number of antepartum tests, labor inductions, or cesarean sections, the maximum oxytocin dosage, or the interval from admission to delivery in the prostaglandin e2 gel and placebo gel groups (n = 90). p less than 0.0001) resulting in a lower cesarean delivery rate, 26 vs. 47 per cent (p greater than 0.05). the following mean times were shorter for the pessary group than for the gel group: (1) insertion of the ripening agent to vaginal delivery (20.6 vs 26.4 hours, p = 0.017), (2) time to achieve cervical ripening (11.1 vs 15.2 hours, p < 0.001), (3) time to achieve active labor (18.3 vs 25.5 hours, p = 0.019), and (4) hospital stay (3.7 vs 4.4 days, p = 0.03). dinoprostone vaginal insert is more efficient than cervical gel in promoting cervical priming and labor induction in low-bishop-score patients at term. there was no significant difference between the two groups in the use of instrumental vaginal deliveries and cesarean sections nor was there any difference with regard to fetal distress. intracervical administration of dinoprostone with prelabor rupture of membrane at term and unripened cervix shortens the interval to delivery without a significant increase of maternal or neonatal

sexual, and bowel dysfunction were administered to 94 patients with no sign of recurrence a minimum of one year after curative surgery. at 1 year, patients with colostomies reported similar or significantly improved symptom scores for fatigue, pain, gi problems, and sleep disturbance, but no such improvements were observed in patients without stomas. patients undergoing caa had higher scores (better qol) for physical functioning; lower scores (fewer symptoms) for fatigue, pain, financial difficulties, weight loss and chemotherapy side effects; and higher scores (more symptoms) for constipation and gastrointestinal symptoms compared with apr patients. in general, men had lower social well-being scores, and younger patients had lower physical and emotional well-being scores and colorectal concerns scores. patients without a terminal abdominal stoma had a better score in six categories of the qol 30 and in two categories of the cr38. overall, quality of life was good but cpa patients had better quality of life scores than apr and lra patients. the failure rate was higher for older patients (p = 0.005) and for coloanal pull-through anastomosis (p = 0.001). overall, patients with rectal cancer recover well in the long run, with hrqol levels comparable to that of the general population. a significantly ( p< 0.001) greater number of patients in the abdominoperineal resection group stopped praying daily (either alone or in a mosque) and fasting during ramadan. we found convergent and divergent validity and good reliability of the fact-c. patients' overall qol was lower at one month after colectomy and recovered to the pre-surgery level at six months after colectomy. there was no significant difference in both the short-term and the long-term complication rates between the two groups of patients. the quality of life was significantly better after resection than after excision, most clearly so according to the grogono index, and this was also reflected in the patients' personal assessment. stoma construction (n = 51) was associated with a higher global health status (83 vs. 75, p = 0.019), and these patients reported fewer gastrointestinal problems (p = 0.001). stoma patients experienced greater financial worries (p = 0.0029), whereas nonstoma patients had greater gastrointestinal concerns (p = 0.0098). the presence of a stoma did not affect the qol of the male patients, while it did affect that of the female patients. although patients having had apr tended to report a lower body image score (p = 0.12) and more sexual dysfunction in male patients, all apr patients tended to report better physical function, future perspective and global qol. male patients with a stoma had more sexual problems than males without a stoma (p = 0.015). both genders had impaired sexual life; however, males had significantly higher values and felt more distressed by this impairment. the only significant difference between the two groups was found in the total score of the symptom-specific scale in favour of anterior resection (p = 0.02). no difference was detected in any sf-36 health survey hrqol domain among the groups, although there were differences within groups before and after surgery. no significant results were obtained for the remaining scores, but patients undergoing ape consistently had more favorable qol scores than those undergoing ar. there was no significant difference in global health-related quality of life between patients with and patients without a stoma at any time point. based on the sf-36v2, statistically significant and meaningful differences between female cases and controls were observed for seven of the eight scales and on the physical and mental component summary scores. patients with lar had a better body image (p.001), dietary habits (p.003) and tolerance to stress (p.004). mean qol scores for body image and male sexual problems were better following ar than apr (p<0.01), also in patients with a low (< or = 3 cm) anastomosis. quality of life scores for the various factors studied showed that quality of life was worse in women, in patients with tumors in the middle third of the rectum,

problems at the conclusion of the trial, indicating that the close monitoring program is effective, feasible and valuable. when compared with the group receiving tau, there was a trend for the intervention group to experience less depression in time. the telephone care management program had smaller effects on patient-rated improvement (66% vs 55%, p =.04) and satisfaction (47% vs 29%, p =.001); effects on mean depression scores were not statistically significant. this program of telephone-delivered cbt combined with a pedometer-based walking program did not improve a1c values, but significantly decreased patients' blood pressure, increased physical activity, and decreased depressive symptoms. improvements in ham-d scores were significantly greater in the intervention group at 6 weeks (p = .04), 3 months (p = .02), 6 months (p < .001), and 12 months (p < .001). compared with control patients, intervention recipients had lower mean phq-9 values in depression symptoms (-1.41 intervention patients also reported significantly higher rates of mental health care (32.1% vs 17.2%, p<.001) and psychotherapy or counseling (32.0% vs 21.2%, p = .007). the decrease in the number of women taking antidepressants after 3 months was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (multicomponent intervention from 60/101 [59%; 95% ci 49-69%] to 38/106 [36%; 27-46%]; usual care from 18/108 [17%; 10-25%] to 11/102 [11%; 6-19%]). telehealth care improved mental functioning at 6 weeks (47.07 vs 42.64; p =.004) and treatment satisfaction at 6 weeks (4.41 vs 4.17; p =.004) and 6 months (4.20 vs 3.94; p =.001). despite few resources and marked deprivation, women with major depression responded well to a structured, stepped-care treatment programme, which is being introduced across chile. centralized telecare management coupled with automated symptom monitoring resulted in improved pain and depression outcomes in cancer patients receiving care in geographically dispersed urban and rural oncology practices. there was no difference in the rate of new prescriptions for, or adequate dosing of, anti-depressant medications. self-diagnosed depressed women (vs nondepressed women) had more depressive symptoms and acute care visits, worse general and mental health, and greater impact of health problems on regular activities. when compared with usual care patients, intervention patients showed greater improvement in adequacy of dosage of antidepressant medication treatment in the first 6-month period (odds ratio [or], 4.15; 95% confidence interval [ci], 2.28-7.55) and the second 6-month period (or, 2.90; 95% ci, 1.69-4.98), less depression severity over time (z = 2.84, p = .004), a higher rating of patient-rated global improvement at 6 months (intervention 69.4% vs usual care 39.3%; or, 3.50; 95% ci, 2.16-5.68) and 12 months (intervention 71.9% vs usual care 42.3%; or, 3.50; 95% ci, 2.14-5.72), and higher satisfaction with care at 6 months (or, 2.01; 95% ci, 1.18-3.43) and 12 months (or, 2.88; 95% ci, 1.67-4.97). there was little difference in outcome between the two treatment arms but a gradual improvement in symptoms over time was seen. 90% of intervention patients rated their depression care as good or excellent at six months compared with 75% of usual care patients (p = 0.0003). intervention patients had significantly fewer depressive symptoms, but not fewer episodes of relapse/recurrence over the 12-month follow-up period. intervention patients with minor depression were found to have a significant decrease over time in depression severity on only 1 of 4 study outcome analyses compared with usual care patients. blinded interviews by telephone 3 and 6 months after the initial prescription included a 20 item depression scale from the hopkins symptom checklist and the structured clinical interview for the current dsm-iv depression module. random regression analyses showed that cc patients improved significantly more over time compared with uc patients on anxiety, depression, and disability measures, with the greatest effects at 3 and 6 months. integrated care was associated with more mental health and substance abuse visits per patient (mean=3.04) relative to enhanced referral (mean=1.91). in patients with major depression, the intervention group had greater adherence than the usual care controls to adequate dosage of antidepressant medication for 90 days or more (75.5% vs 50.0%; p < .01), were more likely to rate the quality of the care they received for depression as good to excellent (93.0% vs 75.0%; p < .03), and were more likely to rate antidepressant medications as helping somewhat to helping a great deal (88.1% vs 63.3%; p < .01). at 6 months, there were no clinically or statistically significant differences the 2 groups in hamd or sf-36 scores or any of the secondary outcome measures. intervention participants were more likely to report treatment response (33.3% vs 17.5%) (odds ratio, 2.50; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.37-4.56) and remission (22.0% vs 11.9%) (2.25; 1.11-4.54) at 6 months but not 12 months. serious adverse events did not differ between the 2 groups. gcms most often addressed comorbid conditions (36%), then social issues (27%) and appointment reminders (14%). one-month post-trauma intervention subjects when compared to controls demonstrated statistically significant decreases in ptsd symptoms as well as a reduction in depressive symptoms. patients offered the program had higher rates of antidepressant adherence (81% continued treatment more than 3 months vs. 61%, p = 0.001), lower symptom checklist depression scores after 5 months (0.95 vs. 1.17, p = 0.043), and greater satisfaction with depression treatment (53% "very satisfied" vs. 33%, p = 0.004). in a repeated measures linear model with adjustment for baseline scores, the phone therapy group showed significantly lower mean hopkins symptom checklist (hscl) depression scale scores (l. derogatis, k. rickels, e. uhlenhuth, & l. covi, 1974) from 6 months to 18 months versus usual care, f(1, 336) = ongoing intervention significantly improved both symptoms and functioning at 24 months, increasing remission by 33 percentage points (95% confidence interval 7% to 46%), improving emotional functioning by 24 points (11 to 38) and physical functioning by 17 points (6 to 28). the intervention also improved anxiety and fatigue but not pain or physical functioning. intervention patients experienced significantly better physical functioning at 1 year than usual-care patients as measured using between-group differences on the pcs of 1.71 (95% confidence interval (ci)=0.96-2.46) and iadls of -0.15 a significantly greater improvement for calm vs uc in global anxiety symptoms was found (bsi-12 group mean differences of -2.49 implementing a routine screening protocol using the phq-9 and depression care management quality improvements is feasible in diverse home health care organizations and results in consistently better (but not statistically significant) depression outcomes in the int group. patients in the care management and usual care groups did not differ in terms of their outcomes. the pearls program, a community-integrated, home-based treatment for depression, significantly reduced depressive symptoms and improved health status in chronically medically ill older adults with minor depression and dysthymia. intervention patients also experienced greater rates of depression treatment (or, 2.98; 95% ci, 2.34-3.79; p<.001), more satisfaction with depression care (or, 3.38; 95% ci, 2.66-4.30; p<.001), lower depression severity (range, 0-4; between-group difference, -0.4; 95% ci, -0.46 to -0.33; p<.001), less functional impairment (range, 0-10; between-group difference, -0.91; 95% ci, -1.19 to -0.64; p<.001), and greater quality of life (range, 0-10; between-group difference, 0.56; 95% ci, 0.32-0.79; p<.001) than participants assigned to the usual care group. the intervention patients reported greater improvements in mental hrql (all p < or = .02) (sf-36 mcs: delta, 3.2 points; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.5-6.0), physical functioning (dasi: there were three deaths and four suicide attempts in the collaborative stepped-care group and six deaths and six suicide attempts in the enhanced usual care group. we found no evidence that the drp program was more effective than cau and no indications for added beneficial effects of either the psychiatric evaluation or the cbt treatment to the basic format of the drp program. the interaction between intervention condition and time was also significant (p <.05), indicating that tdm patients improved significantly more over time than did uc patients. intervention patients were more likely to respond by 6 months (or = 2.0, p = .02), and remit by 12 months (or = 2.4, p = .02). there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in depression symptoms, quality of life, medication adherence, provider visits, or patient satisfaction. patients in the intervention group also were more likely to have one or more adjustments of insulin (p=0.006), antihypertensive medications (p<0.001), and antidepressant medications (p<0.001), and they had better quality of life (p<0.001) and greater satisfaction with care for diabetes, coronary heart disease, or both (p<0.001) and with care for depression (p<0.001). patients in the intervention group were less likely to suffer from major depressive disorder at follow up compared with usual care (0.32, 95% confidence = interval = 0.11 to 0.93, p = 0.036). int patients had significantly greater depression improvement (> or =50% reduction in symptom checklist-20 depression score from baseline; 57, 62, and 62% vs. the euc group's 36, 42, and 44% at 6, 12, and 18 months, respectively; odds ratio 2.46-2.57; p < 0.001). with respect to the measures used and pilot study objectives identified, there were no statistically significant differences between the study groups in treatment adherence to the prescription of antidepressant medication or in the incidence and severity of adverse events to medication. improvement was also found for 5-point decrease in phq-9 score among 72.2% of intervention patients compared with 59.7% of euc patients (or = 1.99; 95% ci, 1.14 to 3.50; p = .02). although limited by small sample size, pilot results suggest culturally tailored, telephone-based cbt has the potential to enhance access to psychotherapy in an underserved latino population with little access to mental health services. a total of 577 patients were recruited; 516 [89% (95% ci = 86-92%)] were rated as depressed on the bdi and 474 [82% (95% ci = 79-85%)] met criteria for dsm-iii major depression. collaborative care produced greater improvement than cl in depressive symptomatology from baseline to 3 months (scl-20 change scores), but at 9 months there was no significant difference. the cc group demonstrated no difference (-0.07%; 95% confidence interval [ci], -4.2% to 4.3%) in the adjusted rates of change in ptsd from baseline to 12 months, whereas the uc group had a 6% increase (95% ci, 3.1%-9.3%) during the year. there were no differences in probability of having any medical visit at any point (each p > or = .21). however, psychiatrist-enhanced pep and cbt-enhanced pep patients reported lower bdi severity during follow-up than uc patients [mean difference 2.07 (95% confidence interval (ci) 1.13-3.00) and 1.62 (95% ci 0.70-2.55) respectively] and pep patients [2.37 (95% ci 1.35-3.39) and 1.93 (95% ci 0.92-2.94) respectively]. effects were not mediated by antidepressant medication or specialty care counseling in urban or rural patients. the combined cognitive-behavioral and pharmacotherapeutic intervention resulted in sustained and gradually increasing improvement relative to treatment as usual, with significantly higher rates at all points of both the proportion of subjects remitted (3 months, 20% vs 12%; 12 months, 29% vs 16%) and responding (3 months, 46% vs 27%; 12 months, 63% vs 38%) and significantly greater improvements in world health organization disability scale (all points) and short form 12 mental health functioning (3 and 6 months) scores. rates of suicidal ideation declined faster (p =.01) in intervention patients compared with usual care patients; at 4 months, in the intervention group, raw rates of suicidal ideation declined 12.9% points (29.4% to 16.5%) compared with 3.0% points (20.1% to 17.1% in usual care [p =.01]). the cts and lts were equally successful when these conditions could be met, but cts were more successful than lts in less supportive environments. collaborative care significantly improved clinical symptoms and functional status of depressed patients with coexisting chronic general medical conditions receiving treatment for depression in primary care practices in puerto rico. there was significant clinical improvement for depression in both groups, with a trend toward significance in the more intensive module. the percentage of patients with an sdcs "very satisfied" score (≥8) at day 112 was not significantly different in the venlafaxine er and venlafaxine er+d groups (63% and 58%, respectively; p = 0.22). participation in care management was high in the three intervention groups. comprising of both organisational and patient level components, collaborative care is a potentially powerful intervention for improving depression treatment in uk primary care. the pearls program, a community-integrated, home-based treatment for depression, effectively reduces depressive symptoms in adults with epilepsy and comorbid depression. enrolled intervention site patients were more likely to receive appropriate antidepressant care (66% versus 43%, p = 0.01), but showed no significant difference in symptom improvement compared to usual care. collaborative care subjects were far more likely to receive adequate depression treatment by discharge (71.9% collaborative care vs. 9.5% usual care; p < 0.001). the pharmacist intervention proved equally effective in subgroups traditionally considered difficult to treat: those with chronic depression and dysthymia. or=50% improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the personal health questionnaire (or=4.51, 95%

cognitive scores culminated in significant group differences on the mccarthy gci at ages 36 and 48 months, when the lbw experimental group caught up to the nbw group. using linear regression analysis, intervention was associated with improved scores: portage: +4.3 gq points (95% ci 1.6 to 7.0); parent adviser: +3.4 gq points (1.4 to 6.1). orientation and state regulation of infant behavioural profiles, the stai and lcc scores significantly improved in the eip group (mean difference (95% ci): the behavioral rating scale of the bsid-ii (p = .000) and the iba (more approach [p = .003] and less stress [p = .001] over time) also favored the intervention infants. their mothers rated their infants' temperaments more optimally, expressed more realistic developmental milestones and child-rearing attitudes, and received higher ratings on face-to-face interactions. there was no significant difference in mental development index (-0.9 points; 95% ci, -5.0, 3.2) or psychomotor development index (2.5; -3.3, 8.4) scores between the intervention and control groups and no significant effect of intervention on mental development index or psychomotor development index scores for subgroups dichotomized by gestational age (<28 weeks/> or =28 weeks), parity (1st/other child) or mother's cohabiting status (supported/unsupported). it is concluded that this amount of occupational therapy in at-risk children does not have a relevant effect on neurological development. there was no significant difference in biological factors among the two premature groups and in cultural and social factors among the three groups. experimental infants tended to exhibit better motor and mental performance and had 23% fewer cerebral palsy diagnoses at 1 year, but these trends were not statistically significant. cope mothers were significantly less stressed by the nicu sights and sounds and had significantly stronger beliefs about what behaviors and characteristics to expect from their premature infants. there were no differences between the groups in cognitive or motor outcomes. the infants will be stratified by severity of brain white matter injury (assessed by magnetic resonance imaging) at term equivalent age, and then randomized. the low birth weight infants obtained significantly lower bayley mental and motor scores, and were more passive and less intense than the higher birth weight infants. the results indicated the experimental infants made significant gains in neurological development (p less than .001), weight gain (p less than .04), and mental development (p less than .05). the intervention group showed the greatest improvement. changes in mental development were not independent of changes in the glos. at 36 months of chronological age, as compared to controls, children in intervention group exhibited higher scores in personal-social subscales ([mean (s.d.)]=101.4 (9.3) vs. 92.9 (12.1), p=0.02), eye-hand coordination (92.7 (4.5) vs.

control groups. at-risk infants had higher mean neurodevelopmental scores throughout the study period and lower 1-year development quotients (dq) than normals. the t group subjects with high levels of parental compliance had better scores on the aims than those with lower parental compliance (p = 0.05). the data we present reveal the considerable effectiveness of the ihdp intervention in enhancing

the sedentary controls either became more depressed or reduced their participation in pleasant, socially oriented activities. no differences were observed between groups, except for a trend toward greater improvement in hdl cholesterol levels in the ex group (p = 0.07). multiple regression analysis indicated that the improvement in quality of life depended on the participation in exercise programmes, the effects of training and the reduction in the level of depression. exercise training in rhuepo-treated hemodialysis patients resulted in an improved aerobic exercise capacity, whereas those without exercise training did not have increased capacity. after training significant improvement occurred in physical capacity (vo2max increased from 16.8+/-6.2 to 23.2+/-7.6 ml/kg/min, p < 0.05). exercise did not alter gfr, hemoglobin, glycated hemoglobin, serum lipids, or c-reactive protein (crp). improvement of the variables in the yoga-based exercise program was found to be superior to that in the control group for all the variables except calcium, phosphorus, hdl-cholesterol and triglyceride levels. the exercise program had no effect on qol scores and this was most likely due to the short duration of the exercise program and high-functioning level of the population studied as compared to normative data for this patient population. in the trained group, changes in oues correlated with those in the maximum oxygen uptake (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) and the anaerobic threshold (r = 0.61, p < 0.01). moderate- to high-intensity strength training improves physical performance, nutritional status and quality of life in people with chronic kidney disease and in dialysis patients. the serum albumin levels and cgr increased in the training group compared with baseline. there was an overall improvement in pwv, and to a lesser extent bnp levels, with 3 months of intradialytic exercise compared with no exercise, suggesting that regular exercise in eskd may be associated with improvements in arterial compliance and a reduction in cv risk. the eg had a significant increase in aerobic capacity, 'squat test' and physical function and physical component scale (sf36). " at baseline hrv index, mean rr, sdnn, and aerobic capacity were significantly reduced in both hemodialysis groups compared with values in group c. also, 40% of all patients on hemodialysis and 16% of group c had arrhythmias (lown class >ii). support group participants reported a significant decrease in pleasant activities while there was no change in the exercisers.|maintenance dialysis patients fifty participants (mean 48 patients who met the criteria for hematocrit and exercise adherence and completed both baseline and post intervention (5.6 people with chronic renal failure 30 patients (group b) and 30 nonuremic sedentary persons (group c) remained untrained and were used as controls hemodialysis (hd) patients tufts university, boston, massachusetts one hundred sixty-seven patients hemodialysis patients treated with 70 hemodialysis patients from 3 renal units patients with esrd undergoing hemodialysis (hd hd patients patients undergoing an exercise program rhuepo-treated hemodialysis patients patients with end-stage renal disease transplant recipients patients with chronic renal insufficiency treated with a low-protein diet twelve patients (control group) lived without predialysis and dialysis patients 13 years) receiving long-term haemodialysis (3.7 38 end-stage renal disease patients on maintenance hd exercising versus nonexercising individuals with end-stage renal disease end-stage renal disease patients skeletal muscle of dialysis patients fifteen sex- and age-matched sedentary individuals (group e -

p less than .01) and length of hospitalization (p less than .05). the infusion tom took a mean 13 h less than the other two methods, which were statistically indistinguishable. this trial determined that early catheter removal may be feasible and desirable in patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy. postoperative normal bladder function resumed more rapidly when transurethral closed drainage was used (p < 0.05). in a randomized trial, treatment of urethral stricture by direct visual internal urethrotomy with 3 days of postoperative catheterisation was found to be sufficient, given minimal complications, and had a cure rate of 85% after 6 months and 80% after 1 year follow-up. in study 1, infection was significantly reduced with respect to all parameters in the group receiving two doses of cefotaxime, and total drug treatment costs were halved. there were no statistically significant differences in either the duration of continuous catheter drainage before the return of spontaneous voiding or the incidence of urinary tract infection in the two groups. residual volumes exceeding 200 ml and need for recatheterisation occurred in 9% in the standard prolonged catheterisation group versus 40% of patients in the not prolonged catheterisation group (or 0.15, 95% ci 0.045-0.47). the postoperative urinary tract infection rates of groups a and b were 16.6% and 23.3%, respectively ( p>0.05). the results show that those patients who were less time under vesical drainage presented a minor frequency of urinary retention after surgery (24.3% vs 30.7% and 43.7%). no significant difference was noted in the incidence of uti (5 vs. 10, p = 0.25), with a trend towards less uti in group 1. delayed voiding occurred in 13 (28.9%) and 10 (21.7%) patients, respectively, and 5 (11.1%) and 3 (6.5%), respectively, received a new catheter. catheter removal on day 1 led to a significantly shorter post-operative hospital stay (2.3 days versus 3.3 days) and did not incur a higher incidence of complications. there was no significant difference in bacteriuria after 14 days (50.0 vs. 53.3%). asymptomatic bacteriuria at catheter removal was found in 21.0% of suprapubic and in 12.5% of transurethral catheter patients. a randomized prospective study was set up to assess the role of postoperative catheter drainage and the value of hydraulic self-dilatation of the urethra after internal urethrotomy. the early removal of in-dwelling catheters after operation was not associated with an increased rate of febrile events, urinary tract infections, or need for recatheterization. in addition, 29% of the catheterized group had urinary tract bacteriuria compared with 13% of the uncatheterized group (p < 0.025). there was no significant difference between the 2 groups with respect to pathology, weight of prostatic resection, mean volume of first void, or time to first void after catheter removal. urinary retention after 7 days was present in 23.99% with suprapubic vesical drainage and 28.5% with urethral catheter. of 25 patients catheterized for both group postoperative urinary retention occurred in 2 (8%) and required a new catheter. no significant difference in recurrence rate was found between the two groups studied by means of voiding interview, uroflowmetry and retrograde urethrography. patients who had their catheters removed at midnight passed a greater volume of urine with both their first (268 ml compared with 177 ml; p<0.0001) and second voids (322 ml compared with 195 ml; p<0.0001) than their counterparts in the 0600 group. removing the catheter at midnight allows patients to return to a normal voiding pattern more rapidly and to leave hospital earlier. bladder infusion before a tov after turp significantly increases the rate of readiness for discharge, allowing an early decision to discharge on the second day in a large proportion of patients. at follow-up after one year, postoperative bacteriuria was closely correlated to increased rates of both clinical cystitis and asymptomatic significant bacteriuria.|urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria after vaginal plastic surgery patients undergoing anterior colporrhaphy 180 patients were evaluated 101 with latex and 79 with bardex ic catheters 18 patients with the 118 consecutive patients who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate (turp) or bladder neck incision (bni) underwent tom by one of the three methods forty-eight patients who had undergone transurethral resection of the prostate 86 patients with genuine stress incontinence who underwent a modified burch coplosuspension stress urinary incontinence (burch or marshall-marchetti-krantz 54 patients fifty-one patients with clinical and urodynamic diagnoses of stress urinary incontinence one hundred patients were included sixty-two patients were admitted into the study and followed-up for two years urinary catheters after transurethral resection of the prostate patients' readiness for discharge and the day of discharge after transurethral resection of the prostate (turp ninety-one women undergoing prostatectomy 42 patients who had the 75 consecutive patients undergoing turp who were randomized to either have their catheter removed in the standard manner (38 patients), or to undergo bladder infusion before a trial of voiding (tov) on the second day after turp (37 patients patients with preoperatively sterile urine patients' resuming normal voiding patterns 213 patients 59 patients patients undergoing the pereyra surgical procedure ninety-two patients with preoperative sterile urine undergoing six patients were excluded: four in the standard prolonged catheterisation group and two in the not prolonged catheterisation group stress urinary incontinence and/or genital descensus 250 women who underwent hysterectomy and who did not require bladder suspension or strict fluid treatment patients undergoing radical perineal prostatectomy 100 patients who were blindly randomized to have either an fifty women undergoing vaginal plastic repair to either 1 or 3 days catheterization patients with preoperatively sterile urine undergoing patients (n = 89 one hundred and sixty patients were entered into the study twenty-four patients who underwent radical hysterectomy and pelvic node dissection for cervical carcinoma urinary catheters fifty patients with diagnoses of pelvic floor relaxation or stress urinary incontinence 213 patients who underwent transurethral surgery for benign prostatic hyperplasia patients with urethral catheter after retropubic incontinence surgery after vaginal prolapse surgery between january 1994 and july 1995, fifty two patients with urinary stress incontinence underwent pereyra procedure, 31 female patient with prostatic resection 628 patients 90 women undergoing after transurethral resection of the prostate syndrome 106 patients submitted to vaginal surgery 43 patients who had the

duration of diarrhea|the duration of the diarrhoea was not influenced by the intake of probiotics. baseline characteristics such as mean age and the average frequency of stools were comparable in s. boulardii and control group at the time of inclusion in the trial. patients with acute enteritis showed a significantly faster resolution of bowel abnormalities during treatment with enterococcus sf68 compared with placebo. the time to recovery after early treatment was 79 h vs. 139 h in the placebo group (p = 0.02); 1 of 17 patients treated early vs. 6 of 13 in the control group still had loose stools 120 h after start of treatment (p = 0.03). the frequency and duration of diarrhea, requirement for intravenous therapy, and hospital stay were significantly lower in both the intervention groups compared with the controls. administration of l. rhamnosus strains shortens the duration of rotaviral diarrhoea in children but not of diarrhoea of any aetiology. in the rotaviral diarrhea and in those who had diarrhea of less then 60 hours the difference did not reach statistical significance. there was a significant (p < 0.05) difference in diarrhoea frequency on day 2 between probiotics (3.3 [loose stools]; 2.5-4.3) and placebo (4.7; 3.8-5.7) groups. significant differences were observed on days 14 (ecn 93.3%, placebo 65.8%, p = 0.0017) and 21 (ecn 98.7%, placebo 71.1%, p < 0.001). median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (p<0.001) in children who received l rhamnosus strain gg (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). there was no difference in groups in the duration of diarrhea or numbers of stool on days 3, 6, or 10 of treatment. stool-reducing substances (> 1%) were detected more frequently in the mf group, and the differences were significant for day 3 of the study (p = 0.04). the percentage of cd8 lymphocytes on day 7 was significantly higher in group 1 than group 2. when compared to the placebo, bifilac showed clinical as well as statistically significant reduction in number of episodes (frequency) of diarrhea in a day, mean duration of diarrhea (in days) degree of dehydration, duration and volume of oral rehydration salt [ors] therapy, duration and volume of intravenous fluid [ivf] therapy, duration of rotaviral shedding (p<0.01). the median duration of hospitalization was significantly shorter (p = 0.017) in patients who received nitazoxanide (81 h) and probiotics (72 h) compared to patients who received oral rehydration solution alone (108 h). the duration of diarrhea was 82 h in the treatment group vs. 101 h in the control group (not significant, p = 0.07). stool frequency was less on the second day in the lactobacillus group (p < 0.05). l. reuteri effectively colonized the gastrointestinal tract after administration and significantly shortened the duration of watery diarrhea associated with rotavirus. however the stool frequency and duration of hospitalization were not significantly different (p > 0.05, study group vs control group). even on day 3, mean loose stool frequency and frequency of ors use and frequency of intravenous fluid use was significantly lower in the drug group. there was no significant reduction in diarrhea duration and stool output in the group. s. boulardii seems to be a promising agent for the amelioration of the course of acute diarrhoea in children when used therapeutically. lgg supplementation does not decrease the frequency and duration of diarrhoea and vomiting in children with awd, and does not reduce hospital stay in these patients. no significant difference was observed by 48 hours in those presenting with bloody diarrhea. hospital stays were significantly shorter in group b than in group a. administering oral rehydration solution containing lactobacillus gg to children with acute diarrhea is safe and results in shorter duration of diarrhea, less chance of a protracted course, and faster discharge from the hospital. stools had a normal consistency on day 3 in 38 (76%) of 50 patients in the s. boulardii group compared with only 12 (24%) of 50 in the control group (p = 0.019). duration of diarrhea and number of stools were significantly less in group y compared with group m. forty-eight hours after inclusion, diarrhea was still present in 62% of group m versus in 35% of group y (p < 0.002). six days after the onset of diarrhea, stools in only 4 out of 31 children that received lactobacillus gg were positive for rotavirus compared with positive findings in 25 out of 30 control subjects. significant differences were observed in mean hospitalization days (p=0.035), reduction in diarrhea frequency (p=0.049) and weight gain (p=0.017). there was no difference between the study group and control group in the frequency of diarrhea stools on the day before admission (p > 0.05). no effect of st11 treatment on severe rotavirus diarrhea was observed. no intergroup differences were found in beta-glucuronidase, beta-glucosidase, and glycocholic acid hydrolase levels. a statistically significant difference was observed in the number of stools on the 4th and 7th day favouring the subgroup that received early treatment (within the first 48 h of the onset of diarrhoea). patients receiving lgg had a significantly shorter duration of watery diarrhoea [mean (sd) 2.7 (2.2) days] than those receiving the placebo [3.7 (2.8) days, p = 0.03]. the number of patients showing a response was clearly higher (p < 0.0001) in the ecn group (52/55; 94.5%) than in the placebo group (39/58; 67.2%). patients receiving sf 68 had a reduced duration of diarrhea compared with placebo, with a highly statistically significant difference between treatments. mean duration of diarrhea was decreased (p = 0.034) with l. acidophilus lb (43.4 hours) versus placebo (57.0 hours). interferon- gamma and il-12 were mildly elevated in the probiotics group, compared with the placebo group. on the second day of treatment only 26% of patients receiving l. reuteri had watery diarrhea, compared with 81% of those receiving placebo (p =

7 [5%] vs 27 [18%], p < 0.002), although differences between the groups in less severe morbidity were not significant. cmc babies died during the study (p<0.05 and ci of 95 per cent.) no significant differences were observed in weight accretion or linear growth. the results showed no difference between groups on the parental stress scale (nicu) or the parental expectations survey. infants in the stsc group had better mean weekly increase in head circumference (1.0 cm (sd = 0.3) vs. 0.7 cm (sd = 0.3);

observed on all 8 scales (all p < 0.01 or p < 0.001). topiramate appears to be a safe and effective agent in the treatment of anger in women with borderline personality disorder as defined by scid criteria. significant drug-placebo differences were found, regardless of diagnosis, on "illusions," "ideas of reference," "psychoticism," "obsessive-compulsive symptoms," and "phobic anxiety," but not on "depression." time-by-group interaction effects revealed no significant group differences in scores from pre-treatment to posttreatment on any measure. weight gain was modest in the olanzapine-treated group but was significantly higher than in those treated with placebo (p < .02). there was significant improvement from baseline in both global measures (cgi-i and gas) following divalproex sodium treatment. significant changes on four staxi scales (state anger, p < .01; trait anger, p < .05; anger out, p < .01; anger control, p < .01) were observed in the subjects treated with topiramate. haloperidol (4-16 mg/day) produced significant improvement over placebo in global functioning, depression, hostility, schizotypal symptoms, and impulsive behavior. olanzapine was associated with a statistically significant improvement over placebo in depression, anxiety, and impulsivity/aggressive behavior. primary outcome measures were changes on the interpersonal sensitivity, anger/hostility, and depression scales of the symptom checklist 90 (scl-90) as well as the total score of the modified overt aggression scale (moas). however, olanzapine monotherapy and ofc seem to be superior to fluoxetine monotherapy in treating both of these dimensions of borderline psychopathology. primary outcome measures were changes in scores on the symptom checklist (scl-90-r), the hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d), the hamilton anxiety rating scale (ham-a), and the state-trait anger expression inventory and were assessed weekly. this decrease was independent of changes in depression. the only exception (p < 0.05) was found on the anger-in scale, where a difference of only 8.5% (p < 0.2) was found. fluvoxamine but not placebo produced a robust and long-lasting reduction in the scores on the subscale for rapid mood shifts. analyses that used random-effects regression modeling and controlled for baseline severity showed e-epa to be superior to placebo in diminishing aggression as well as the severity of depressive symptoms. a secondary finding was that patients in the lamotrigine group had significantly greater reductions in scores on the zan-bpd impulsivity item (p = 0.001). at 12 weeks, the n-3 efa group had significantly greater improvements in scores for depression, suicidality and daily stresses. analysis of variance indicated no statistically significant differences between ziprasidone and placebo in the cgi-bpd. no significant positive effects of the drug were found. olanzapine was found to be significantly (p <.05) superior to placebo on the cgi- three-way comparisons between groups indicated superior efficacy for phenelzine, followed by placebo and haloperidol on measures of depression, borderline

prompt in group b. follicle cysts were diagnosed in 19% and 16% of groups a and b, respectively; their appearance and regression were significantly more rapid in group b cycles. there were significantly more follicles (p = 0.0001), oocytes (p = 0.0008), fertilized oocytes (p = 0.0001), and cleaved embryos (p = 0.0001), and a higher fertilization rate (p = 0.0047) in patients in group 1. the cleavage rate of mature oocytes was higher in the short protocol (70% versus 56% p less than 0.01). the pregnancy rate per cycle or per patient in the group with a short-term gnrh-agonist regimen is significantly higher compared to that of the group using the conventional hmg treatment. no elevation of plasma lh occurred in either group. inhibition of the endogenous luteinizing hormone using triptorelin improved the results of in vitro fertilization in group ii and group iii women, but the short regimen was distinctly less compelling and less expensive than the long regimen. the pregnancy rates per first treatment cycle, treatment cycle, oocyte retrieval, and et were significantly higher when buserelin acetate was started in the midluteal phase. the fertilization rates, number of embryos transferred, and pregnancy rates were also similar in both groups. a modified long "mini-dose" protocol appears to be superior to a modified mega-dose flare protocol in terms of oocyte yield and cycle outcome. the number of follicles greater than 17 mm and the peak estradiol level were significantly (p < .05) higher in the long protocol than those in the short protocol. patients in group ii had significantly higher serum luteinizing hormone, progesterone, and testosterone levels during stimulation with human menopausal gonadotropins (hmg) before oocyte retrieval (p < 0.05). no significant differences found between day 1 and day 21 initiation. mean follicular phase serum luteinizing hormone (lh) and progesterone (p) levels were significantly lower in group i than in group ii (p less than 0.01). the short-term regimen did not improve the follicular recruitment, and appeared to reduce the oocytes fertilization rate and embryo quality when compared with prolonged administration of peptide. a significantly higher number of mature oocytes were obtained in the study group (stop protocol) compared to the control group (non-stop protocol) (8.7 +/- 0.9 versus 6.2 +/- detections of free alpha subunit and dimeric lh were performed by highly specific 'two site' monoclonal immunoradiometric assays. patients in group 1 showed a significant decrease (p less than 0.05) in the number and size of follicles developed in comparison to groups 2 and 3. a reduced dose of triptorelin is enough for pituitary suppression during ovarian stimulation but provides no significant improvement in ivf cycle outcome when compared with depot formulation. there was a significant difference in the number of embryos cleaved and transferred among the groups, but there were no significant differences in the cancellation rate, mean number of oocytes collected or fertilized, and number of cases of failed fertilization. a significantly higher cancellation rate was noted in the study group than in the controls (22.5% versus 5%, respectively). however, this did not translate into higher serum concentrations of androstenedione and e2 and had no significant effect on ovarian response and the outcome of ivf/intracytoplasmic sperm injection.|fifty four women with repeated unsuccessful in vitro fertilization (ivf) cycles due to inadequate ovarian response to

specificity of 68.7%, and ppv of 52.3%. specificity was 44.9% in women less than 30 of age and 64.4% in women more than 30 of age. the sensitivities of hc2 and fish for cin 2+ were not significantly different (100% vs. 90%, p = 0.25), while the specificity of hc2 was significantly lower than that of fish (28% vs. 48%, p=0.003). the abbott realtime hr hpv showed similar clinical performance for detection of cin2+ when compared with hc2, for both the overall population and those with a cytological grade of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us). the specificity of p16 cytology for hgcin detection was significantly higher than for hpv testing for cytotechnologists and pathologists: 63.2% to 71.1% (p16 cytology) vs 37.8% for hpv in asc-us (p < .001) and 37.3% to 53.3% (p16 cytology) vs 18.5% for hpv in lsil (p < .001). the sensitivity of a positive high-risk hpv test for cin 2/3 at the first visit was 96.3%, the specificity 60.2%, the positive predictive value 20.6%, and the negative predictive value 99.3%. the sensitivity of this test for high grade-sil or higher was 90.2% and the negative predictive value was 96.5% (odds ratio=18.9; 95% confidence interval, 10.9-33.1). hpv infection was diagnosed in 11.2% of afr and 38.0% of asc-us (p=0.00003); high-risk hpv types (namely, hpv-16, -18, -31, -66, -67 and -70) were found in 6.7% of afr and 22.8% of asc-us (p=0.00239). for women with histologic hsil+, the hpv test was positive in 89.2% (95% confidence interval [ci], 78.4%-95.2%), and the specificity was 64.1 % (95% ci, 60.9%-67.2%). differences in specificities were also observed: 82.4% (81.8%-83.1%) for thin-layer pap (with a result of > or = ascus), 78.8% (77.9%-79.7%) for pcr, and 72.6% (69.4%-75.0%) for signal amplification. the rates of detection of hpv dna and of e6 and e7 transcripts were 33.3% and 25%, respectively, for specimens with normal findings; 51.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for specimens with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 (cin1); and 61.1% and 44.2% for specimens with cin2, respectively. sensitivities of hybrid capture ii for detecting cin and high-grade cin (0.81 and 0.86, respectively) were similar to those of cytology (0.83 and 0.82, respectively) and pcr (0.77 and 0.95, respectively), and higher than those of southern blot hybridization (0.48 and 0.45, respectively). human papillomavirus-negative women with asc-h cytology were at a reduced but significant risk of cin2 or more severe (cin2+) (10.6%) compared with hpv-positive women with asc-h cytology. proex c staining is a more sensitive and specific biomarker for detecting cervical disease than adjunct testing for hr-hpv status in papanicolaou tests with asc-us. testing for high-risk hpv with the hct ii test is useful in the detection of cin 2/3 in lsil groups and in the selection of patients for colposcopy in ascus groups, but it is not suitable for cervical cancer screening tests. high-risk hpv types were detected in 31.3% of all subjects, 36.4% of those with cin 1, and 93.3% of those with cin 2-3. hpv test showed the best performance; overall, it had the highest sensitivity (92.3%), specificity (78.6%) and ppv (14.9%). the area under the receiver operating characteristic (roc) curve was significantly less among women aged 25-34 years than in those older, both considering ascus/agus (atypical glandular cells of undetermined significance) (p=0.0355) and lsil (p=0.0009). hc ii was also more often positive in women with negative colposcopic evaluations (29% [25.7-32.4%] vs. 20% [17.6-23.5%], p < .005). the la test has higher hpv-positive rates than hc ii for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia i (83.3% vs 61.1%; p < 0.01) and for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia ii and more severe lesions (100.0% vs 80.0%; p < 0.01). adding a high-risk hpv test in secondary screening increased the identification of women with cin2-3 lesions by 33% in comparison with repeat cytology (p=0.01). the sensitivity of the second pap smear and hpv-dna test to detect cin 2-3 was 61 (95% ci = 45-74) and 82% (95% ci = 67-91), respectively. sensitivity to detect cin3 or above by testing for cancer-associated hpv dna was 96.3% (95% confidence interval [ci] = 91.6% to 98.8%), with 56.1% of women referred to colposcopy. hpv testing of cervical smears is more sensitive but less specific than cytology for detecting high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin2+). they showed significant differences (p < 0.001) between negative p16 expressions of pap smears with the presence of reactive lesions in follow-up biopsies and hr-hpv viral load. for lsil, the sensitivity was 75% (3 of 4 specimens) for p16(ink4a) and 100% (4 of 4 specimens) for hc2. the hpv dna triage showed a good accuracy (specificity over 94%, sensitivity of 37% and ppv for cin2+ lesions around 30%). the surepath, inform hpv, and hc2 correctly identified high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (hsils) in 15 (94%) of 16, 6 (38%) of 16, and 14 (93%) of 15 cases, respectively. genotyping of discordant results showed a prevalence of lr-hpv types in hc2 positive/amplicor negative samples, and a similar prevalence of hr- and lr-hpv types in amplicor positive/hc2 negative samples. hybrid capture ii positive rates were 93.3% for cases with cin iii, 72.2% for cin ii, and 51.0% for cin i (p <.001). age did not appear to be a factor in determining which cases went on to manifest high-grade disease within 3 years of a low-grade result (p=0.678). for women with ascus, hpv testing was highly sensitive for detecting cin3 and cancer with dramatically fewer referrals of older women. compared with hpv dna testing, which detected 87.5% (7/8) of the cases of cin 2 or 3, repeat pap smear showing high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (hsil) detected 11.1% (1/9) of cases (p = 0.004), and repeat pap smear showing ascus, lsil or hsil detected 55.6% (5/9) (p = 0.16). the sensitivity and specificity of the repeat pap smear alone for the detection of cin 2/3 were 73.7% and 62.9%, respectively, when referring all women with a repeat pap smear using an ascus-positive threshold. high-risk group hpv detection can be used as an additional triage test to detect hsils in women having asc-us with high sensitivity and negative predictive value. two abnormal quadrants (90% vs.

patients. subjects with variable cd4+ t-cell percentages tended to have higher pre-haart plasma hiv-1 rna set-points and experienced higher levels of plasma hiv-1 rna rebound during sti. major hiv drug-resistance mutations were not induced through cd4 cell count-guided treatment interruptions in hiv-infected patients successfully treated with haart after dual-nrti therapy. a rebound in plasma viral load was detected in all patients from day 3 to day 31 with a mean doubling time of 2.01 (se 0.29) days. the adverse events were not significantly different among arms (p=.27). hiv-specific cd8+ t cells increased between week 0 (median, 343 spot-forming cells per million peripheral blood lymphocytes [sfc/106 pbl]) and week 52 (median, 1930 sfc/106 pbl), but there was an inverse correlation between response and the number of spot-forming cells. also, secondary analysis showed no difference between the two strategies in terms of safety, retention of immune reconstitution, and clinical therapy failure. long term treatment will increase the frequency of: i) drug-related side effects; ii) onset of drug-resistant viral strains; iii) non-adherence of the patients to the treatment. consistent with a loss of phenotypic susceptibility to lamivudine, the m184v mutation was detected by genotypic analysis (direct and clonal sequencing) in plasma samples collected from two patients at the end of the second or third sti. in these patients, there was no evidence of mutations suggestive of drug resistance, and plasma saquinavir levels were within the expected range. the plasma viral load (pvl) noted after > or =2 years without antiretroviral therapy remained significantly lower than the pvl noted before initiation of haart, for 11 of the 26 patients (i.e., for 18% of the 60 patients who had sti performed). there were no significant changes in glucose or insulin levels or in anthropometric measurements. t cell counts, no significant increase in cd4(+) or cd8(+) t cells expressing activation markers or producing ifn-gamma in response to hiv, no increase in cd4(+) although some disturbances appear at the resumption of therapy, no definitive problems are found that preclude such therapeutic approaches from a psychological perspective. (iv) the increase in hiv-specific cd8(+) t lymphocyte frequencies induced by sti was not correlated with decreased viral set point after sti; and (v) hiv-specific cd4(+) kinetic studies demonstrated that viruses expressing resistance mutations could be detected for >5 months after the discontinuation of treatment in some patients. patients with lower cd4 cell counts at therapy initiation were more likely to resume therapy than were those with counts of >500 cells/mm3 (<200 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 4.4]; and 200-350 cells/mm3 [relative hazard, 2.9]). in contrast, group b patients showed no significant changes in immunological parameters during a prolonged drug-free period. l was not statistically different from the control group. during the first cycle, plasma hiv rna increased to > 50 copies/ml (range, 67-88) in five patients at day 4, in eight patients (> 100 copies/ml) at day 8 and in 12 patients (> 100 copies/ml) at day 14. those subjects who controlled viral replication developed significantly stronger hiv-1 specific cellular immune responses than subjects lacking spontaneous decline (p < 0.05). in 14 of 25 and in 3 of 25 subjects, the m184v and the l90m mutations, respectively, were detected as minor populations, at different times during sti. the duration of the first interruption and the reduction of time on therapy were related to nadir cd4+ cell count. cd4 nadir was a significant predictor for treatment reinitiation in a multivariate analysis. cd4 lprs to p24 increased significantly (p = 0.001) between day 0 of the first sti cycle and 4th sti but decreased thereafter. no significant differences were observed between haart and hu groups in na, ctl and lpr at any time-point. at enrolment, hiv-infected patients showed significantly higher serum concentrations of il-16 and rantes, and significantly lower concentrations of mcp-1, than did healthy controls. t cell counts, and showed no enhancement of antiviral cd8(+) although numbers of ctls did increase over the same time that viral rebounds decreased, there was no correlation between ctl count and either viral rebound rates or clearance rates. sti in chronically hiv-1-infected patients is not associated with reductions in cd4 t lymphocytes or to clinical complications in this group of patients after 2 years of effective plasma viral suppression. after haart resumption and consequent inhibition of hiv replication, vgamma9vdelta2 t cell reactivity was restored both quantitatively and functionally. four out of 7 patients in the haart group failed to control hiv by week 6 and had to restart therapy due to either viremia rebound or cd4 decrease. in 10/12 interrupter patients a rebound of hiv-1 rna was detected in all three structured treatment interruptions (sti).|hiv-infected

(intention-to-treat analysis). cure rates of h. pylori infection were 91% in the omeprazole plus amoxicillin group, 0% in the omeprazole plus placebo group, and 89% and 0%, respectively, performing an intention-to-treat analysis. the ulcer healing rate was 100% [95% confidence interval (ci), 95-100%] in h. pylori-negative and 83% (95% ci, 67-94%) in h. pylori-positive patients (p<0.01). duodenal ulcers were found in four (5%) the combination of rbc plus amoxicillin resulted in higher h. pylori cure rates (55%) and higher duodenal ulcer healing (74%) than did either treatment alone. the coprescription regimens gave significantly higher observed h. pylori eradication rates (82% and 74% for rbc400 + clar and rbc800 + clar) compared with rbc400 (0%; p < .001). cumulative relapse rates at 12 months were 12% (two of 17) in patients in whom h pylori had been eradicated and 100% (10 of 10) in those with persistent infection after short term therapy (p < 0.05). the healing quality of ulcer in group b was superior to that in groups c and a (p<0.05). eradication rates pp were oac 83% (95% ci: 68-93%), omc 93% (95% ci: 80-98%) and o 3% (95% ci: 0-13%). fifty percent of patients who received ranitidine alone for healing of duodenal or gastric ulcer had a relapse within 12 weeks of healing. no recurrence was noted in the duodenal ulcer patients and only 4% of gastric ulcers recurred after successful eradication during follow-up for 5 years. the cumulative rate of recurrence was significantly higher in group i than in group ii (90 vs 30% at 12 months, p < 0.01). on bismuth, only one patient became helicobacter pylori-negative (8.33%, p < 0.0001), but ulcers healed in 8/12 patients (67%, p = ns). the eradication rates of h. pylori in the full analysis set were 0% in group a-lpz-only, 87.5% in group b-lac200 and 89.2% in group c-lac400 for gastric ulcer and, 4.4% in group a-lpz-only, 91.1% in group b-lac200 and 83.7% in group c-lac400 for duodenal ulcer. among the dual therapies, higher eradication rates occurred when lansoprazole (with amoxicillin) or clarithromycin (with lansoprazole) was administered t.i.d. the recurrence rates of duodenal ulcers confirmed by endoscopy in these three groups were 64%, 33% and 0% at the third month, and 73%, 67% and 5% at the sixth month, respectively. the three schemes of treatment were effective for ulcerous healing with 70.5%, 82.3%, and 78.2%, respectively, without significant differences. omeprazole plus clarithromycin dual therapy eradicated h. pylori in 83% of patients with duodenal ulcer and significantly decreased 12-month recurrence from 76% to 6%. the prevalence of h. pylori was 82% and the eradication rate 88% in the omc group and 3% in the op group. h. pylori recurred in 13 patients and the reinfection rate was 44.8% over two years. among the 52 patients given antibiotics, h. pylori was eradicated in 46, as compared with 1 of the 52 given placebo (89 percent vs. 2 percent, p < 0.001). the co-prescription regimens gave high h pylori eradication rates determined using two tests (clotest and 13c-urea breath test) for the presence of the organism. hp eradication was achieved in 82% of the ome + amx group, but in 0% of the ome group. on an intention-to-treat basis, omeprazole/amoxicillin led to cure of h. pylori infection in 67.1% (47 of 70) of patients not using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids)/aspirin (asa) and in 46.7% (14 of 30) of those taking nsaids/asa (p < 0.05). h. pylori eradication occurred in 0% of the cimetidine group and in 73.7% of the double-therapy group (p = 0.004). the ulcer healing rate was 90.2% (95% confidence interval (95% ci): 79-97%) in the omeprazole group at 6 weeks as compared to 83.3% (95% ci: 70-93%) in the triple therapy group (p = 0.38). at five weeks, h. pylori had been eradicated in 41 of the 45 patients in the antibacterial-treatment group (91.1 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 82.9 to 99.3) and in 5 of the 40 in the omeprazole group (12.5 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2.3 to 22.7; p < 0.001). rapid, complete, and persistent suppression of gastroduodenitis activity and gastric surface epithelium lesions was observed in most hp-eradicated group there was no duodenal ulcer recurrence in 43 h. pylori-negative/cured patients (0%), which was significantly different in terms of duodenal ulcer recurrence (p=0.001). the relapse rate at the 3rd month was 11.7% (2/17) in the triple therapy group and 60% (6/10) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.0248). clarithromycin and omeprazole dual therapy is simple and well-tolerated and leads to consistently high eradication rates for patients with duodenal ulcer associated with h. pylori infection. treatment with an antibiotic only regimen was effective for the healing of duodenal ulcer, and clearance as well as eradication of h pylori contributed significantly to the healing. eradication of h. pylori was significantly better with lansoprazole with triple therapy than with either lansoprazole with amoxycillin or lansoprazole alone (90% vs. 55% vs. 3%, respectively). h. pylori eradication rates as diagnosed by culture, histology, urease test, and [13c]urea breath test 4 weeks after stopping therapy were 0, 0, 8, 45, 6, 46, and 62%, respectively, in groups i-vii. triple therapy eradicated h. pylori in 51 patients [intention-to-treat, 84%; 95% confidence interval (ci), 75-93%]. the differences in the eradication and relapse rates between o vs. omc and o vs. oac were statistically significant (all, p < 0.001). reinfection rates at 6 months were 42.1% and 15.1% in groups b and c, respectively (p < .05). during a 12-month follow-up gastric ulcer relapsed in 20/32 (63%) of the persistently helicobacter pylori positive patients. gastric ulcer relapse was observed in 49% of patients who were h. pylori positive and in 2% who were h. pylori negative after treatment. the difference (higher relapse rate for omeprazole-treated patients) was significant (p < 0.001) by the second evaluation, 4 months after treatment. histopathological results showed statistically significant differences (p < 0.05) between eradicated and non eradicated patients in terms of severity of inflammation and intestinal metaplasia, but not in terms of atrophy. combined therapy with anti-h. pylori agents and ranitidine was superior to ranitidine alone for duodenal ulcer healing. eleven patients in the triple therapy group suffered from adverse effects (45.8%) (p < 0.05 as compared with other groups). the cure rate for h. pylori infection was 4.2% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 38.5% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.01) for gastric ulcers, and 0% in patients receiving lansoprazole alone and 61.9% in patients receiving lansoprazole plus amoxycillin (p < 0.001) for duodenal ulcers. the minimal inhibitory concentration of lansoprazole for h. pylori in vitro is lower than that for omeprazole, prompting interest in treatment with amoxicillin plus lansoprazole. in the omeprazole/amoxycillin group 93% (67/72; 95% confidence interval 84% to 98%) of gastric ulcers healed and 83% (29/35; 66% to 94%) in the omeprazole group (p = 0.103). however, the overall failure rate (absence of healing, relapse) was lower (p = 0.04, log-rank test) in the antibiotic group in which all relapses but one were observed in h. pylori positive patients. triple therapy had a similarly high healing rate to h2-blocker therapy (100% vs 90.5%) at two months of follow-up.|forty-two

p <.0016, log-rank test) and 2-fold for ab(2) responders (18.3 months) versus nonresponders (9.3 months). c-mov18 did not have a mitogenic effect on patients' pbmc and adding il-2 did not change the degree of proliferation. specific hla-dp4-restricted cd4+ t cell responses were elicited after vaccination with ny-eso-1(157-170) peptide (emulsified in ifa) in patients with ny-eso-1-expressing epithelial ovarian cancer. the generation of ca125-specific b and t cell responses after mab-b43.13 injection correlated with improved survival. ab3-positive patients showed a significantly longer survival (median, 23.4 months; p < 0.0001) as compared with ab3-negative patients (median, 4.9 months). ab3 was detectable in all patients (median, 236,794 ng/ml); none of route of administration (p=0.6268), dose (p=0.4602), or cohort (p=0.4944) was statistically significant in terms of effect on maximum post-baseline ab3 titer. the network structure of the immune system implicates the possibility of a selective immunization by the activation of idiotypic cascades. in 5 of 10 patients, peptide-specific cytotoxic t lymphocytes (ctls) could be detected in the peripheral blood using both intracellular ifn-gamma staining and (51)cr-release assays. there were no grade 3/grade 4 adverse events. elisa for anti-idiotypic antibodies (ab2) showed significant levels in patients who completed the protocol. in 5 of 9 patients, tumor reactive cd4+/cd8+ t-lymphocytes increased significantly, indicating specific anti-tumor immunity. eleven of the 26 patients tested had evidence of an anti-stn th1 antigen-specific t-cell response as determined by interferon-gamma, but not interleukin (il)-4, production. all four high-dose and four of six low-dose patients developed moderate to strong dth reactions at the vaccination sites. there were no differences between the groups with regard to induction of human anti-mouse antibody (p = 0.1006). cd8 t-cell responses were detected in 1 participant ex vivo and in 8 of 9 participants (89%) after in vitro stimulation. grade 3 to 4 toxicity was reported in 24.6% of patients in the placebo group and 20.1% of patients in the oregovomab group, respectively. significant increases in t-cell responses were measured in 7/18 (39%) patients in response to ca125, in 5/8 (63%) patients in response to autologous tumor and in 9/18 (50%) patients in response to oregovomab.|patients with pc.9 patients with progressive pc from gastric (n = 6) and ovarian cancer (n = 2), and cancer of unknown primary (n = 1) received metastatic adenocarcinoma patients undergoing active specific immunotherapy with synthetic stn vaccine thirty-three patients were available for ab3 analysis (removed for progression of disease, 6;

salmeterol than in the fluticasone propionate group, the mean increase in morning pef being 19 l/min higher (95% ci 11.0 to 26.1) and in evening pef being 16 l/min (95% ci 18.4 to 24.0) higher in the salmeterol group. significant differences in the urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio between treatment groups at 12 weeks (p=0.001) indicated suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the patients on beclomethasone 1000 microg twice daily. combined salmeterol fluticasone therapy resulted in significantly greater improvements in pefr and symptom control than doubling the dose of fp. both the salm 50 and salm 100 groups had a significantly increased percentage of symptom-free and rescue-free days and nights compared with the bdp 1,000 group, and there was no difference between the two salmeterol groups. the overall mean morning premedication pef for the entire treatment period was higher in the formotero/bdp group (p=0.002). the hazard ratio for both comparisons was 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 2.6; p=0.03). there were no significant differences between treatment groups in the number of patients with abnormal response to corticotropin stimulation at treatment week 24. compared with taa, 600 microg bid, treatment with fp 220, microg bid, significantly increased fev1, morning and evening pef, and percent symptom-free days, and significantly reduced rescue albuterol use, number of nighttime awakenings, and overall asthma symptom scores (p < or = 0.035). the increase in mean morning pef-the primary efficacy measure-was significantly higher for budesonide/formoterol compared with budesonide alone (16.5 l/min vs 7.3 l/min, p = 0.002). no significant differences between groups were found in fev1, pd20 methacholine, symptom scores, and exacerbation rates after 1 yr. salmeterol added to low-dose beclomethasone was superior (p < or = 0.05) to doubling the dose of beclomethasone in improving peak expiratory flow (pef) and forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (fev1), and in reducing symptoms of asthma, sleep loss, nighttime awakenings, and use of albuterol. no significant changes in the proportion of eosinophils, eg2(+) cells, other inflammatory cells, or ecp levels in sputum were observed over the ensuing 1-yr treatment with bud200+f or bud800. this was accompanied by a significant improvement in peak expiratory flow in the fp400 + salm group in both the morning and evening compared to the fp1000 group. over weeks 1 to 24, morning peak expiratory flow was increased by 47 l/min from baseline with salmeterol treatment as compared with 24 l/min with fp 220 microg twice daily (p < .001) while the percent of symptom-free days increased from baseline by 26% of days as compared with 10% of days (p < .001). there were significant differences in favour of salmeterol/bdp in diurnal variation of pef (all time points) and in use of rescue bronchodilator (salbutamol) and daytime and night-time symptoms (some time points). sm/fp250 also resulted in more symptom-free days and nights (p < 0.002) and days and nights with no relief medication (p < 0.001). in group a, budesonide alone reduced the risk for severe exacerbations by 60% and poorly controlled days by 48%; adding formoterol increased lung function with no change in other end points. patients treated with salmeterol combined with fluticasone propionate had improvements over baseline in fev at endpoint that were at least twice as great (0.6 to 0.7 l) as improvements in patients treated with salmeterol (0.3 l) or fluticasone propionate alone (0.3 l) (p < .05). after high-dose inhaled corticosteroid, stepping down with the combination inhaler conferred further improvements in bronchoprotection, bronchodilatation, and clinical control, but not inflammatory markers, compared with that seen with a medium dose of inhaled corticosteroid. significantly greater increases in morning pef, the primary efficacy variable, were observed in patients treated with budesonide/formoterol compared with fluticasone propionate (27.4 l/min vs 7.7 l/min; p < 0.001). secondary efficacy measures included fev1, morning peak expiratory flow, percent of symptom-free days, and daily albuterol use. secondary efficacy endpoints also showed fsc 100/50 microg twice daily to be more effective than fp 250 microg twice daily alone. sfc also provided significantly better control of daytime symptoms and a significantly greater reduction in the requirement for rescue salbutamol compared with budesonide. quality of life improved with both treatments, but without significant statistical differences between the groups. high-dose budesonide had the broadest range of beneficial effects on other outcomes, including symptom scores, morning peak expiratory flow and forced expiratory volume in one second. after treatment with salmeterol there was no deterioration of airway inflammation as assessed by mast cells, lymphocytes, or macrophages in bal or biopsies, but rather a significant fall in eg1-positive eosinophils in the lamina propria (from a median 18.3 to 7.6 cells/mm, p = 0.01), which was not seen after treatment with

treatment groups, with the preparation containing 20 micrograms ethinyl estradiol and that containing 400 micrograms norethisterone acetate being associated with higher discontinuation rates due to bleeding disturbances. most mean changes from baseline laboratory values were comparable between groups, although the mean increase in cholesterol concentration was statistically significantly lower in the levonorgestrel with ethinyl estradiol group. the median values for the fasting levels of insulin, c-peptide and free fatty acids slightly increased or remained unchanged while the fasting glucose levels slightly decreased after 13 treatment cycles. both study treatments were safe and well tolerated by the volunteers as shown by the nature and frequency of adverse events, the routine laboratory examinations, and the physical and gynecological examinations. withdrawal bleeding characteristics were comparable between the two groups, except for the length of the latent period, which was significantly longer in the lng/ee group. despite the small sample size, the main finding in the trial is clear-cut; loestrin-20 provides poor cycle control and is thus less acceptable as an oral contraceptive than microgynon-30. the changes in the hemostatic variables for drsp/20ee were less pronounced compared to dsg/30ee and drsp/30ee. breakthrough bleeding and spotting was reported by a significantly lower percentage of participants in the ortho tri-cyclen lo group compared with the loestrin fe 1/20 group. irregular bleeding (break-through bleeding or spotting) was significantly more frequent with the 150/20 combination in about two-thirds of the cycles randomly distributed over the one year of the study. from the study, it was demonstrated that the two regimens had no difference in cycle control, efficacy, and side effects. there was also an increase in the threshold of fibrinolytic inhibition (ratio pai-1) in both groups, which was less pronounced in the 20 micrograms ee group. a total of 1,850 cycles were completed and analyzed for efficacy, side effects, metabolic changes, and cycle control. analysis of results revealed that there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups with regard to the plasma levels of hdl-cholesterol and its subfractions, ldl-cholesterol and apolipoproteins. bloating, breast tenderness, and nausea were approximately 50% more common in women using 35 micrograms ee as compared to 20 micrograms ee preparations. no clinically significant differences were noted in weight, blood pressure, papanicolaou

internal fixation duration of the operation and the perioperative blood loss marked osteopenia|after the operation, the fracture patients had a lower harris score than the arthrosis patients, and this was most pronounced among those who had undergone osteosynthesis. arthroplasty is more clinically effective and cost-effective than reduction and fixation in healthy older patients with a displaced intracapsular fracture of the hip. there were no postoperative deaths and no significant differences in hospital stay. internal fixation proved to be a less time-consuming operation, gave a shorter hospitalization time and was associated with a significantly reduced morbidity rate compared with prosthetic replacement. there was a trend towards decreased mobility in the hemiarthroplasty group (p = 0.066). there are no randomised trials comparing internal fixation and hemiarthroplasty for a displaced intracapsular femoral neck fracture in relation to mental state. no difference could be demonstrated in the mortality rates, fracture- or operation-related complications or the need for secondary intervention. hip function was significantly better in the thr group at all follow-up reviews regarding pain (p < 0.005), movement (p < 0.05 except at 4 months) and walking (p < 0.05). hemiarthroplasty is associated with better functional outcome than internal fixation in treatment of displaced fractures of the femoral neck in elderly patients. we decided to study whether internal fixation would prove superior to hemiarthroplasty even in displaced femoral neck fractures in patients over 75 years old. the range of passive hip motion in the three groups of patients did not differ significantly (p>0.05). after two years the rate of failure was 43% in the internal fixation (if) and 6% in the arthroplasty group (p < 0.001). the mean patient survival was significantly higher in the group undergoing reduction and internal fixation (79 months) compared with that with a cemented thompson hemiarthroplasty or a cemented monk bipolar hemiarthroplasty (61 months and 68 months, respectively). despite high early complications, tha resulted in least pain and most mobility both in the short and long-term and was encouraging with a revision rate of only 6.25%. for the survivors assessed at one, two and three years from injury there were no differences with regard to the outcome

24-hour systemic antibiotic prophylaxis adverse ecological effects deep infection significant wound sepsis incisional wound infections|patients in the cefazolin and metronidazole group had a significantly higher number of postoperative urinary tract and respiratory tract infections than the other two groups combined (p less than 0.01). there was no difference between the groups in deep sepsis or anastomotic leak rates (sulbactam, four patients; cefoxitin, seven patients). deep wound infection or dehiscence was seen in 12 of 105 having both administrations of antibiotics, and in nine of 98 having only intravenous antibiotics. the postoperative wound infection rate was significantly lower in group i patients than group ii 5.6% (6/107) and 18.4% (21/ 114), respectively (p < 0.01). wound infection occurred in 15 patients (9.1%) and deep surgical infection in 4 (2.4%). no differences were found in the two groups between frequencies of anastomotic dehiscences, intra-abdominal abscesses, sepsis, and pulmonary infections. the prophylactic regimen significantly reduced the number of urinary tract infections (p less than or equal to 0.0001). it is concluded that there is no statistically significant difference on the incidence of postoperative wound sepsis in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery between the group given doxycycline for five days and the group given netilmicin plus metronidazole for one day. the abdominal wound infection rate was 11.2 percent in group a and 9.1 percent in group b (difference not significant). post-operative peritonitis was not seen. doxycycline thus was significantly more effective in preventing complications in general, but metronidazole gave superior protection against anaerobes. non-wound infectious morbidity was 5.8% (p greater than 0.05) for cefoperazone, mostly urinary tract infections causes by escherichia coli, streptococcus faecalis, and staphylococcus spp. both regimens were acceptable with minimal toxicity. there was a low incidence (1.3%) of serious postoperative bleeding and no serious adverse reactions were noted. abdominal pain was recorded in 13%, 10% and 4% of patients (p: 0.077). there were no wound infections in the 34 patients receiving cefamandole and only one wound infection (2.8 percent) in the 36 control patients. patients who received oral antibiotics alone (group a) had significantly higher risks of postoperative sepsis when compared with patients in either group b or group c no difference in wound infection rates was seen in patients following appendicectomy, biliary or gastro-oesophageal surgery. a significantly lower incidence of abdominal wound sepsis, intra-abdominal complications and septicaemia was found in the doxycycline group (12.4%) compared to the controls (45%). besides those, 26 infections of the urinary tract were observed, which occurred significantly more often after the one-shot dose (40.9%) than with the short-time prophylaxis (18.6%). surgical infections occurred in 92 (26.4 per cent) of 349 evaluable patients. infection rates stratified by types of surgery were similar for both regimens. there was no significant difference in the incidence of operation-related infection, chest or urinary tract infection. no significant difference was observed concerning local wound infection, septicemia, anastomotic dehiscence or death. perineal wound sepsis (31 per cent) was significantly more common than abdominal wound sepsis (7 per cent). there was no significant difference in wound infection rates between the two groups (14.7% for cefotetan and 13.9% for cefuroxime plus metronidazole), or the rates of other infective complications. there was no difference in the other outcome measures studied which included non-fatal deep sepsis, length of postoperative hospital stay, duration of postoperative fever or the use of antibiotics for postoperative infection. although wound infection rates were lower in the cefotetan group, the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess was similar in both groups. no significant differences were found in the incidence of other major or minor infective or non-infective postoperative complications between the groups. it is concluded that short-term prophylaxis with cefotaxime is as effective as long-term prophylaxis with penicillin and streptomycin. no significant intergroup difference was found between the respective overall rates of infectious complications (3.2% and 4.9%). wound infection was related to the amount of perioperative blood loss, duration of the operation, type of operation and drainage in the aminoglycoside group. a subset analysis of prolonged operations found significantly fewer superficial ssis in the single high dose group than in the multiple standard dose group with rates of 22.2% (6/27) vs. 55% (11/20), respectively (p= 0.021). this study demonstrated that a single-dose antibiotic regimen was as effective as a multiple-dose regimen in the prophylaxis of wound infections following abdominal surgery. the time of hospitalization was reduced from 20.3 days (cp) to 16.7 days (co) (p less than 0.05 s). septic complications remote from the abdominal wound, e.g. intra-abdominal abscesses, occurred in both cefoxitin-treated and placebo-treated patients, but numbers were too small for meaningful analysis. no septic complications occurred in the 26 patients (0%) receiving metronidazole/fosfomycin (p less than 0.01). no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 3.1 in group a (1/32) and 0% in group b. urinary tract infections (1 case) and respiratory tract infections (2 cases) were observed only in group b: the overall infection rate was 17 of 149 evaluable patients (11%), 95% ci 6.8 to 17.7. orthograde bowel lavage alone proved to be of no effect in reducing the rate of septic complications when used without antibiotic perioperative short-term-prophylaxis and therefore cannot be recommended to be used solely. patients receiving cefoxitin had a higher wound infection rate than patients receiving erythromycin-neomycin-cefazolin (12.5% v 3.2%, respectively, p = .06). five out of 36 evaluable patients had an infection at the operation site. because of an unacceptably high rate of surgical infection in all three groups (36%, 29% and 39%, p greater than 0.1) among the first 103 evaluable patients, the study was discontinued. thirty-four patients (10.9 per cent) developed abdominal wound infection, 17 patients (5.5 per cent) intra-abdominal abscess and 16 patients (5.1 per cent) anastomotic leakage. only one serious, but non-fatal intra-abdominal complication (1.4%) was observed in this group. no significant haematological or biochemical abnormalities were detected. wound infection rates, which included minor and delayed infections, were similar in both groups (group p, 57 of 342, 16.7 per cent; group t, 55 of 358, 15.4 per cent; 95 per cent confidence intervals for the difference being -4.1 to +6.7 per cent. nonobese patients and patients whose surgical procedures lasted less than 4 hours treated with either drug had significantly higher success rates (p less than 0.01). when the four surgical blocks were separately considered, however, the difference between the two regimens was found to be mainly due to rectal operations, following which the incidence of abdominal and of perineal wound infections was significantly lower with the combined regimen than with doxycycline alone. there were no significant differences between the groups for any of the outcome measures studied, the overall abdominal infection rates (wound, deep, and septicaemia) being 4.6% and 7.4%, and the remote infection rates (pneumonia, urinary tract, and central venous line) 15.1% and 12.8%, respectively. both groups were comparable in sex, age, clinical diagnosis and type of operation performed. the incidence of wound infection was significantly reduced (p less than 0.01) from 32% in the control group to 10% in the treated group. addition of cefuroxime reduced the 41.2 per cent infection rate to 8.3 per cent (p = 0.003). impairment of cell-mediated immunity was associated with significantly heightened rate of wound infection, and these patients did not benefit from topical antibiotics. in an open, prospective, and randomized investigation on the prophylactic efficacy of peroral neomycin sulfate-erythromycin base vs intravenous ceftriaxone-metronidazole preparation in colorectal surgery, no significantly diverging results between regimens were recorded (1/27 [3.7%] and 2/27 [7.4%] wound infections, respectively). wound infection rates were: group 1, 32/453 (7.1%; 95% confidence interval 4.7% to 9.4%); group 2, 33/454 (7.3%; 95% confidence interval 4.9% to 9.6%). the number of each type of septic postoperative complication and their total did not differ between the group treated by oral antibiotics prior to operation and the group treated peroperatively with systemic antibiotic therapy. there were two episodes of septicaemia, each in the mezlocillin group. the infection rate was 10% in the "one-dose" treatment group and 10% in the "four-dose" treatment group. wound infections occurred in 5 patients in the combined group but in 17 in the systemic group (p < 0.01, rr = 0.29, 95% ci 0.11-0.75). there was no advantage between any of the groups in the incidence of wound infection (3.9-6.8%). there was no statistically significant difference between both chemoprophylaxis groups (p = 0.10). a positive wound culture at the end of the operation was more common after colorectal surgery (30,2%) than after biliary surgery (4,6%) and was associated with a higher subsequent infection rate (p = 0,02). ignoring the treatment group, the median postoperative hospital stay was 17 days (interquartile range 10 days) for infected patients and 11 days (interquartile range 4 days) for those not infected.(abstract truncated at 250 words) two of 27 patients receiving cefoxitin developed wound infections, and one developed an intraabdominal abscess (11%). when trivial wound infections were disregarded the wound infection rates were 11% and 16% respectively, which again was not statistically significant. there was no statistical difference in the incidence of operation-related infection between the two groups. the rates of postoperative septicemia 3 vs. 4 percent and intra-abdominal abscess 5 vs. 8 percent were similar. the results show the effectiveness of the association gentamicin-metronidazole (9.4% of infections), compared to the control group with no antibiotics (39.1% of infections), x2 = 14.1; p less than 0.001). of the 128 evaluable patients, six of the 63 patients (9.5%) in the ampicillin/sulbactam group and seven of the 65 patients (10.7%) in the gentamicin and metronidazole group developed wound infection. intra-abdominal abscess occurred in 8% of those who received amoxycillin/clavulanate compared with 6% of those given metronidazole plus gentamicin. the wound infection rate was 10.6 percent in patients receiving timentin and 9.7 percent in those receiving mezlocillin (p greater than .05). the rates of infective complications were higher in the parenteral than in the combined group, the difference in wound infection rates being statistically significant; the figures were 27.6 percent and 13.9 percent, respectively (p = .04). analysis of the results showed that the two antibiotics had equivalent prophylactic effectiveness (congruent to 6%) in colorectal surgery. in the postoperative course 53% (group a) and 67% (group b) of the patients developed bacterial infections. the frequency of all wound infections (grade i + grade ii) was 8% in the treatment group (25 patients) versus 66.7% in the control group (24 patients). results in the two different groups were significantly different regarding abdominal abscess and the total infectious episodes in the surgical site with lower frequency in patients receiving both thymostimulin and the antibiotic (cefotetan). the overall incidence of intra-abdominal septic complications was 7.3% (7 of 96) in the control group (no cefoxitin) and 5% (5 of 101) in the treatment group (cefoxitin). the overall wound infection was 14.4%, with no difference between erythromycin and metronidazole. efficacy of prophylaxis in patients was evaluated in terms of appearance of post-surgical infections (abdominal, urinary, respiratory and wound infections). the results indicate that prophylactic cefotaxime and metronidazole are effective in reducing the incidence of septic complications following colorectal surgery; nevertheless, a study with a larger number of patients is needed to reach a definitive conclusion. a multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the risk of surgical site infection was influenced by the choice of the chemical bowel preparation (p = 0.03) and blood loss (p < 0.01), while an mrsa infection was predominantly influenced by blood loss (p < 0.01) followed by coexisting underlying diseases (p = 0.07). the difference in infection rates (2/41 = 5% v. 7/33 = 21%) was statistically significant. intra-abdominal abscesses (p less than 0.01) and anastomotic dehiscence (p less than 0.05) were also significantly reduced in group b patients. there were no significant differences in the infection rates between subgroups. episodes of sepsis, urinary tract infection and pneumonia were similar in both groups. wound sepsis was demonstrated in 11.5% of cases of group a and 23.0% of group b (p less than 0.01); another type of sepsis was observed in 34% of group a and 11.5% of group b (p less than 0.001). there were no significant differences between randomized groups on either preoperative tinidazole or placebo added to pre-, per, and postoperative doxycycline. the operative site infection rate was 6.5% for cefmetazole and 7.7% for cefoxitin (p greater than 0.05). no significant difference was noted in the incidence of wound infection, ie, 5.6% for the ceftriaxone group (95% confidence interval, 3.8% to 7.4%) and 6.9% for the cefamandole group (95% confidence interval, 4.9% to 8.9%). co-amoxiclav was given to 230 patients with a total wound infection rate of 5.6% and cefuroxime plus metronidazole were given to 225 patients with a total wound infection rate of 3%. there was no significant difference in the occurrence of postoperative sepsis between the two groups (a total of 72 patients). the reduction in the infection rate in the group treated by cefoxitin was statistically significant (p less than 0.02). the wound infection rate was 8% in those patients receiving ticarcillin prophylaxis and 20% in those receiving tinidazole (p less than 0.05). the rate of postoperative wound infections was not significantly different in the groups (p = 0,09). patients who received tinidazole and doxycycline had significantly fewer infectious complications, reoperations, additional use of antibiotics, and a shorter hospital stay. wound infection occurred in five of 81 patients who had topical application of ampicillin compared with six of 89 patients who did not receive prophylaxis; the difference was not significant. ertapenem is more effective than cefotetan in the prevention of surgical-site infection in patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery but may be associated with an increase in c. difficile infection. no significant difference in postoperative infections between the two groups could be demonstrated. no statistically significant between-treatment difference was detected in successful clinical response rates at the end of the study (72% for each group). other infections were least frequent in group c (four of 29 patients), but were not significantly different to groups b (six of 30) and a (nine of 31). when sub-groups were examined for total infections no significant difference was seen between antibiotic groups in patients undergoing clean/potentially contaminated operations or contaminated operations, although more deep infections were encountered in the amoxycillin/clavulanate group in comparison with the mezlocillin group, in contaminated operations. wound infection occurred in 1 case of group a versus 2 cases of group b (p greater than 0.25). antimicrobial prophylaxis was successful in preventing primary site infections in 92.8% of patients in the cefepime + metronidazole arm and 92.9% of patients in the ceftriaxone + metronidazole arm. patients with inflammatory bowel disease treated preoperatively with salicylazosulfapyridine run a greater risk of postoperative infection in spite of the prophylaxis. no significant differences were found in terms of the rate of surgical infections: 9% in group a and 16% in group b. infections not of surgical origin were found only in group b (10.4%). the resulting difference between the overall septic complication rate in patients receiving erythromycin, neomycin, and cefazolin (10.9 percent) and the rate in patients receiving metronidazole alone (31.9 percent) was significant. most infections occurred before the 10th postoperative day (8% failures at this time, estimated by the kaplan-meier method). no differences in overall postoperative morbidity were observed and neither group developed intra-abdominal, pelvic, or wound infections. although no serious infections were observed in either group, the incidence of superficial wound infections was relatively high: 19% in the group with metronidazole and gentamicin prophylaxis and 25% in the other group. in the cefotaxime group 22 of the 241 patients who had an anastomosis developed leaks (9%) compared with 8 of the 239 in the cefotaxime/metronidazole group (3%). the overall postoperative infection rate was 19.6% with no statistically significant difference between the two groups. the concentrations after administration of 2 g cefotiam were higher, as expected, and without any adverse side effects. the wound infection rate was 37% (10 patients) in group the proportion of patients with wound infections and other infective complications was significantly less (p < 0.02) in those receiving oral ciprofloxacin. the wound infection rate was 2.4 percent in the patients receiving timentin and 14 percent in those receiving tinidazole (p = 0.01). there was no significant difference in septic complication or mortality rates following short-term vs. long-term prophylaxis. no complications were observed from either the 10% mannitol solution or the intravenous flagyl at either clinical, hematologic, or biochemical assessment. the data obtained demonstrated that the reduced infection rate was not the result of a reduction in the bacterial content of the colon alone but due to the prophylactic agents used for elective colon surgery. monitoring of operative and postoperative bleeding revealed no evidence (except in one doubtful case) of excessive bleeding associated with the use of a single dose of latamoxef. among 224 evaluable cases, the timentin associated wound infection rate (0.7%), nonwound infectious morbidity (8.8%), adverse reactions (1.9%), and total costs ($14.15) were not statistically different than that of the control drug. the frequency of septic and nonseptic complications was not statistically significant different between the two regimens. two wound infections occurred in patients receiving e-m, neither due to anaerobic bacteria, but seven wound infections developed in patients given n-e (p = 0.057), five of them caused by anaerobic bacteria. no anaerobic pathogens were detected in any of the cases. most postoperative infections were superficial wound infections (14 of 24 patients), and the mean hospital stay in the two treatment groups was equal. bacteriologic examination of the anastomoses, abdominal walls, and wounds showed significantly more sterile cultures in the combination group, although more aerobic cefuroxime-resistant isolates were seen in this group. a significant excess of wound sepsis in the aztreonam group was seen (23/71 vs 9/70 chi 2 6.60; p less than 0.01). intra-abdominal infections were more frequent in the clindamycin + gentamicin arm of the study (fisher's exact test, p = 0.035).|patients ranged in age from 19 to 92 years (median 66 years); the majority were male (54.0%) and most (77.7%) had neoplastic disease 1002 patients randomly assigned to study

bio-chemically validated quit rate|however, counselling led to no differences in parental smoking between the two groups, or in exposure of the intervention and control children to tobacco smoke. in 1984, when the prevalence of cigarette smoking was 61% among men and 7% among women, approximately 250 million persons in prc smoked tobacco products (1). a brief intervention to advise parents of asthmatic children about the risks from passive smoking was ineffective in reducing their children's exposure to environmental tobacco smoke. the intervention did not change parents' propensity to create or maintain bans on smoking in their homes or otherwise change smoking habits to reduce their children's exposure to ets. enrolling mothers and fathers into tobacco treatment services during the immediate postpartum hospital stay is feasible and seems to stimulate quit attempts. confronting mothers with their initial concentrations of cotinine was not found to be an additional factor reducing tobacco consumption. more treatment (35%) than control (17%) subjects reported smoking outside their homes at posttest (and their children's cotinine levels were lower), but this difference was not statistically significant. baseline comparison showed no significant differences between the two groups in the mothers' actions to protect the children from passive smoking exposure. significant or near significant time main effects were seen for children's hair cotinine, per cent confirmed reducers, and, in particular, parent reports of exposure. the absolute risk reduction was 7.9% (95% confidence interval: 3.78% to 12.01%). there was no impact of group assignment on the quit rate, cigarettes/day, or stage of change. the mean log ratio of the follow-up to initial urine cotinine measurements was 6% lower in the intervention group than in the control group. asthma symptom days declined more in the high-intensity group, although the across-group difference did not reach statistical significance (p=.138). the prevalence of persistent lower respiratory symptoms was lower among intervention-group infants of smoking mothers whose head of household had no education beyond high school: intervention group, 14.6%; and controls, 34.0%. there were no differences between the groups in the exposure of infants to tobacco smoke. at 12 and 18 months, there was little impact for either intervention on the main outcomes: child injury (shv: relative risk 0.99; 95% confidence intervals 0.68 to 1.45, cgs: 0.91; 0.61 to1.36), maternal smoking (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to 1.19, cgs: 0.97; 0.72 to 1.33) or maternal depression (shv: 0.86; 0.62 to1.19, cgs: 0.93; 0.69 to 1.27). we found no significant differences between the groups with respect to change in smoking behaviour. children's urinary cotinine concentrations did not show significant change over time in either group. no significant differences in total and specific immunoglobulin e were found between the groups. there were no significant differences between subjects in the three groups in use of the self-help guides, methods used to attempt quitting, and quitting behavior. the 6-month nicotine levels were significantly lower in mi households. after 1 year, more study than control families (72.1% vs 33.1%, p = .006) reported that their asthmatic child took responsibility for the asthma management. provision to mothers of both groups of health risks of tobacco smoke resulted in significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the control group, with child intervention group having significantly higher rate of cessation of smoking and smoking location change than those of the maternal intervention group (p < 0.05). significantly greater change occurred in the counseling group than the control groups and was sustained throughout the 2 years of follow-up. the quit rate at 1 month was 7.5% (95% ci, 0-21) in the intervention group and 2.5% (95% ci, 0-7) in the control group. the intervention reduced smoking (5.9% vs 2.7%) and relapse (55% vs 45%) at 6-month follow-up, but logistic regression analysis at 12 months revealed no significant treatment effect. cotinine prevalence decreased from 54% to 40% among coached families, while it increased from 43% to 49% among controls. school intervention condition was not a factor in the prediction of experimentation. at both follow-ups, abstinence rates were twice as great in the intervention group as in the control group (7.7% vs 3.4% and 13.5% vs 6.9%, respectively). the effect was stronger in mothers and in higher social groups. in particular, significant and positive differences were found in parenting with the intervention group feeling less restrictions imposed by the parenting role, greater sense of competence in parenting, greater acceptability of the child, and the child being more likely to provide positive reinforcement to the parent. at 12 months the cotinine concentration in the counselled group was 55.6% (48.2% to 63.0%) that of controls. after the intervention, cotinine levels were reduced in the intervention group (165 ng/ml) and increased in the control group (346 ng/ml).|143 latino parent-child pairs san diego, california child with asthma infancy areas of san diego county with a large latino population parents of sick children young

and apolipoprotein b after valsartan treatment. the bp reductions after 4 weeks of treatment with telmisartan were no different from those achieved with enalapril. telmisartan 40 mg/hctz 12.5 mg significantly reduced mean supine sbp by 18.8 mm hg, a benefit of 6.6 mm hg compared with telmisartan 40 mg and 11.9 mm hg compared with hctz 12.5 mg (both, p < 0.01). at week 8, statistically significant reductions over placebo were observed in trough seated blood pressure with all irbesartan doses > or = 50 mg. reductions were also noted in standing sbp (monotherapy: p<0.001; combination therapy: p=0.03). with irbesartan, mean blood pressure decreased significantly and proportionally to the baseline levels of active renin, and angiotensin i and ii. aliskiren 300 and 600 mg lowered mean sitting dbp significantly more than irbesartan 150 mg (p<0.05). all combination regimens produced a statistically significantly greater reduction in msdpb and mssbp than the corresponding monotherapies. the reduction in sitting sbp was significantly greater for losartan than placebo the 16- and 32-mg doses were consistently significantly superior to placebo in antihypertensive effect with regard to all bp measurements, including peak (6 hours after treatment), trough, sitting, and standing measurements of diastolic and systolic bp. all active treatment groups were shown to demonstrate significant reductions in sdbp compared to placebo at endpoint of therapy (least mean square reduction from baseline: the 300 mg dose of irbesartan was associated with the lowest incidence of adverse events (ae) and discontinuations because of ae. all treatments were well tolerated; there were no treatment-related serious adverse events. at 24 hours after dosing, the blood pressure changes obtained with losartan potassium 50 mg were essentially identical to those obtained with enalapril maleate 20 mg. for reduction of systolic blood pressure (sbp), eplerenone was superior to placebo and losartan in all patients combined and in black patients, and was superior to placebo in white patients. sitting systolic blood pressure (sisbp) was significantly lowered with losartan monotherapy, by 6.4 mm hg, compared with placebo (reduction of 2.3 mm hg). valsartan produced a significantly higher number of responders (62%) than losartan (55%, p = .02) at the 8 week treatment endpoint. statistically significant differences in responder rates at end point were seen for doses of valsartan of 80 mg and above compared with placebo, whereas the responder rates for valsartan 20 mg was not significantly different from that for placebo. olmesartan medoxomil and amlodipine produced significantly greater reductions in ambulatory and seated dbp and sbp compared with placebo. compared with losartan, telmisartan 80 mg produced significantly (p < 0.05) greater reductions in both sbp and dbp during all monitored periods of the 24-h period, while telmisartan 40 mg produced significantly greater reductions in sbp and dbp in the night-time period (10.01 pm to 5.59 am) (p < 0.05) and in dbp in the morning period (6.00 am to 11.59 am) treatment with olmesartan medoxomil resulted in a significant placebo-adjusted reduction of mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure of 9.6 mm hg, 12.2 mm hg, and 10.6 mm hg in the 5-, based on trough blood pressures at week 12, active drug (both arms) was more effective than placebo in lowering sitting diastolic blood pressure, with a very small additional benefit associated with increasing the dose of losartan to 100 mg in patients who did not reach the target blood pressure after the first 6 weeks on losartan 50 mg. results were similar at weeks 4 and 8 for all treatment groups except that the magnitude of change was greater at week 8. moreover, significant (p < .05) placebo-adjusted differences in ambulatory sbp/dbp and a significant dose-response relationship (p < .001) were observed with all tasosartan dosages during the 24-h, daytime, and nighttime periods. the 95% confidence intervals for the difference from placebo were -8.1 to 4.1 for sitdbp and -11.0 to -4.0 for sitsbp (both, p<0.0001). augmentation index reduction was greater with valsartan (-22 +/- 11) than with hctz (-3 +/- similar falls were found in both of the active treatment groups with mean changes in sdbp at 8 weeks of -9.5 mmhg for valsartan and -9.4 mmhg for enalapril (-4.5 mmhg for placebo). compared with placebo treatment, trough dbp was significantly reduced by a mean (95% ci) of 8.9 (6.0; 11.8) mm hg with 8 mg and 10.3 (7.4; all olmesartan medoxomil/hctz combinations significantly reduced sedbp and sesbp compared with placebo in a dose-dependent manner. compared with placebo, tasosartan produced significantly (p

malignancy was suspected in 405 women (3.2%) who were recalled for complete mammography. half were assigned to a control group and were not invited for examination until four years after the code was broken in the mmst in 1988. breast cancer screening appears not to affect the rate of mortality from causes of death other than breast cancer. mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease and lung cancer over the first 5 year period of follow up are examined. the cumulative number of advanced mammary carcinomas in the screening and the control populations from the first five years of screening have shown a tendency towards more favourable stages in the screened population aged 40-64 years. the survival rates were similar in the two groups. the rates of false-positive mammography at first and subsequent routine screens were 4.9% and 3.2%, respectively. the benefit in terms of cumulative breast cancer mortality started to emerge at about 4 years after randomisation and continued to increase to about 10 years. in the age group 65-74 at randomisation there was a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality in the screened group, with a relative mortality of 0.68 and 95% confidence interval of 0.51 to 0.89. in a randomized controlled trial with mammographic screening for early detection of breast cancer, 314 non-palpable breast lesions were examined by open

however, there was no difference in the increases that occurred between the two groups. it was also found that subjects having with-the-rule astigmatism progressed more slowly than those having no astigmatism or against-the-rule astigmatism. all atropine groups showed significantly less myopic progression than the control group (1.06+/-0.61 d/y) (p<0.01). the use of pals slowed myopia progression, although the treatment effect was small, as previously reported in ethnically diverse children in the united states. pirenzepine is effective and relatively safe in slowing the progression of myopia during a 1-year treatment period. the differences in the increases of the spherical equivalents were not statistically significant in the right eye, but in the left eye the change in the distant use group was significantly higher (-1.87 d) than in the continuous use group (-1.46 d) (p = 0.02, student's t test).|myopic children with esophoria 188 patients available for the follow-up 6 through 12 years of age with myopia between -1 and -4 diopters, astigmatism <or= 2 diopters, no prior contact lens wear, no other ocular pathologies juvenile myopia, each of 207 children between the ages of 6 and 15 years wore single vision lenses, +1.00 d add bifocals, or +2.00 d add bifocals for a period of 3 years subjects who entered the study at an early age with a large amount of myopia, and tended to be the least rapid for subjects who entered the study at a later age with a small amount of myopia 135 children (mean age, 10.29 years [se, 0.15 years];

the 6-minute walking distance by 20% and 14% in the air and oxygen group, respectively, when the patients were tested on air. heliox21 significantly increased walking distance (99+/-101 m) and reduced dyspnea (borg score, -0.76+/-0.77) compared with medical air. walking distance was increased by more than 50% by comparison with an unburdened walk in seven patients with the endurance walking test but in only three patients with the six minute walking test. at isotime, compared to room air, there were significant reductions in dyspnoea score, eelv, eilv, v'e and respiratory frequency (fr) with fi,o2=0.3. significant improvements were also noted in anxiety and depression and in certain domains of the sf-36. the mean arterial oxygen saturation (sao2) after oxygen (93%) was significantly higher than after compressed air (91%). in nds patients, o(2) administration reduced dyspnea by 47% (p < 0.001), but the distance walked did not improve. breathing oxygen for five or fifteen minutes before exercise but not during exercise (predose) resulted in a similar improvement in exercise tolerance. however, women experienced less dyspnea when receiving o2 as compared with compressed air (p = 0.0025), and although not statistically significant, the lower dyspnea with o2 corresponded with an increased walk distance of 79 feet. no increase in mean walk distance after oxygen (288 v 283 m) and no improvement in mean breathlessness scores (58 v 54 mm) or recovery times occurred with oxygen taken either before (177 v 184 seconds) or after exercise (182 v 151 seconds). supplemental oxygen increased 6mwd and steps by small, statistically significant increments acutely at baseline and after 6 and 12 wk, without corresponding falls in borg score. there was no significant difference in the mean arterial oxygen saturation (sao2) using the pdod system or with continuous flow oxygen (p = 0.33). hyperoxia and normoxic helium independently reduce dynamic hyperinflation and improve the exercise tolerance of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd). after training, endurance in constant work rate tests increased more in the oxygen-trained group (14.5 minutes) than in the air-trained group (10.5 minutes) (p < 0.05). over the 6-month study period, there were no significant differences between patient groups in hrql (chronic respiratory questionnaire (crq),

low-fat milk (p = 0.046), the increase in systolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmhg (p = 0.024), and the reduction in diastolic blood pressure by 2.1 mmhg (p < 0.001). the intervention demonstrated no evidence for an impact on vegetable consumption, physical activity, smoking and alcohol consumption and weak evidence for a small impact on (intermediate) outcomes of fruit consumption. more respondents in the intervention (82%) than control (67%) area were aware of local health projects. results indicated little consistent evidence of a treatment effect on physical activity knowledge, attitudes, or self-efficacy in either men or women. smoking prevalence declined (from 27.9% to 17.6%) in the intervention population. the proportion who increased their body mass was 14.2% lower in the intervention district (p < 0.001), implying a 50% relative reduction compared with the control district, and was lower across subgroups. although there was an increase in the rate of walking-trail use, a community-wide change in walking rates in rural communities was not documented. there were no statistically significant program effects detected in the independent sample surveys, although physical inactivity increased more in the comparison community than in st-henri. the community intervention hartslag limburg succeeded in preventing age- and time-related unfavorable changes in energy intake, fat consumption, walking, and bicycling, particularly among women and those with low ses. the project had a slightly favorable intervention effect on cholesterol and smoking, but failed to have an effect on other risk factors for cardiovascular disease. significant positive changes were observed in knowledge levels at a community level in the district of intervention compared with baseline knowledge levels particularly in relation to a heart healthy diet, beneficial level of physical activity, the causes of high blood pressure and heart attack and the effects of high blood pressure and active and passive smoking on health. among the dependent variables, walking showed some evidence of a positive linear trend across dose categories (p = 0.090). the intervention,

group, this decrease was not statistically significant (p = 0.214). there was no significant difference in the mean vas scores after treatment, but naltrexone allowed a dramatic decrease in vas scores (delta >3/10) in 7 patients. plasma histamine levels were high (mean 2.32 montelukast is more effective than placebo in the treatment of uremic pruritus not responding to the currently available antipruritus drugs, and it can be considered as a new and rather safe and effective treatment option in uremic patients. twelve patients (50.0%) complained of drowsiness that alleviated in all cases after 2 days in average. the results of this study do not demonstrate that tacrolimus ointment 0.1% is more effective than vehicle in relieving uremic pruritus. the pruritus improved considerably in four of the five treated patients, whereas only one of those treated with placebo experienced relief. no significant alterations were noted in the serum concentrations of standard laboratory variables, including lipids, alkaline phosphatase, phosphorus, or calcium, during treatment with either charcoal or placebo. mean difference between placebo and paroxetine was 0.78 the success rate was significantly greater in the propofol group (84%) than in the placebo (16%) group (p less than 0.05). there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to pruritus scores, quality-of-life scores, and severity of cutaneous scratch lesions. uraemic pruritus is a common and distressing symptom in patients on haemodialysis for chronic renal failure. no changes in biochemical tests or side effects were observed during this period. after four weeks of treatment, the mean decrease in pruritus score in gabapentin and placebo groups was 6.7 +/- there was no significant difference in pruritus scores before the treatment between the two groups, but after each week, the difference was significant (p < .001). during the naltrexone period, pruritus decreased by 29.2% (95% confidence interval [ci], 18.7 to 39.6) on the vas and by 17.6% (95% ci, 4.2 to 31.1) on the detailed score. serum levels of intact pth did not correlate with the intensity of pruritus and did not significantly change during treatment with capsaicin or placebo. pruritus decreased by 16% (95% ci: 0.5-32%) during active treatment and by 25% (95% ci: 9-41%) during treatment with placebo. vas showed greater and more significant changes with naltrexone than with placebo (p<0.0003). the most common adr was insomnia (sleep disturbance), seen in 24 of the 226 nalfurafine patients. in conclusion, thalidomide can be a precious tool in the handling of uremic pruritus unresponsive to available therapy. flumecinol did not significantly affect liver function tests, antipyrine clearance or serum total bile acids, and was not associated with any significant side-effects. sertraline seems to be an effective, well-tolerated treatment for pruritus due to chronic liver disease. improvements in itching (p = 0.0025) and excoriations (p = 0.0060) were noted for the nalfurafine-treated patients. mean pruritus score using visual analogue scale and scratching activity were reduced on the first treatment day compared with baseline in both the ondansetron and placebo groups (p < 0.05), but there were no significant differences in mean pruritus perception or scratching activity between the two groups. therapy with erythropoietin induced a decrease in plasma histamine concentrations in both groups of patients with uremia, and recurrences of pruritus after the discontinuation of erythropoietin were accompanied by increases in plasma histamine concentrations. local application of capsaicin depletes the peripheral neurons of substance p and may block the conduction of pain or pruritus. the median daily pruritus score did not change significantly during active or placebo treatment (preondansetron, 5. 3; interquartile range [iqr], 3.4 to 6.3; during ondansetron, 3.9; iqr, 2.7 to 5.0; p = not significant; preplacebo, 3.7; iqr, 3.0 to 4. 6; during placebo, 3.6; iqr, 2.4 to 4.8; p = not significant).|pruritus of cholestasis adult hemodialysis patients 17 took colesevelam,

no significant difference was found between the two treatments with respect to total symptoms, score and visual analogue scale assessment. we found no significant differences between groups regarding total number of recorded adverse events (aes). there were no significant differences in demographics or substance use parameters between the divalproex group (n = 6) or the lorazepam group (n = 5). differences in the polysomnographic variables of sleep continuitiy and sleep architecture at t0 and t1 found between the clomethiazole and the placebo patients correspond to rebound insomnia following discontinuation of clomethiazole. there was no difference between the three treatments in ratings of alcohol withdrawal symptoms nor requests for additional medication. the relative risk of recurrence between groups was 0.868 with a 95% confidence interval of 0.412 to 1.826. mean total milligrams of oxazepam received, progression of withdrawal symptoms, psychological distress as measured by the symptom checklist-90, side effects, and adverse outcomes were compared between groups. subjective and objective ratings of abstinence symptoms and subjective mood disturbance decreased significantly in intensity in both groups over 5 days, but there were no significant treatment differences nor treatment by time interactions. in general, the drugs were found to be equally efficacious in treating the withdrawal syndrome and not significantly different with respect to side effects. lorazepam-treated patients had a significant rebound of alcohol withdrawal symptoms post-treatment (p =.007) and the risk of having a first drink was 3 times greater (p =.04) than for carbamazepine-treated patients. no significant differences between the two treatments could be demonstrated in the parameters studied. there was no statistically significant difference between the response rates for the two treatments (p greater than .05). symptom reduction occurred more rapidly and consistently in the depakote treated patients than in the benzodiazepine control group, and at six-week follow up a greater percentage of patients in the depakote maintenance group were completely abstinent than either detox-only group. diazepam given under this regimen is a safe and effective sedative for management of combative patients with severe delirium tremens. bromocriptine was ineffective in treating withdrawal symptoms, whilst chlormethiazole and chlordiazepoxide were equally effective. no differences were found in the need for rescue medication clo, decrease of withdrawal symptoms, or craving for alcohol between the oxc and the placebo group. patients with limited previous withdrawals reported similar treatment effects on self-reports of sleep and sleepiness for gabapentin and lorazepam. cardiac complications were significantly (p=.0047) increased in the flunitrazepam/clonidine group. on the whole a small tendency to more symptom items being reduced on piracetam in comparison with chlormethiazole was found. the change in the total symptom score from the first day of treatment to the second was significantly greater in the carbamazepine group than in the placebo group. there were no significant differences in the proportion of treatment completers between treatment groups or the proportion of patients in each group requiring rescue medication for breakthrough signs and symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. there was no decrease in white blood counts under carbamazepine. efficacy and safety were not different between groups (total group: delirium, 3.9%; seizure, 0.8%), except for a lack of efficacy in 18% of intoxicated tiapride/carbamazepine patients. no difference between the two drugs tested was found in the milder conditions, but barbital was found superior to diazepam in the treatment of fully developed delirium tremens. all the patients receiving chlormethiazole had uneventful withdrawals. other withdrawal symptoms disappeared more quickly in the sodium valproate group even though fewer patients were receiving chlormethiazole. no serious side effects were detected. all active medications significantly reduced observer-rated and self-rated withdrawal severity, dysphoric mood, and supplementary diazepam administration compared with placebo. analysis indicated both drugs to be of equivalent potency and were equally well tolerated by patients. patients of both groups were similar in age, weight, duration of drinking, ingested quantities of alcohol and intensity of withdrawal symptoms in both groups. both itt and completer analyses revealed no significant differences between the groups considering the primary effectiveness measure: amount of clo required in the first 24 hours (p = 6.1 +/- levels of hva in the cerebrospinal fluid did not differ between the treatment groups and the controls and did not change during treatment. subjectively experienced side effects, normalization of vegetative parameters and improvement in the cognitive processing speed did not reveal differences for both groups. however, plasma catecholamines, blood pressure, and pulse rate fell more rapidly and to a greater extent during clonidine than following chlormethiazole, findings which could have therapeutic implications.|patients who had previous withdrawals fifty-five patients who had seized from alcohol withdrawal twenty male alcoholics with alcohol withdrawal syndrome hospitalized patients with pre-delirium tremens a total of 180 patients were included in the study;

95% ci: 2.9-10.4, p =0.02). the incidence of gram-negative septicemia also decreased. after an educational intervention in 3 intensive care units, 34 central line-associated bloodstream infections occurred in 11,582 central venous catheter [cvc]-days, compared with 45 episodes in 10,661 cvc-days before intervention (4.22 vs 2.94 episodes per 1,000 cvc-days [30.9% reduction]; p = .03, wilcoxon rank sum test; p = .11, poisson regression analysis). hierarchical regression modeling showed that the only significant predictor of an observed decrease in infection rates was the collective use of the insertion and maintenance bundles, as demonstrated by the relative rate (rr) and confidence intervals (cis) (rr: 0.57 [95% ci: 0.45-0.74]; p < .0001). after the implementation of the education module, the number of primary bloodstream infections fell to 26 in 7044 catheter days (3.7 per 1000 catheter days), a decrease of 66% (p < .0001). the incidence of crb fell from an average level of 6.97 per 1,000 catheter-days during the control period to an average of 1.68 during the study period.|4,283 patients were admitted to the icu between january 1, 1998, and december 31, 2000 one hundred ninety-one 106 ventilated patients between january 2000 and december 2003, all patients admitted to the medical icu were surveyed prospectively for the development of catheter-associated bloodstream infection twenty-four bed surgical/trauma/burn intensive care units in an urban university hospital five intensive care units in barnes-jewish hospital, an urban teaching hospital six hundred and seventy-seven adult patients, mechanically ventilated for >48 h were included in the study population 1,400-bed university-affiliated urban teaching hospital patients requiring mechanical ventilation who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia between october 1, 1999, and september 30, 2001 all mechanically ventilated patients that were admitted to the intensive care unit between june 1, 2004 and may 31, 2005 two geographically proximate medical centers, inclusive of five intensive care units located in the southwestern region of the united states had significant variations in their vap rates 27 public wards ventilator-associated pneumonia rates in a surgical intensive care unit 373 patients with a cvc (163 in the preintervention period and 210 in the postintervention period) were studied neonates with a central venous catheter (cvc) from a neonatal intensive care unit database eighteen-bed surgical/burn/trauma intensive care unit (icu) in an urban teaching hospital four adult intensive care units in a 583-bed tertiary care hospital

expressing hla-dr|wound infections were more common following oa (n = 11) than lal (n = 4) or las (n = 0) (p < 0.05, < 0.001). unlike other minimally invasive procedures, laparoscopic appendectomy did not offer a significant advantage over open appendectomy in all studied parameters except quality of life scores at 2 weeks. there were no complications of laparoscopy. there was no significant difference between the two groups with regard to the appearance of the appendix. the laparoscopic group had a significant reduced postoperative narcotic requirement (p<0.05), quicker reintroduction of diet and quicker return to normal activity. the relative risk of removing a healthy appendix in open surgery was 6.6 relative risk (range, 2-21 c.i.) as compared with laparoscopy. laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform than open appendectomy (median, 107 vs 91 minutes; p <.01) and was associated with fewer days to return to a general diet (mean, 1.6 versus 2.3 days; p <.01), a shorter duration of parenteral analgesia (mean, 1.6 versus 2.2 days; p <.01), fewer morphine-equivalent milligrams of parenteral narcotic (median, 14 mg versus 34 mg; p =.001), a shorter postoperative hospital stay (mean, 2.6 versus 3.4 days; p <.01), and earlier return to full activity (median, 14 versus 21 days; p <.02). no statistically significant differences could be found with respect to surgical and general complications, operating time, consumption of analgesics and antibiotics, and return to work. in the post-operative period the counts of t-lymphocytes and monocytes expressing hla-dr were similar in both groups. the oa group rendered a greater wound-complication rate and ileus than did the other two groups, but the differences were not detected between the three categories ( p = 0.065, 0.6935). mean operative time was longer in the la group (p < 0.05). when compared to open appendectomy the laparoscopic group had a longer median operating time (63 minutes versus 40 minutes), fewer wound infections (2% versus 11%), less requirement for narcotic analgesia, and an earlier return to normal activity (median 7 days versus 14 days). laparoscopy was associated with no added complications, no increase in hospital stay in patients who went on to appendicectomy, and a reduction in hospital stay for those who underwent laparoscopy alone. when the groups were compared according to the subgroups of gastro-intestinal quality of life index, except for disease-specific items, in all categories a significant improvement was seen in the laparoscopically treated patients. there was no significant difference in duration of sick leave after operation (laparoscopic group 11 days versus open group 14 days). functional status was significantly better in the la group 7-10 days after operation (p = 0.045). postoperative pain was significantly less in the la group on the 1st (p < 0.001) and 2nd (p < 0.001) postoperative day, resulting in less use of analgesics on both days (p < 0.001). laparoscopic appendectomy took longer to perform without affecting significantly the needs for postoperative analgesia, the duration of hospital stay and the time to return to normal activities when compared with open appendectomy in men. there was no significant difference in postoperative pain or fatigue, but return to normal life was faster in the la group (14 versus 26. 5 days). there was no significant difference in postoperative morbidity rate in the two groups. we found that la is associated with a shorter hospital stay, fewer postoperative complications, and better diagnostic accuracy, and it is recommended as the procedure of choice for the diagnosis and management of acute appendicitis. length of stay averaged 21.5 h for the laparoscopic group and was not statistically different when compared to the open group. there was no difference between groups for demographic data (particularly macroscopic aspect of appendix) analgesia, sedation, delay before eating and walking, incidence of urinary retention, nausea, vomiting. though laparoscopic appendectomy started endoscopic surgery in general surgery, it has yet not reached the acceptance as is the case with cholecystectomy. the complication rate after open appendectomy (25.8%) was not significantly different from that after laparoscopic appendectomy (12.1%). this occurred at an average of 25 days for the open appendectomy group versus 14 days for the laparoscopic appendectomy group (p < 0.001). the mean hospital stay for la was 3.23 days compared with 3.03 days for oa (p < 0.001). la is a more expensive alternative and offers no advantages related to pain relief, length of stay, return to normal activities, or morbidity. no positive blood cultures were demonstrated in the open operated group. laparoscopy was associated with fewer wound infections (p < 0.03) and improved cosmesis (p < 0.001), but the operating time was longer (60 versus 40 min). in young women with right lower abdominal pain, laparoscopy can give precise diagnosis and reduce the rate of negative appendectomies. the data from this prospective, randomized, double-blind study failed to demonstrate any significant reduction in lost workdays, postoperative pain, or operative time with laparoscopic appendectomy. there were no statistically significant differences between the la and oa groups in operative risk: mean age, 28 +/- laparoscopic appendectomy does not offer any proved benefits compared with the open approach for the routine patient with acute appendicitis. laparoscopic appendectomy has no advantages in terms of convalescence and time to return to work when compared to open appendectomy and should therefore be limited to selected cases. laparoscopic appendectomy is comparable to open appendectomy with regard to complications, hospital stay, cost, return to activity, and return to work. laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anesthetic time (72.5 minutes versus 55 minutes) and actual operating time (45 minutes versus 25 minutes) compared with open appendectomy. excess operating and complication costs per procedure were 96 euros (eur) in laparoscopic appendectomy. there were no differences in hospital stay or the postoperative course of the patients. despite an increasing metabolic acidosis, prolonged carbon dioxide pneumoperitoneum resulted in only a slight increase in plasma potassium concentrations, which was both statistically and clinically insignificant. laparoscopic appendectomy required significantly longer anaesthetic time (78 minutes versus 51) and operating time (49 minutes versus 23) compared with open appendectomy. the risk of unnecessary appendicectomy was significantly (p = 0.03) lower after laparoscopy. laparoscopic appendicectomy has higher direct costs than open operation and is not as cost-effective when the longterm outcome is the same in both groups. the outcome following laparoscopic appendicectomy for confirmed acute appendicitis is at least equivalent to that achieved with conventional appendicectomy. average postoperative length of stay without any complications was 6.2 +/-2.5 days in the open group and 4.3 +/- the operative time in la group was significantly (p < 0.001) longer (87.2 minutes) than for oa group (65.2 minutes). the operating time seemed to be shorter for the oa patients than for the la patients, but the difference was not significant (la, 30 +/- there were five (9 per cent) wound infections after open appendicectomy compared with none after the laparoscopic operation (p < 0.01). wound infection incidence was lower in the laparoscopic group.|fertile women one hundred and sixty-three patients with laparoscopically confirmed appendicitis suitable for la 30 women with

with vancomycin regarding gram-positive (gram+) infections and infections with gram-negative (gram-) organisms usually resistant to pefloxacin. there was no statistical difference in the occurrence of documented septicemia, documented coccus gram-positive infections, or fever of unknown origins during aplasia in the 2 groups. norfloxacin was better tolerated (30 of 36 versus 16 of 30 patients highly compliant, p = 0.02), and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (eight of 36 versus 14 of 36 patients, p = 0.07). no side effects that related to ofloxacin were noted. there was no significant difference in the occurrence of febrile days, febrile episodes, the duration of antibiotic treatment, the number of sepsis in two groups. no infections caused by gram-negative bacilli were seen in the ciprofloxacin group (p less than 0.02). the compliance was better in group i but the treatment had to be modified in 9 patients of group i because of liver abnormalities.(abstract truncated at 250 words) 20% of the treated subjects versus 68.6% of the controls presented a subsequent infection (p less than 0.001), the lung representing the most frequent site of the infectious disease in both groups (3/6 and 14/24 respectively). the incidence of infection was higher in the trimethoprim group (50 percent) than in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (39 percent), but this did not reach statistical significance. there were significantly fewer overall infections (10 versus 3; p = 0.016) and streptococcal infections (9 versus 1; p = 0.0078) in the group receiving gram-positive prophylaxis. bacteraemia due to resistant gram-negative rods occurred only in the co-trimoxazole-colistin group though both regimens were effective for selective gastrointestinal tract decontamination. clinically, the prophylactic efficacy was 92% for the oflx regimen and 40% for the control regimen (p less than 0.01). prophylactic administration of ciprofloxacin and vancomycin reduced the incidence of neutropenic fever in patients receiving hdt with asct, however, without affecting the total interval of hospitalization, time to engraftment, or all-cause mortality. ofloxacin was significantly better tolerated than trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and shortened the duration of fever (p = 0.02) and of parenteral antimicrobial therapy for presumed or documented acquired infection (p = 0.01). however, c + r combination prophylaxis significantly reduced the incidence of gram-positive bacteremia (five versus zero episodes) but was associated with a higher incidence of drug-related side effects. prophylaxis with fluoroquinolones reduced the occurrence of infection in adult neutropenic patients without affecting the long-term survival. gram-positive and gram-negative infections were significantly less frequent in patients receiving pv, because of fewer infections with staphylococcus species and enterobacteriaceae. the addition of vancomycin resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of patients with surveillance cultures positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (stool cultures, 44 versus 23%; throat swab cultures, 37 versus 19%) and alpha-hemolytic streptococci (throat swab cultures, 90 versus 60%). fever or infection (without fever) developed in 190 (71%) of 268 evaluable patients in the penicillin arm compared with 213 (80%) of 268 evaluable patients in the placebo arm (p = .03; 95% confidence interval [ci] for the difference, -16% to -1%). the incidence of febrile days and of days on parenteral antibiotic therapy was significantly lower in the group given tmp-smz and colistin (p less than 0.05). gram-positive cocci were isolated less frequently from tmp-smz-treated, bacteremic patients, but more of their isolates were resistant to tmp-smz than were those from placebo recipients. four significant differences were observed between the group given tmp/stx (30 patients) and the control group (33 patients): 1) the mean duration of severe granulocytopenia (less than or equal to 500 pmn/mm3) before the first febrile episode was longer in prophylaxis group, 14.26 days versus four in the control group (p less than 0.001); 2) the number of febrile episodes was 37 in tmp/stx group and 69 in control group (p less than 0.01); 3) 23 patients on prophylaxis presented at least one febrile episode versus 33 in the control group (p less than 0.01); 4) deaths due to infection were two in the tmp/stx group versus 11 in control group (p less than 0.05). fifteen patients in the control group developed febrile neutropenia versus 12 of those in the ciprofloxacin group (p = 0.69). there were no differences in the incidence of gram-positive infections nor in the length of hospitalization between the two treatment arms. no significant differences in survival, frequency of bacteremia, overall infections, use of systemic antimicrobial therapy, or adverse effects, including myelosuppression, were observed between patients receiving tmp-smz vs. those receiving placebo. although there was a trend toward a reduction in the overall incidence of bacteremia (12 v 4 patients), and gram-positive bacteremia (8 v 2 patients) with the addition of rifampin, none of these comparisons was statistically significant (p =.05 and p =.09, respectively). the death rate from infection was significantly reduced in patients who received antibiotics for gut flora suppression in conventional ward isolation compared with the corresponding control group. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis resulted in fewer microbiologically documented infections (seven versus 15; p = 0.029). no statistically significant difference was found among the treatment arms with respect to the overall incidence of febrile neutropenic episodes as defined for this trial (79% for the norfloxacin group, 82% for the ofloxacin group, and 77% for the ofloxacin plus rifampin group). group d streptococcus species were poorly suppressed by gn compared with gvn, although no patient developed an infection with these organisms. although there was no difference between the two arms in the proportion of patients developing fever or in the median number of days of fever, the time to onset of fever was a mean of 1 day longer in each patient on the pre-emptive arm (log rank p<0.001). both drugs showed an effective elimination of gram-negative potential pathogens and staphylococcus aureus not affecting the anaerobic flora of the gastrointestinal tract. norfloxacin was more effective than cotrimoxazole for preventing acquisition of aerobic gram-negative bacilli in surveillance cultures. only one infection caused by gram-negative bacilli was observed in the pefloxacin group compared with seven in the norfloxacin group (p = 0.019). there were no differences between the two groups in age (mean 33 years, range 11-54), sex, diagnosis and mean duration of agranulocytosis (21.8 days, range 10-49). ofloxacin was also better tolerated (24 of 30 versus 10 of 32 patients highly compliant, p = 0.01) and associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects (one of 30 versus nine of 32 patients with gastrointestinal side effects, p = 0.01) than vancomycin/polymyxin. with regard to the side effects, there was no significant difference in the two groups. the percentage of febrile granulocytopenic days was significantly reduced in group 1, 19 per cent compared to 39 per cent in group 2 (p less than 0.01). eleven of 16 microbiologically documented infections in the tmp/smx group and 7 of 11 in the nor group were caused by gram negative bacilli (gnb). the use of quinolones was associated with a delay in the fever onset during neutropenia (p = 0.0448), a decrease in the proportion of neutropenic febrile days (p = 0.0456), a decrease of infections caused by gram-negative bacilli (p = 0.037) and an increase of streptococcus infections (p = 0.0857). both treatment groups acquired yeasts. significantly more patients had skin rashes following co-trimoxazole than ofloxacin treatment (p less than 0.05). vancomycin was found to be highly effective in preventing gram-positive infections that occurred in 11 of 30 patients in the control group versus zero of 30 in the vancomycin group (p less than .002). the incidences of superficial skin and overall infections were significantly lower in those patients with multiple relapses who received trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (p = 0.008); however, there was no difference between the groups in regard to days of fever, days of antibiotic administration, days of hospitalization, or gram-negative rod bacteremia. side effects were not significantly different, but compliance with ciprofloxacin was better. a decrease in the total number of acquired infections was found (16 infections in the group given trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole versus 31 in the control group, p less than 0.01). no differences were noted between the two groups with respect to secondary outcome measures, including time to endpoint, occurrence of fever, type and number of microbiologically documented infections, and administration of intravenous antibiotics. a decrease in the number of major acquired infections was observed: three infections occurred in 16 patients receiving the sam regimen compared with eight infections in 17 patients given the placebo. prophylactic treatment with levofloxacin is an effective and well-tolerated way of preventing febrile episodes and other relevant infection-related outcomes in patients with cancer and profound and protracted neutropenia. patients in group a had significantly more episodes of afebrile aplasia (34.5% vs 4%) and less bacteriemias (10% vs 48%) than those in group b. also fever developed later in group a (mean: 12.5 vs 6 days). the laf plus a patients had a significantly decreased incidence of total infection, bacteremias, pneumonias, rectal abscesses, urinary tract infection, and pharyngitis. patients with initial leukopenia of grade who iii-i had only a 11% infection rate showing no significant difference between the treatment groups. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found to be easily taken, to suppress the enterobacteriaceae, and to maintain the anaerobic rectal flora for biological stability of the rectal ecosystem. incidence of infection at less than 100 granulocytes/microliters was significantly reduced in the tmp/smz group (2 infections/100 days) compared to placebo (11 infections/100 days, p = 0.005). infections due to gram negative bacteria decreased to 33.3% in the ap group (vs. 92% in the control group), but infections due to gram positive bacteria increased to 66.7% (vs. 8% in the control group). prophylaxis was continued until the neutropenia resolved (granulocytes greater than 0.5.10(9)/l) or until the onset of infectious symptoms. only two gram-negative bacterial infections occurred in the cip + col arm compared with 16 in the neo + col arm. there was no difference in the incidence and severity of graft-versus-host disease or incidence and duration of fever. in conclusion, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in prevention of gram-positive bacteremias. patients receiving ciprofloxacin also had fewer days of fever (average 6.5 days versus 9.8 days for the polymyxin b group, p less than 0.02). the number of days with fever > 38.5 degrees c was significantly higher in the control (vanco-) group than in the vanco+ group (7.4 vs. 3.7, p < 0.02). st + cpfx was significantly effective than st alone (p < 0.005). tms prophylaxis was associated with a higher incidence of c difficile enterocolitis and infections caused by gram-negative bacilli, as well as a trend toward prolongation of granulocytopenia. the incidence of fever was not significantly different between episodes treated with tmz-e (18/27) and those treated with p (17/29), nor was there a significant difference in the median interval between the onset of neutropenia and the onset of fever. among patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors or lymphoma, the prophylactic use of levofloxacin reduces the incidence of fever, probable infection, and hospitalization. ciprofloxacin recipients required fewer days of therapeutic antimicrobials (median: 28 antibiotic-days vs. 49, p0.02). this benefit was also associated with a 30% increase in the probability of failure-free survival at day 15 (p = 0.138). three significant differences were observed between the co-trmoxazole and the control groups: (i) 15 of the 16 (94%) control patients but only 8 of the 14 (57%) patients on co-trimoxazole developed infections and required additional antibiotics intravenously; (ii) although the duration of severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 0.1 times 10(9)/1) was similar in the two groups, control patients required intravenous antibiotics on average after 2 days of neutropenia, whereas patients receiving co-trimoxazole required these only after 12 days; and (iii) the only 2 patients who died of infection were in the control group. furthermore, side effects were fewer and compliance was better with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin. levofloxacin reduced the bacterial infections and delays the onset of fever in chemotherapy-induced neutropenia especially in short duration (< 7 days). duration of more than a 39 degrees c fever was much longer in the nystatin group than in the norfloxacin group: bacteremia, microbiologically documented infections, and fever of unknown origin were more frequently seen in the nystatin group, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. adverse events possibly related to the study drugs were slightly more common among the patients receiving the combination treatment (p = 0.05). both sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and the combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim and ketoconazole substantially reduced the overall incidence of infection consequent to a marked decrease in bacterial infection. the use of therapeutic antibiotics was reduced (p = 0.013; 1-sided), with less hospitalizations due to fl (31 vs. 17 patients, p = 0.013: 1-sided). the number of gram-negative bacilli resistant to co-trimoxazole isolated from stools significantly increased during prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (p less than 0.001). children receiving tmp-smx had fewer episodes of bacteremia (0 vs. 5) and otitis media (3 vs. 18). this new combination antimicrobial regimen is safe and effective for prevention of gram-negative bacterial as well as fungal infections in patients with acute leukemia being treated with cytotoxic remission-induction chemotherapy. there were no significant differences between the two treatment groups in the time before the onset of the first fever, the number of episodes of fever or of septicaemia per patient, the number of neutropenic days during which patients remained afebrile or did not require systemic antibiotics, or the number of resistant organisms acquired. both aerobic gram-negative rods and streptococci which caused infection despite cotrimoxazole prophylaxis were resistant to cotrimoxazole. although the frequency of oral thrush was greater (p = .02) in the trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole group (25.6%) than in the placebo group (6.3%), invasive fungal infection did not occur. ciprofloxacin was therefore superior to the other two fluoroquinolones in preventing infections due to gram-negative bacteria in this population of neutropenic patients. adverse reactions associated with co-trimoxazole/colistin required discontinuation of medication in 11/27 treatment courses because of compliance problems, skin reactions or gastrointestinal intolerance. prophylactic trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole did not significantly reduce the incidence of fever, hospitalization, or infection in granulocytopenic patients during consolidation chemotherapy. acquisition of gram-negative bacilli was more frequent among patients treated with nalidixic acid plus nystatin while filamentous fungi were acquired more frequently by patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus nystatin (p = 0.05).|infections after chemotherapy-induced bone marrow aplasia immunocompromised patients one hundred and fifty-seven patients

vs 29.03%; (rr = 0.28; 95% ci 0.14-0.59). no differences or clear patterns were observed in the blood levels of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, and proteins between and within groups during gestation. calcium supplementation was associated with a significantly decreased risk of pregnancy-induced hypertension, with 4.1% developing pregnancy-induced hypertension in the treatment group versus 27.9% in the placebo group. the rates of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy were lower in the calcium group than in the placebo group (9.8 percent vs. 14.8 percent; odds ratio, 0.63; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.90). calcium did not reduce the numbers of preterm deliveries, small-for-gestational-age births, or fetal and neonatal deaths; nor did it increase urolithiasis during pregnancy. no major effect on pregnancy induced hypertension was seen (66% in placebo and 76% in calcium group developed hypertension) but the onset of hypertension was delayed 3 weeks in the calcium group. the neonatal mortality rate was lower (risk ratio, 0.70;

hemorrhoidal recurrence|postoperative pain at rest and during defecation was less important after pph if no resection of external piles or skin tags was associated (p < 0.0001). operation time for open hemorrhoidectomy using ligasure was shorter [median 13 (range 9.2-16.1) min vs 15 (range 8-17) minutes, p < 0.05]. stapled hemorrhoidopexy was not effective as a definitive cure for the symptoms of prolapse and itching in patients with fourth-degree hemorrhoids. the stapled group experienced significantly less pain (mean number of analgesic tablets 2.60 vs. 15.9) and returned to normal activity sooner (8.04 vs. 16.9 days), as reported by other authors. no significant difference was identified between the two groups in terms of operation time, blood loss, day of first bowel movement after surgery, and complication rates. impaired sphincter function was observed at 1 year with no significant difference between the groups for urgency (12%), continence problems (10%), or tenesmus (3%). closed hemorrhoidectomy proved to be superior for bleeding control (95.1 percent closed hemorrhoidectomy 80.5 percent stapled rectal mucosectomy; p= 0.04). stapled hemorrhoidectomy is a safe and effective day-care procedure for the treatment of grade iii and grade iv hemorrhoids. seven patients in the stapled group re-presented with prolapse compared with none in the conventional haemorrhoidectomy group (p = 0.004). postoperative pain was significantly lower in group b (p <0.001). stapled hemorrhoidectomy may be associated with less pain and faster recovery than conventional hemorrhoidectomy for prolapsing hemorrhoids. stapled hemorrhoidectomy offers several advantages over excision hemorrhoidectomy, including reduced postoperative pain, a reduced hospital stay, and an earlier recovery time. hemorrhoidectomy with a circular staple device is easy to perform and achieves better results than the milligan-morgan technique in terms of postoperative pain and recovery. in the early days after operation, patients in group 2 had greater difficulty in maintaining normal continence to liquid stools (p = 0.01), but after 30 days the continence score was better in group 2 (p = 0.04). at 1 year there were no significant differences in the symptom load, symptom severity or the disease severity between the two groups. primary end points were acute postoperative pain, and hemorrhoid symptom recurrence requiring additional treatment at one-year follow-up from surgery. stapled haemorrhoidectomy is an effective treatment for third degree haemorrhoids with significant advantages for patients compared with conventional haemorrhoidectomy. the stapled group had a shorter operating time, less frequent postoperative analgesia intake, shorter hospital stay and earlier return to normal activity. sh was superior to fh in operative time, intraoperative blood loss, postoperative pain intensity, and return to work. the circular transanal stapled technique for the treatment of haemorrhoids has the potential to offer a less painful rectal procedure in place of ablative perianal surgery.|patients with fourth-degree hemorrhoids mean age of patients was 46.02 years

patients receiving drug and placebo (52.8% vs. 55.8%, p=0.699). a significant decrease in luteinizing hormone was noted in the group given vitamin a compared with the placebo-treated group. supplementation of alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid attenuates the ribavirin-induced decrease of epa in erythrocyte membrane phospholipids in chronic hepatitis c patients. at the end of the hospital stay, serum indicators were significantly improved in the supplement group as compared to the placebo group for vitamin c, alpha-tocopherol, beta-carotene, zinc and selenium; conversely, lycopene changes were higher in the placebo group than in supplement group. in part ii of the trial, oral administration of antioxidants was not associated with significant alterations in any of the end points. ascorbic acid reverts endothelial dysfunction in other vascular disorders, via the increase of no bioavailability through the neutralization of superoxide anions, thus preventing the scavenging of no by superoxide. oral supplementation significantly increased serum vitamin e levels in the experimental group. small improvements in fisk scores were recorded during placebo therapy (median improvement, 4; p = 0.03). four-year animal studies showed that dietary supplement of se reduced the hbv infection by 77.2% and liver precancerous lesion by 75.8% of ducks, caused by exposure

95% ci, 0.19-0.89; p = 0.024). hiv risky behaviors and health practices were examined among young people living with hiv (yplh) in los angeles, san francisco, and new york over 15 months in response to receiving a preventive intervention. donors randomized to the structured intervention program did not report significantly more behavior change at the 1-year follow-up. statistically significant differences in retention (f(3,158)=3.78, p<.02), in longest period of consecutive urine samples negative for methamphetamine metabolites (f(3,158)=11.80, p<.001), and in the treatment effectiveness score were observed by condition during treatment (f(3,158)=7.35, p<.001) with post hoc analyses showing the cm and cbt+cm conditions to perform better than standard cbt. testing behavioral interventions to increase safer sex practices of hiv+ individuals has the potential to significantly reduce the number of new infections. subsequent to the "stay healthy" module, number of positive lifestyle changes and active coping styles increased more often among females who attended the intervention condition than among those in the control condition. in sessions providing skills training, condom use increased, on average, by 44% between pre-test and second follow-up compared with only 11% on average in sessions which did not provide such training. in both conditions, a significant decrease occurred in a range of problems from intake to the 6-month interview, followed by no significant pattern of change at 12- and 18-month interviews. the percentage who engaged in ui with multiple partners reduced from 31.5 to 12.9% (p = 0.02). no significant changes occurred in the comparison community over the same period. significant differences in sexual health behaviours were observed across locations and across time, but the only significant intervention effects were amongst men who had direct contact with the intervention, with higher uptake of hepatitis b vaccination and hiv testing. analyses indicated significant reductions in paid, unprotected sexual intercourse and oral sex following the intervention. compared to those randomized to a wait list control, treatment subjects reported significantly fewer sexual partners in the prior month at post-test (1.10 vs 2.29 for controls). we describe the intervention tested in explore, an hiv prevention trial aimed at men who have sex with men (msm), and test the empirical basis of the individually tailored intervention. participants in the triple session intervention greatly reduced their frequency of unprotected anal intercourse (from 46 to 20%) at the 12-month follow-up evaluation and (from 45% to 20%) at the 18-month follow-up evaluation. the opinion leaders acquired social skills for making these endorsements and complied in talking frequently with friends and acquaintances. relative to the comparison group, both the cognitive-behavioral and social support group therapies produced reductions in depression, hostility, and somatization. risk reduction in the pcc arm was sustained from 6 to 12 months at 1.9 (p = 0.181), whereas risk significantly decreased in the uc arm to 2.2 during this interval (p < 0.001 vs. 6 months; p = 0.756 vs. pcc at 12 months). compared with the standard intervention, fewer men assigned to the enhanced intervention reported unprotected receptive anal intercourse with a negative or unknown-serostatus partner at 3 months (21 versus 26%, p < 0.05). at the time of this writing, no randomized controlled trial (rct) of an intervention to reduce unsafe sex among latino gay and bisexual men (lgbm) had been published. although levels of risk within each wave were never significantly different between the two treatment groups, reductions in unprotected anal intercourse (uai) with a nonmonogamous partner for both groups from the baseline wave-1 levels were uniformly significant (all p's < .05). a novel counseling intervention focusing on self-justifications significantly decreased the proportion of participants reporting uai with nonprimary partners of unknown or discordant hiv status at 6 and 12 months (from 66% to 21% at 6 months and to 26% at 12 months, p =.002; p <.001) as compared with a control group when added to standard client-centered hiv counseling and testing. at eight weeks, those attending the group reported significant gains over their control in making sexual choices, physical safety, hiv and sti transmission knowledge, and sexual negotiation skills. among participants who had two or more sex partners at baseline, uav was reduced 38% (p < 0.001) among those who received the loss-frame intervention. population-level of risk behaviour decreased significantly in the intervention cities compared with the control cities at 1-year follow-up, after exclusion of surveys completed by transients and men with exclusive sexual partners in a city-level analysis, in the intervention cities we found a reduction in the mean frequency of unprotected anal intercourse during the previous 2 months (baseline 1.68 occasions; follow-up 0.59: p = 0.04) and an increase in the mean percentage of occasions of anal intercourse protected by condoms (baseline 44.7%; follow-up 66.8%, p = 0.02). the intervention to reduce risk of hiv transmission resulted in significantly less unprotected intercourse and greater condom use at follow-up. in the post-intervention period, the 3 groups did not differ in the incidence of sexual activity or in the proportion who slipped up at least once, but the self-justifications group were less likely to have had multiple slip-ups. after 4 weeks, they were allocated to one of 3 conditions: specific encounter (detailed reconstruction of a slip-up, but without any questions about self-justifications); posters (examination of posters, specially designed for the study, that focused on self-justifications); and control (no intervention). at the community level, movement toward consistent condom use with main (p < .05) and nonmain (p < .05) partners, as well as increased condom carrying (p < .0001), was greater in intervention than in comparison communities. cognitive behavioral intervention programs can effectively reduce the potential of hiv transmission to others among plh who report significant transmission risk behavior. this behavioural intervention was acceptable and feasible to deliver, but it did not reduce the risk of acquiring a new sexually transmitted infection among these gay men at high risk.|popular homosexual men in the community and trained them to spread behaviour-change endorsements and recommendations to their peers through conversation participants were recruited in los angeles, milwaukee, new york, and san francisco homosexual api gay men in the uk depressed persons with hiv infection people living with hiv young gay men persons with hiv disease gay men at homosexual and bisexual men 64 gay men infected with human immunodeficiency virus (hiv participants were men from each city who went to gay bars 271 hiv-infected persons who donated blood to the new york blood center hiv-positive men and women participants were 248 msm with a history of at least one previous negative hiv test result and self-reported uai (receptive or insertive) in the previous 12 months with partners of unknown or discordant hiv status men with hiv participants (n = 318) were recruited from bars, bathhouses, and erotic bookstores, and through homosexual african-american organizations, street out-reach, media advertisements, and personal referrals of individuals aware of the study men who have sex with men male prostitutes and other patrons in new york city "hustler" bars hiv-positive people latino gay and bisexual men men (n = 109) who had 'slipped up' (broken their safe sex rules by having unprotected anal intercourse) kept diaries of their sexual behaviour for 16 weeks six hiv clinics in california hiv-negative men sexual health clinic in london homosexual asian and pacific islander men new york city in which 180 lgbm 343 gay men with an acute sexually transmitted infection or who reported having had unprotected anal intercourse in the past year fifty-two msm social networks were recruited through access points in high-risk community venues hiv (human immunodeficiency virus) infection urban sample of men at high risk for hiv infection this community-based rct recruited 50 men, of whom 42% were hiv-positive or untested, and 32% reported status unknown or serodiscordant uai in the previous 12 months 329 self-identified homosexual api recruited in san francisco between 1992 and 1994 yplh aged 16 to 29 years (n = 175;

95% ci: 0.18, 0.56). each field center developed its own intervention(s) and corresponding control, and tailored its study to the specific hypothesis being tested. however, for the majority of outcome variables, differences between intervention and control schools at postintervention and follow-up were not statistically significant. significant improvements in nutrition knowledge were seen in all children (p<0.01) between baseline and post-intervention, and results were highly significant in the nutrition and combined group (p<0.001). girls in control schools had significant increases in percentage of risk of overweight or overweight from third (26%) to fifth (39%) grades, as did girls in catch schools (30%-32%); however, the rate of increase for girls in the catch schools was significantly lower (2%) compared with the rate for control girls (13%). results showed significant differences between the treatment and control mothers for daily saturated fat intake and percentage of calories from fat. after two years, there was a trend for the children exposed to the pe intervention to have lower levels of body fat, but the differences were not significant. overall results at the end of the 12-week program demonstrated substantial, although not significant, differences between treatment and control groups in the hypothesized directions. the effect sizes of the differences between treatment and control groups ranged between small (cohen's d = 0.15 for body mass index at 6 months post-intervention) to large (1.38; parent report of screen time at 6 months post-intervention), controlling for baseline levels. the group by time interactions were significant for fitness (p < 0.01) and %bf (p < 0.05). total energy intake (by 24-h dietary recall) was significantly reduced in the intervention schools but energy intake (by direct observation) was not. schools with > or =75 min of physical activity across the curriculum/wk showed significantly less increase in body mass index at 3 years compared to schools that had <75 min of physical activity across the curriculum parental involvement did not increase intervention effects. in a 2-y intervention targeting increased physical activity and healthy eating in primary school children, the adjusted body mass index (bmi) z score was 0.26 units (95% ci: 0.21, 0.32) lower in intervention than in control children. eating habits at home were found to be healthier among families with children in intervention schools at the end of the intervention. positive effect on adiposity indices (except tsf) was observed in boys (p<0.001 for bmi z), while both physical fitness parameters increased significantly in both boys (p<0.001 for each test) and girls (p<0.0001 for each test). compared with controls, participants in the intervention groups achieved their nutritional targets for fat intake and to a smaller extent for sugar and complex carbohydrate intake, leading to a decrease in energy intake (children, p < .001; parents, p = .02). no differences in self-reported pa emerged between the intervention and control groups at weeks 1 (baseline) and 12 (postintervention). a multicomponent school-based intervention can be effective in preventing the development of overweight among children in grades 4 through 6 in urban public schools with a high proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-priced school meals. interventions aimed to improve health-related behaviours had significant effects on the age-dependent increases in median triceps skinfolds of the whole group (from 10.9 to 11.3 mm in "intervention schools" vs from 10.7 to 13.0 mm in "control schools", p<0.01) as well as in percentage fat mass of overweight children (increase by 3.6 vs 0.4% per year without and with intervention, respectively; p<0.05). multilevel analyses showed that the intervention remained effective in preventing unfavorable increases in important measures of body composition after 20-month follow-up in girls (biceps skinfold and sum of 4 skinfolds) and boys (triceps, biceps, and subscapular skinfolds). intervention children showed a higher score for knowledge, attitudes, and self reported behaviour for healthy eating and physical activity. at follow-up, 45% of girls in the intervention schools and 36% of girls in the control schools reported vigorous physical activity during an average of 1 or more 30-minute time blocks per day over a 3-day period. intervention children had significantly smaller increases in bmi compared with control children at 1-year follow-up, 0.06 vs 0.59 kg/m 2 ; difference -0.53 kg/m 2 after intervention, prevalence of overweight, bmi z-score and change in bmi z-score were significantly lower in intervention groups compared with controls in underprivileged areas. scores on the restriction subscale of the child feeding questionnaire decreased significantly in the opps condition (-0.22+/- 0.42 vs. 0.08+/- 0.63, p < 0.05), indicating that mothers in the opps group were engaging in less restrictive child feeding practices over time. consumption of ssbs decreased by 82% in the intervention group and did not change in the control group. following the program champion-directed intervention, girls in intervention schools were more physically active than girls in control schools (mean difference 10.9 met-weighted minutes of mvpa, 95% ci=0.52-21.2). children from intervention schools spent less time on screen-viewing activities after the intervention but these differences were imprecisely estimated: mean difference in minutes spent on screen viewing at the end of the intervention (intervention schools minus control schools) adjusted for baseline levels and clustering within schools was -11.6 cross-sectional comparisons at baseline indicated lower physical activity, self-efficacy for physical activity and aerobic fitness and a higher bmi in children with high screen time. int children had a 20% greater increase in fitness and a 5.7% smaller increase in bp compared with children attending up schools (p<0.05). in addition, girls in the active intervention groups reduced their consumption of sweetened beverages by 34%, increased their level of moderate-to-vigorous activity by 12%, and increased their serving; of water by 1.5%. parents in the increased fruit and vegetable group showed significantly greater decreases in percentage of overweight than parents in the decreased high-fat/high-sugar group. no changes in total cholesterol, triglycerides or blood pressure were associated with the intervention in either sex, except for an increase in diastolic blood pressure (1.55 mm hg; 95% ci 0.19-2.91; p=0.03) in the intervention versus control boys. the diminution of insulin levels was more significant in the overweight group (p < 0.007). children playing kalèdo showed a significant increase in nutrition knowledge (p<0.05) and in weekly vegetable intake (p<0.01) with respect to the control. percentage of adolescents meeting recommended health guidelines was significantly improved for girls for consumption of saturated fat (intervention vs control change, 23.4% to 41.0% vs 18.5% to 31%, respectively [relative risk, 1.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.68]) and for boys' participation in d/wk of pa (intervention vs control change, 45.3% to 55.4% vs 41.9% to 38.0%, respectively [relative risk, 1.47; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-1.75]). group allocation had no significant effect on the primary outcome measure at six and 12 months or on measures of physical activity and sedentary behaviour by accelerometry. the treatment group reported significantly reduced household television viewing (d = .73, p = .007) and fewer dinners eaten while watching tv (adjusted difference = -1.60 meals/week, 95% ci -2.99, -.21; d = .59; p = .03). analysis of post-data shows significant positive shifts (p = 0.01) in bmi in the intervention group compared with the comparison group. the percentage of children watching television/videos more than 2 h/d also decreased significantly from 33% to 18% among the intervention group, compared with an increase of 41% to 47% among the control group, for a difference of -21.5% (95% confidence interval, -42.5% to -0.5%; p =.046). intervention students had a lower increase in bmi (p=0.01) and age- and gender-adjusted bmi (p<0.02) over time than controls. no significant differences between groups were found for bmi. the intervention group significantly (p = 0.013) reduced its intake of artificial juice, which is prohibited by the act. the intervention had positive, significant effects on percentage bmi-for-age and percentage body fat for target children and weight, bmi, and percentage body fat for parents. this study population stabilized their bmi sds (p < 0.025). in contrast, in boys only bmi z-score (p < 0.001) and fat-free mass (p < 0.001) were affected. there were no significant differences between intervention and control schools in either primary or secondary outcomes at post-intervention, year 1, or year 2 follow-ups. children in the bm/fms group were less likely than controls to be overweight/obese between baseline and post intervention (adjusted odds ratio (aor)=0.36, p<0.05); also maintained at 12-month follow-up (aor=0.38, p<0.05). building community capacity to promote healthy eating and physical activity appears to be a safe and effective way to reduce unhealthy weight gain in children without increasing health inequalities.|10 primary schools in leeds 59 children of the intervention group opted for a participation and 49 of them took part to the end of the study children aged 5-7 years (n=213) were recruited from three primary schools in oxford low-income elementary schools with primarily hispanic students from 1996 to 1999 a representative group of 2440 5 to 7-y-old children was recruited (ie 30.2% of the total population of 5 to 7-y-old children examined by the school physicians) and a full data set was obtained from 1640 children 1044 children, mean age 9.4 years (s.d.=0.7) at baseline, of the province of cuenca, spain 425 children in 14 primary schools (2 weekly pa sessions of 1 h each) compared to 5 control schools children (aged 4-12 years) in the australian town of colac colac children in four preschools and six primary schools at baseline (2003, n=1001, response rate: 58%) and follow-up (2006 african american women families (n = 105) with at least one 8- to 12-year-old child who was at-risk-for-overweight or overweight (designated as the target child) were recruited for the study african american mothers and daughters children without increasing health inequalities adolescent boys boys and girls (n=268, age 9-11 years children through community capacity-building students overweight in 6 to 10-year-old children adolescent girls overweight among children in grades 4 through 6 in urban public schools with a high proportion of children eligible for free and reduced-priced school meals subjects:nine hundred and fifty four 12-year-old six-graders 103 adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who regularly consumed ssbs to intervention and control groups families with obese parents and non-obese children control school children preschool minority children participants included 679 children in year 5 (age 9-10 19 primary schools in south west england children (23 males) were 22 overweight in adolescents 15 schools with seventh and eight graders 10-year-old children elementary-school children community centers in memphis, tennessee middle school children free-living children and parents 1108 adolescents (mean age, 12.7 years 153 children from 8 classrooms (11-14 year old caucasian subjects;

nebulizer in the delivery of albuterol to young children with moderate and severe acute asthma. with the exception of heart rate (which increased in the nebulizer group and decreased in the mdi-spacer group (p < 0.05), no difference in the rate of improvement of clinical score, respiratory rate, arterial oxygen saturation, or fev1 was noted during the 40-minute study period between children who received albuterol by nebulizer and those who received it by mdi-spacer. no significant difference was found in the mean baseline clinical score among the three groups, and a significant decline occurred in the mean clinical scores in all groups by 15 minutes which was maintained to 60 minutes after the dose was administered. the baseline data of the two groups were not significantly different. the 6-h area under the curve fev1 improved similarly with the three delivery methods despite differences in the total dose administered. there was no detectable difference in effectiveness of albuterol administered by nebulizer or the inhaler system for treatment of acute asthma. large volume spacers are an acceptable, cost effective alternative to nebulisers in treating children admitted with acute asthma, provided that the children can use the mouthpiece, and symptoms are not severe. pefr increased significantly in both the groups after completion of treatment, but pefr was not statistically significant when compared in between groups. during the asthma attacks, the odn group needed a prolonged observation in the emergency room (p = 0.000000). the cost of treatment was higher for the nebulizer and commercially available spacer (p = 0.0001). mdi-spacer is as effective as a nebulizer for the aerosolized administration of salbutamol in an acute exacerbation of asthma in children. albuterol by metered dose inhaler provided similar bronchodilation to that achieved by wet nebulization in patients with acute asthma. the improvement from baseline at 30 min in the clinical score was 1.87 for jn and 1.43 for pmdi (p=0.09) and at 60 min was 2.15 for jn and 1.12 for pmdi (p=0.0001). additionally, the neb group presented a higher incidence of tremor (p=.03) and anxiety (p=.04), reflecting larger systemic absorption of salbutamol. there was no significant outcome difference between the two treatments in either diagnostic group. there were no differences between groups in the score over time, or secondary outcome measures. less than 10% of the children (3 in each group) required hospitalization (2 in each group attributable to treatment failure). no difference in bronchodilation was obvious between the methods of treatment. both nebulizer regimens resulted in significant improvements in both fvc and fev1 by 30 min after initial hospital beta-agonist treatment. all three treatment groups showed significant improvement following albuterol therapy in both percent predicted respiratory rate and percent predicted pefr. fewer patients in the spacer group had episodes of vomiting in the ed (9% vs 20%, p < .04), and patients in the nebulizer group had a significantly greater mean percent increase in heart rate from baseline to final disposition (15% vs 5%, p < .001). the mean percentage of improvement in fvc and fev1 in the a group was 33.5 and 49.0 percent, respectively. no significant difference in bronchodilation was seen between groups a and b. fenoterol through a spacer can replace inhalation in adult asthma patients with non-severe obstruction.|hospitalized asthmatic patients thirty-five patients 10 to 45 years of

radiographic signs of loosening|patients with both partial and full-thickness rotator cuff tears had significant improvements in terms of overall pain (p < 0.05) and satisfaction (p < 0.05). preoperative and postoperative scores of the rheumatoid group were not significantly different from the arthritis group (p<0.001). there were satisfactory improvements in the mean range of active elevation (53 degrees to 75 degrees) and external rotation (5 degrees to 38 degrees); satisfactory performance of the activities of daily living had been maintained throughout follow-up. there was not a significant difference in improvement in pain and motion comparing hemiarthroplasty and tsa for patients with a thin or torn rotator cuff. in spite of the use of an uncemented humeral stem, no implant was radiologically loose or at risk. the constant score improved from a mean of 17 points (range 4 to 25) preoperatively to a mean of 63 points (range 41 to 79) at a mean of 54 months (range 48 to 73) after shoulder arthroplasty. the average rotation for all axes was less than 0.25 degrees for both groups and the average translation was less than 0.32 mm for all three axes including subsidence, which was less than 0.1 mm for the uncemented stems. final clinical scores (hospital for special surgery scoring system) and the incidence of radiolucency and upward migration of shoulder components in 20 shoulders with rotator cuff repair by augmented subscapularis transposition were superior to those of 19 shoulders with cuff repair by subscapularis transposition alone and similar to those of 22 shoulders with intact rotator cuffs. dislocation occurred earlier than other causes of revision or complication (p < .05, analysis of variance). patients with ra who had a total shoulder arthroplasty scored higher than patients with hemiarthroplasty. the clinical score of the shoulders with good repair of the rotator cuff improved considerably and continued to improve even after the first-year follow-up examination. radiographical analysis revealed evidence of lucencies about the humeral component in all cases and about the glenoid component in five cases. satisfactory pain relief was achieved in 44 (66%) and 52 of the shoulders (78%) were described by patients as being much better or better. for the collapse-type shoulders, we could not obtain pain relief or rom improvement with arthroscopic synovectomy, but did obtain pain relief with prosthetic replacement. constant scores for the whole group improved from a mean preoperative score of 16.4 (range, 8-36) to 54.0 (range, 20-83) at last follow-up (p < .05). glenoid component loosening was the main factor of prosthesis failure in both prostheses and mainly occurred in the first 4 postoperative years. the mean range of active flexion improved from 50 degrees in the hemiarthroplasty group and 47 degrees in the total shoulder replacement group to 101 degrees and 104 degrees, respectively. active abduction improved by an average of 40 degrees to an average of 117 degrees. motion did not improve in either group. over the five-year follow-up period, proximal migration of the cup increased in 63% of the shoulders, and the glenoid depth increased in 31%. also, component loosening did not significantly influence the average pain relief, range of movement, abduction force, or function. proximal migration and glenoid erosion did not correlate with shoulder function or pain.|22 shoulder implant arthroplasties in 19 patients age 50 or younger at surgery 16 shoulders with underlying ra that

estimated catheter survival without mechanical failure was found to be similar in the two groups: midline (59%) and lateral (51%), (0.4 less than p less than 0.5). there was no significant difference between catheters with single or double cuffs with respect to catheter survival, episodes of peritonitis and exit-site infections. moreover, peritoneoscopically placed catheters were found to have better survival (77.5% at 12 months, 63% at 24 months, and 51.3% at 36 months) than those placed surgically (62.5% at 12 months, 41.5% at 24 months, and 36% at 36 months) with p = 0.02, 0.01, and

development fetal size fat intake average weight retention maternal carbohydrate intake and pregnancy outcome neonatal birthweight|women in the exercise group were approximately 5 times more likely than those in the control group to have regular or good cardiorespiratory capacity (12/38 versus 2/38; relative risk 5.2, 95% confidence interval 1.2 to 22.0, number needed to treat 5). the offspring of the women who were randomly assigned to a high volume of exercise in mid and late pregnancy were significantly lighter (3.39 kg vs 3.81 kg) and thinner (8.3% fat vs 12.1% fat) than those offspring born of women who were randomly assigned to reduce their exercise volume after the 20th week. better glucose tolerance in the diet/probiotics group was confirmed by a reduced risk of elevated glucose concentration compared with the control/placebo group (or 0.31 (95 % ci 0.12, 0.78); p = 0.013) as well as by the lowest insulin concentration (adjusted means 7.55, 9.32 and 9.27 mu/l; p = 0.032) and homeostasis model assessment (adjusted means 1.49, 1.90 and 1.88; p = 0.028) and the highest quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (adjusted means 0.37, 0.35 and 0.35; p = 0.028) during the last trimester of pregnancy. dietary counseling was effective in decreasing the weight gain of pregnant women who were overweight and reducing clinical complications, such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, infant low weight, and prematurity in the intervention group. fat intake, specifically saturated fat intake, decreased and protein intake increased from the first to the third trimester in the passive and active groups compared with an opposite change in the control group. nutrition knowledge improved significantly over time in both groups but more so in the video doctor group. omnibus manova showed statistically significant differences between the study and control groups regarding 3 variables: (1) gestational hypertension, p < .46; (2) mother's last weight before delivery, p < .001; and (3) mother's 6-week postpartum weight, p < .001. there were no significant differences in birth weight z score or other measures of infant adiposity between groups. no statistically significant differences were noted between the groups in adherence to iom guidelines, rate of cesarean delivery, preeclampsia, gdm, operative vaginal delivery, or vaginal lacerations. thus, altering the source of maternal dietary carbohydrate may prove to be a valuable tool in the management of pregnancies at risk for anomalous feto-placental growth and for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity and insulin resistance in the non-pregnant state. finally, urine ketones increased significantly (p less than 0.02) in the calorie-restricted group, whereas they remained absent in the control group.(abstract truncated at 250 words) both s-insulin and s-leptin were reduced by 20% in the intervention group compared to the control group at week 27, mean difference: -16 pmol l(-1) a low-intensity behavioral intervention during pregnancy reduced excessive gestational weight gains in nw women and prevented postpartum weight retention in nw and ow/ob women. neonatal birthweight was lower in the intervention than in the usual care group (absolute effect size -133 g, 95% ci -231 to -35, p = 0.008) as was proportion of large-for-gestational-age (lga) newborns (26/216, 12.1% versus 34/179, 19.7%, p = 0.042). a low-glycemic index diet is effective as a treatment for individuals with diabetes and has been shown to improve pregnancy outcomes when used from the first trimester. fat content and daily caloric content of participants in the control group were significantly higher than the experimental group. the intervention was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of gestational diabetes (6 versus 29%, or 0.17 95% ci 0.03-0.95, p = 0.04). however, insulin resistance (homa-ir) did not differ between the groups. average gestational weight gain was 14.02, 15.27 and 16.22 kg in the three ep, epp and comparison groups respectively, and average weight retention at six months post partum was 2.34, 4.06 and 5.08 kg in the three groups, respectively. the mean diet gi fell significantly in the lgi group but not in the hgi group. significant differences (p = .03) were found between study groups in the percentage of women who perceived their health status as "very good"; the values that corresponded to the exercise group (n = 18; 54.5%) were better than those of the control group (n = 9; 27.3%). the values of the ogtt during the second trimester did not differ between the lifestyle intervention and close follow-up groups. energy restriction did not alter the frequency of insulin therapy (17.5% in the intervention group and 16.9% in the control group). the intervention significantly decreased the percentage of normal-weight women who exceeded the iom recommendations (33 vs 58%, p<0.05). regular weight measurement in pregnancy was not

with rhepo experienced a significantly longer time to first erythrocyte transfusion than the control group and were less likely to experience nadir haemoglobin levels < 10 g/dl (p < 0.001 and < 0.05, respectively). there was a significant improvement in overall quality of life between the two treatment arms in favor of the r-huepo-treated group. the mean change in hb from baseline was significantly (p<0.001) greater for epoetin alfa than bst patients at all post-baseline evaluations. patients receiving darbepoetin alfa required fewer transfusions (27% versus 52%; mean difference =

addition, there was a nonsignificant trend toward higher plt counts and fewer plt transfusions in patients who received r-hu-epo. darbepoetin alfa also resulted in higher mean changes in haemoglobin than placebo from baseline to the last value during the treatment phase (1.80 g/dl vs 0.19 g/dl) and after 12 weeks of treatment (2.66 g/dl vs 0.69 g/dl). epoetin alfa, compared with placebo, significantly decreased transfusion requirements (p =.0057) and increased hemoglobin (p <.001). univariate analysis showed significant (p </= 0.05) improvement in more qol measures with epoetin alfa than with placebo; multivariate analysis discerned no between-treatment differences. multivariate regression analysis showed that relative erythropoietin concentration was the most important factor and the platelet count had no additional influence on response. transfusion incidence (weeks 5-12) was significantly lower for darbepoetin alfa patients (8%) than for observation patients (22%) (p =

vvi and ddd modes maximal atrial rates|exercise performance and borg scores were significantly worse during vvi pacing compared with vvir or ddd pacing but did not significantly differ between vvir and ddd modes. the patients reported significantly less breathlessness, fatigue, and dizziness and a significantly greater sense of general well-being during ddd pacing than during vvi pacing. quality of life improved significantly after pacemaker implantation (p<0.001), but there were no differences between the two pacing modes in either the quality of life or prespecified clinical outcomes (including cardiovascular events or death). the observed annual rates of death from all causes and of hospitalization for heart failure were lower among the patients with a physiologic pacemaker than among those with a ventricular pacemaker, but not significantly so (annual rates of death, 6.6 percent with ventricular pacing and 6.3 percent with physiologic pacing; annual rates of hospitalization for heart failure, 3.5 percent and 3.1 percent, respectively). there was significantly less chest pain with this mode than with either of the other modes. perceived general well-being and exercise capacity (p less than 0.01) and treadmill times (p less than 0.05) were improved in ddd mode but vvi and ddi modes were similar. 2.2 liters/min, p = 0.0001) where significantly greater in the ddd mode. comparing the different pacing modalities, there was an increase in the incidence of stroke in patients receiving ventricular pacing (p < 0.05). paced ventricular rate was, however, higher and variation in paced rate greater in ddd compared to vvi,r pacing. the most highly significant (p less than 0.005) were shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, pulsations in the neck or abdomen, cough, and apprehension. arterial lactate, respiratory rates and perceived exertion ratings during submaximal levels of exercise were higher on ventricular inhibited pacing, as well as symptoms scored during the two 3-week periods. overall quality-of-life and cardiovascular symptoms did not significantly differ, though three patients felt discomfort during vvir mode. no significant difference was found in the ability to climb stairs but there was a marked improvement in the symptomatic questionnaire score, 19 +/- a semiquantitative score scale was used to quantify the symptoms of general well-being, palpitations, dizziness, pulsating sensation in the neck or abdomen, shortness of breath at rest and during effort, chest pain, and nyha classification. maximal symptom limited exercise in those with atrioventricular block was significantly higher after one month of ddd pacing than after vvi pacing. patient-perceived well-being was significantly better with dm than with dr mode (dm 69, dr 60, p = 0.02). ventricular demand pacing in elderly patients with complete heart block is associated with higher symptom scores, reduced exercise ability and greater perceived exercise difficulty compared with dual-chamber pacing. no significant differences were identified between pacing modes in symptom scores for dyspnoea, fatigue, and mood disturbance; exercise time; and maximal oxygen consumption. the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide was significantly lower in dddr mode (p=0 x 002). significant improvement in the mean total quality-of-life score (20.5 +/- variability of left and right atrial and left ventricular bloodflow was studied using transthoracic and transesophageal doppler echocardiography and related to pacemaker mode preference during everyday activity. in sinus-node dysfunction, dual-chamber pacing does not improve stroke-free survival, as compared with ventricular pacing. despite similar heart rate changes during acute physiological stresses, a higher blood pressure was recorded during aair or dddr pacing compared with vvir pacing. symptomatic assessment (by diary card and monthly symptom scores) of "shortness of breath", "palpitation", and "general well-being" was significantly improved during the physiological pacing mode. perceived "general well-being," exercise capacity, functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the vvir than
