however, severe hematological toxicity was seldom observed. the response duration for patients with measurable disease (median 14.6 versus 8.8 months), progression-free interval for all patients (13.1 versus 7.7 months), and survival for patients with measurable disease (19.7 versus 15.7 months) showed a statistically significant advantage for cap; however, there was no difference in survival of patients with nonmeasurable disease. failure to achieve a significant degree of leucopenia was associated with worse progression free survival (p less than 0.001). the complete and partial response rates were 45.6% in the cap arm and 45.4% in the ca arm, but the cap regimen is of special importance in patients with bulky disease. the extent of initial surgery significantly affected the survival of patients receiving prednimustine but not of those receiving combination chemotherapy. there was less thrombocytopenia on the cisplatin arm (p less than .001); however, there was less nausea and emesis (p less than or equal to .001 for courses 1 to 5), renal toxicity (p less than .001), anemia (p = .01), hearing loss (p less than .001), tinnitus (p = .01), neuromuscular toxicities (p = .001), and alopecia (p less than .001) on the carboplatin arm. there was a strong trend for better survival in stage iii (p less than .05) but not in stage iv patients treated with cisplatin alone. this response rate was not enhanced by the addition of fu or fu and ac and not substantially different than the response rate of ac, fu, and cy. crossover due to toxicity was more frequent in the cisplatin than the carboplatin arm, occurring in 50% and 3.3% of patients, respectively. in 1982 a randomized trial was started to compare a cisplatin-containing polychemotherapy (cap: patients with stage iv measurable disease had a greater response rate to cmf, 22/52 (42%) versus l-pam, 6/39 (15%). no significant difference was observed between these two regimens in response rates, and no significant differences were noted between the two regimens in each of the clinical toxicities and abnormalities in laboratory findings. combination-agent chemotherapy produced a larger proportion of 48-month survivors than single-agent therapy (p = 0.001); 70% of these survivors were clinically free of disease. the incidence of side effects was significantly higher in the combination-treatment arm. no statistical difference in median survival was observed between single-drug treatment (12 months) and caf (14 months), despite the fact that responders lived significantly longer than nonresponders (17 vs 10 months). no statistically significant difference was found between the two treatments in terms of median survival. cell differentiation and volume of postoperative disease did not influence response. none of the other parameters showed a statistically significant advantage for combination chemotherapy, but the combinations caused more hematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity. following treatment crossover, the relative risk of death associated with original allocation to cbdca receded from 1.79 to 0.97, indicating success of the salvage treatment using the cddp-based regimen. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> ovarian cancer was conducted by a cooperative study group consisting of 22 institutions nationwide ovarian carcinoma 135 women with advanced ovarian carcinoma 24 patients still receiving 253 patients with advanced epithelial carcinoma of the ovary stage iii-iv ovarian carcinoma 149 patients between march 1985 and january 1987, 103 women with histologically proven stage iii-iv ovarian carcinoma 118 eligible patients initially treated with melphalan and 126 with chad 233 evaluable patients with measurable disease, there were 64 treated with twenty-three patients were excluded because of protocol violation, leaving 156 patients evaluable for survival with an observation period of 3-6 yr three hundred forty-two patients 44 patients undergoing advanced epithelial ovarian cancer 136 evaluable patients without measurable disease by progression-free interval and duration of survival patients with advanced ovarian cancer women with suboptimal (greater than or equal to 3 cm residual) stage iii, stage iv, and recurrent ovarian adenocarcinoma southwest oncology group of a phase iii randomized trial in stages iii and iv ovarian cancer patients who cannot be given advanced ovarian cancer patients with advanced or recurrent, stage iii and iv, ovarian epithelial carcinoma four hundred and twenty-seven patients were in the study, 314 of whom are evaluable for progression-free interval (pfi), survival, and toxicity: 102 in regimen 76 patients with advanced epithelial ovarian carcinoma patients with large (greater than 2 cm) residual disease patients with stage iii (suboptimal) and stage iv ovarian cancer advanced ovarian carcinoma advanced ovarian cancer (adovca stage iib patients patients with untreated advanced epithelial ovarian cancer after intensive staging 74 ovarian cancer patients twenty patients were in stage iib, while the remaining 136 patients were classified as stages iii and iv advanced ovarian cancer patients patients with ovarian carcinoma (figo stages iii and iv sixty-one patients with figo stage iii ovarian carcinoma and 30 patients with stage iv ovarian carcinoma four hundred twenty-nine patients were entered into four prospective randomized clinical studies between january 1, 1973, and july 1, 1979 264 eligible patients with advanced ovarian cancer one hundred seventy-three patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer, f.i.g.o.

asthma-free days, less frequent sensations of moderate to very severe, wheeziness and less effect on the evening peak flow rate. unlike propranolol and oxprenolol, which significantly reduced fev1 and inhibited the bronchodilator response to inhaled salbutamol, atenolol and celiprolol did not significantly affect respiratory function and did not antagonize salbutamol effects. bevantolol significantly decreased the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) and the peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) at rest, while there was no such change with placebo or atenolol. after administration of 200 mg in slow-release tablets the plasma levels were lower and the ventilatory effect was less marked. in contrast the 3 doses of atenolol caused significantly less (p less than 0.05 to 0.01) b2-blockade as evidenced by a smaller fall in fev1. both dilevalol and metoprolol similarly and significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) inhibited the isoproterenol (160 and 480 micrograms) response in fev1 as compared to placebo.(abstract truncated at 250 words) celiprolol 400 mg and 600 mg neither caused bronchoconstriction nor antagonized albuterol in this acute study. both beta-blockers, in all the doses given, caused a significant decrease in peak expiratory flow rate (pefr). both atenolol and metoprolol lowered resting heart rate and fev1 both beta-blockers reduced the basal forced expiratory volume in one second (fev1), and the effect tended to be more pronounced after propranolol. all active treatments produced only small nonsignificant reductions in pefr, fev1, and vc, compared with baseline, without any significant differences between the four groups. monthly asthma attacks increased by more than 100% in five patients on celiprolol and four on chlorthalidone. changes in one-second forced expiratory volume (fev1) and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (fef25-75) prior to albuterol or isoproterenol were positive after placebo and both doses of celiprolol. inhalation of terbutaline to a cumulative dose of 2.0 mg induced a stepwise improvement in expiratory airflow parameters for large and small airways function when breathing air. mean reduction in resting pulse rate was statisitcally greater after acebutolol compared with placebo but not after practolol compared with placebo. following salbutamol, labetalol was associated with a significantly greater improvement of airflow than either propranolol or metoprolol. in the remaining five patients, bronchoconstriction was greatest following propranolol (mean reduction in fev1 26.6%) and least following atenolol (mean reduction in fev1 6.5%). following each active drug, resting heart rate changed to a similar extent and to a greater degree than after placebo (p less than 0.01). metoprolol reduced heart rate by 14% (p less than 0.001) and ventilation by 11% (p less than 0.01), but there was no significant difference in arterial o2 or co2 tension (pao2 and paco2, respectively). responsiveness to beta-2 agonist therapy was retained with both agents (p less than 0.05). compared to placebo, metoprolol did not significantly affect fev1 or forced vital capacity. the effects of the three treatments on forced vital capacity (fvc) and maximal midexpiratory flow (mmef) were qualitatively similar to those observed in fev1. the median cumulative salbutamol concentrations causing a 35% increase in tremor were 732 and 706 micrograms for placebo, 812 and 1213 micrograms for metoprolol, and 797 and 1323 micrograms for atenolol.(abstract truncated at 250

hemodialysis/hemofiltration during uro or placebo infusion was significantly reduced (p = 0.03) in the uro-treated patients in comparison with placebo. the postoperative brain natriuretic peptide was significantly lower in the hanp group as compared with that in the non-hanp group until 1 year after the operation. patients with diabetes mellitus had a significantly greater incidence of rcin: placebo, 26% versus 9%; anaritide (0.01), 33% versus 13%; anaritide (0.05), 26% versus 21%; anaritide (0.1), 39% versus 8% (diabetic v nondiabetic, p < 0.002). anp levels rose significantly from baseline at 5, 15, 65 and 120 minutes in both groups (p less than 0.05). the incidence of postoperative ventricular arrhythmia and the postoperative peak level of creatine kinase-mb were significantly lower in the hanp group. the hanp group showed significantly higher levels of anp, cyclic guanosine monophosphate, glomerular filtration rate, and respiratory index, and significantly lower levels of renin, angiotensin-ii, aldosterone, and pleural effusion, as compared with the non-hanp group. postoperative creatinine clearance was higher in group h (p=0.03). urodilatin induced a rapid onset of diuresis in contrast to placebo-treated patients, who remained oliguric. the results indicate that ularitide does not reduce the incidence of mechanical renal replacement therapy compared with

statistically significant beneficial effect of anp in dialysis-free survival or reduction in dialysis in these subjects with oliguric acute renal failure. mean arterial blood pressure was stable during the urodilatin infusion period and was not different to that observed in placebo patients. the incidence of postoperative hemodialysis and the number of treatments did not differ between the

adjuncts in the treatment of spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. in the fourteen subjects who completed the trial there was a statistically significant decrease in resistance to passive stretch, clonus and hyperreflexia without significant reduction of muscle strength. there was not statistically significant superiority of either diazepam or ketazolam, but both relieved symptoms significantly better than the placebo, as measured clinically and by electromyographic recording of deep tendon reflexes. pain relief associated with both thc and cbd was significantly superior to placebo. as to the residual urinary volume, no relevant differences and alterations were determinated in the course of the treatment as well. both thc and plant-extract treatment worsened the participant's global impression. tizanidine and baclofen improved the functional status of patients in 80% and 76% of cases, respectively, but there were no significant differences between the two drugs. we found no toxic effects on hepatologic, hematopoietic, or renal function, acutely or for over 3 years of follow-up. patient self-evaluation results also showed a significant reduction in clonus. overall, treatment with baclofen alone significantly improved moderate quadriceps spasticity as measured by cybex flexion scores. in contrast, muscle strength, bladder function and the activities of daily living were more improved on tizanidine than on baclofen. the total number and severity of side-effects were equal in the two treatment groups. tizanidine produced a significantly greater reduction than placebo in spasms and clonus (patient diaries) but no significant differences in ashworth scores. we found that botulinum toxin produced a significant reduction in spasticity (p = 0.009) and a significant improvement in the ease of nursing care (p = 0.009). both drugs reduced the findings of spasticity, clonus, and hyperreflexia, and the complaints of muscle stiffness and cramping. a statistically significant benefit was noted in spastic muscle groups in the legs with concomitant significant reduction in hyperactive stretch reflexes and ankle clonus. while on baclofen, patients obtained a significant (p less than 0.001) reduction in spasticity compared to controls. tizanidine had a mild depressive effect on blood pressure. levels of threonine were elevated in serum and cerebrospinal fluid during treatment, but glycine levels did not change. this double-blind cross-over study of 14 severely spastic inpatients with chronic multiple sclerosis reveals that once-daily doses of ketazolam, a new drug, are effective in reducing spasticity in a significant proportion of patients without significant side-effects. in the spasticity group, botulinum toxin a reduced the tone of all patients significantly, improved functionality and nursing care in eight of 12 patients, and alleviated painful spasms in five of five patients. <INPUT_END>

in the indian population. leflunomide and methotrexate treatment improved measures of physical function and health-related quality of life significantly more than placebo (p<.001 and p<.05, respectively). the incidence of side reactions was lower in lef group (17.86%) than in mtx group (40.00%, p < 0.05). adverse events (aes) resulting in treatment withdrawal were higher in the 10 mg

treatment resulted in a marked reduction in bone pain, with no progression of radiologic skeletal lesions during the first year. serum calcium and urinary calcium excretion decreased significantly in both groups, but the changes were greater in the clodronate group. there were no adverse effects other than transient diarrhea in some patients. reduction in bone pain was accompanied by decreases in urinary calcium/creatinine and hydroxyproline/creatinine ratios, and bone alkaline phosphatase concentrations. analgesics requirement increased in both groups, but significantly more in patients receiving placebo (p = 0.042), in whom increase in opioid requirements was particularly evident. unlike the controls, the patients who received cl2mdp presented a significant reduction in urinary calcium (p = 0.003) and in hydroxyproline (p = 0.05) on the 7th day. the results do not support the superiority of combined intravenous and oral treatment with clodronate compared with oral administration only. the average change in dmed was -6.4 (se = 2.9) following clodronate and was +24.6 (se = 14.9) following placebo (p = 0.03). urinary calcium, ohp and serum ictp levels increased in group c and decreased in groups a and b, but only the decrease of urinary calcium levels of group b was significant (p = 0.003). there was significantly less increase in bone pain (p=0.046) and deterioration of performance status (p=0.027) in the pamidronate group than in the placebo group. marked improvement in bone pain was observed in 44% of patients receiving pamidronate compared to 30% in controls (p = 0.025). bone resorption decreased significantly in patients with etidronate compared with those with placebo (p < 0.05). no difference in clinical and laboratory parameters of toxicity was evident between the placebo and cl2mdp arms of the trial. no difference was seen in the symptomatic response rate or analgesic requirement between patients treated with sodium etidronate and placebo. oral pamidronate produced either sclerosis or stabilisation of lytic metastases for at least 24 weeks in 5 of 24 and 3 of 23 patients at the 300 and 150 mg dose levels, respectively. in weeks 0-6, the daily consumption of analgesics was reduced in 3 patients in the 45-mg arm, in 4 patients in the 60-mg arm, and in 7 patients in the 90-mg arm. the proportion of patients who had any skeletal events was significantly lower in the pamidronate group (24 percent) than in the placebo group (41 percent, p < 0.001), and the reduction was evident in both stratum 1 (p = 0.04) and stratum 2 (p = 0.004). however, in patients treated with pamidronate there were fewer episodes of severe pain (p=0.02) and a decreased reduction of body height of 1.5 cm (p= 0.02). bone-derived isoenzyme alkaline phosphatase values increased in all groups, with a significant difference between baseline and final values in the 1,600-mg and 3,200-mg groups (p < .01 and p = .03, respectively). although the repeated measures analysis showed a significant height loss, there was no difference between treatment arms (p = .98). as regards mean worst pain a substantial numerical fall was registered for the treatment group, 21 mm, but the improvement was not significant compared to that of the placebo group. no significant differences were seen in median survival or survival rates between the groups. patients in the 90-mg group had more pronounced bone remineralization as measured by total-body bone mineral density. analgesic use increased with disease progression to a similar extent in both groups (59% increased use in the clodronate group v 64% of placebo group; difference not significant). the skeletal morbidity rate was significantly reduced at 12, 18, and 24 cycles in patients treated with 90 mg of pamidronate (p = .028, .023, and .008, respectively). resorption markers did not decrease after placebo, but ntx and crosslaps both decreased by 70% after pamidronate (p = 0.001). the event-free period (efp), radiologic course of disease, and survival did not improve. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> affected patients three hundred seventy-two women with breast

however, this was not statistically significant. in the subjects with amputations, the amputated limb had a weaker propulsion and the nonamputated limb had a stronger propulsion than controls. the flex-foot resulted in significantly different gait kinematics at the "ankle" compared to the other four feet, however, this foot did not produce an increased velocity nor an improved energy cost. the main differences in the range of motion of the joints were in the frontal plane: the eversion-inversion movement of the ankle and the adduction-abduction movement of the hip. compared with the c-walk and sach, the flex-foot showed no significant differences in energy expenditure and gait efficiency, but significantly lower percentage of age-predicted maximum heart rate and rpe values. a covariance analysis (anova) of these variables was made, which showed that the factors influencing tt amputee gait were, in order of importance, cadence and leg studied (sound or prosthetic), inter-individual variability and, finally, the prosthetic mechanism used. overall, the traumatic amputees had a similar oxygen consumption per meter traveled compared to the dysvascular amputees; however, the rate of energy consumption was much higher in the traumatic group. stride characteristics, joint motion, and ground reaction forces were recorded simultaneously during a self-selected free walking velocity in seven subjects wearing five different prosthetic feet (sach, flex-foot, carbon copy ii, seattle, quantum). increased efficiency of pushoff in the seattle ankle/lite foot exists as evidenced by the decrease loading on the opposite limb during double support and a less shortened step length on the sound side compared to the sach foot. however, no significant differences were found for the symmetry indexes of the knee range of motion, cadence, and walking speed. compared with conventional hydraulic knee controls, the oxygen consumption of transfemoral amputees provided with an electronically controlled hydraulic knee joint is reduced. during the level treadmill test, the traumatic amputee subjects showed a decrease of energy expenditure with the new prosthetic foot, more significant at sufficient speed (4 km/h): 17.00 +/- no clear trend for preference for either type of foot was evident from the subjective survey; in general the patients showed a preference for the foot that they were accustomed to. the following statistically significant differences (improvements) between the re-flex vsp versus the ff and the sach foot were found. significant differences were found in energy consumption between the traumatic and vascular groups, and significant changes in walking under different speeds and different inclines. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> adults with unilateral below-knee amputations individuals with a unilateral trans-tibial amputation seventeen male subjects with below-knee amputation (nine traumatic and seven dysvascular five physically active men with unilateral transtibial amputations served as subjects (aged 31.6 below-knee amputees wearing three different prosthetic feet subjects on a walkway at a self-selected velocity;

moreover, the antibiotic use control was operationally successful, most house-staff and attending physicians, not only antibiotic evaluating team, have accepted the program in a very positive way. icf can be used safely to curb irrational overuse of vancomycin and teicoplanin in a hospital with high methicillin resistant s. aureus infection rates. term and preterm infants who were <72 hours of age and had clinical signs or obstetric risk factors suggesting neonatal bacterial infection but stable enough to wait for results of diagnostic tests were enrolled into the study. in this study, practice changes focused towards specific icus were associated with decreases in icu vancomycin use and vre prevalence. real-time pcr increased the diagnostic yield from 23 cases (21% of patients) to 47 cases (43% of patients), compared with conventional diagnostic tests. the relative risk for colonisation with strains resistant to the empirical therapy per 1000 patient days at risk was 18 times higher for the amoxicillin-cefotaxime regimen compared with the penicillin-tobramycin regimen (95% ci 5.6-58.0). more patients in group 2 received appropriate exclusively iv therapy (65% vs. 96%, p < 0.01). the intervention increased the use of guideline-recommended antimicrobial therapy from 78.1 to 83.4% (p = 0.003). postintervention, treatment with pa and oa according to the guidelines was not significantly different between the two groups of randomized snfs. procalcitonin guidance reduced total antibiotic exposure (relative risk, 0.52; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.55; p < 0.001), antibiotic prescriptions on admission (85 vs. 99%; p < 0.001), and antibiotic treatment duration (median, 5 vs. 12 d; p < 0.001) compared with patients treated according to guidelines. the costs of these 3 restricted drugs increased very sharply (69%) in 1996 when there was loss of endorsement and capacity to perform auditing and feed back by infectious disease specialists. in the fourth phase, the analysis of bacterial resistance profile indicated a reduction of nosocomial infections due to multiresistant bacteria from 18 cases in 1995 to 2 cases per year until 1999. the prevalence of mrsa and crp remained stable, while that of epesb fell significantly (p<0.001). we conclude that a structured antibiotic order form, coupled with graphic and educational interventions can improve antibiotic use in a university hospital. the proportion of gentamicin-resistant strains such as e. cloacae or staphylococci decreased and there was no increase in aminoglycoside-resistant strains, except in escherichia coli, in which resistance to amikacin rose from 0 to 3%. uncertainty about the cost effectiveness of such interventions is likely to be resolved only by a well-designed, cluster randomised trial. a 2-year general hospital/drug utilization health record screen found no drug substitution effect, nor any change in postoperative infection rate or death among metronidazole recipients. for groups a, b, and c, the proportions of days on which adequate treatment was received were 66.3%, 92.1%, and 91.2% (p<.001); the mean numbers of defined daily doses of appropriate antibiotic therapy were 16.4, 22.2, and 20.7 (p=.003); the mean durations of hospital stay were 19.8, 23.6, and 24.1 days (p=.761); and the mortality rates during the late period were 12.9%, 15.6%, and 11% (p=.670), respectively. at the end of the intervention, the rate of mrsa isolation was significantly lower at caen hospital than at the control hospitals (353 [32.3%] of 1093 s. aureus isolates were mrsa, compared with 2495 hospital formulary restriction of clindamycin is an effective way to decrease the number of infections due to c. difficile. improved response rates were seen in the experimental (60%; 42/68) compared with the control group (48%; 36/68). ceftazidime restriction resulted in a small but nonsignificant decrease in the proportion of ceftazidime-resistant organisms acquired late (beyond 72 hrs) in the patients' icu course (56.5% vs. 45.9%). the rate of mrsa infection was positively correlated with levofloxacin use (p=.01) and azithromycin use (p=.08), whereas it was negatively correlated with summer season (p=.05). the decrease in the vre infection rate corresponded with a significant increase in the use of piperacillin/tazobactam and a reduction in third-generation and total cephalosporin use. however, vre prevalence increased steadily from 17.4% to 29.6% during the 10-year period (p<.001). statistically significant improvements in process measures were demonstrated in the intervention hospitals, including performance of a sputum (p<.01) and blood (p<.001) cultures, antibiotic administration within 4 hours of hospital admission (p<.001), and administration of the first dose of antibiotic in the emergency department (p<.001). for the rapid groups, the turnaround time was significantly shorter for oral reporting of final susceptibility results in all three study periods and for reporting on paper in the third study period. thirty-day mortality was 13.4% (1,037 of 7,719) among admitted patients and 6.3% (1,801 of 28,661) overall. the rate of appropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was higher in intervention versus control wards [73% versus 64%, odds ratio (or): 1.48, 95% confidence interval (ci): 0.95-2.29, intention to treat, adjusted for location and clustering]. lasting improvements in clinical practices may be brought about by means that are noncoercive, inexpensive and well-accepted by medical staff. there was a trend for improved clinical outcomes in patients who received cefotaxime within hospital guidelines (or = 1.73; p = .31). rates of ventouse delivery increased significantly in intervention units but not in control units; there was no difference between the two types of units in uptake of other practices. these improvements were associated with increases in overall and timely administration of prophylaxis (p<.001) in both hospitals by time series analysis, with adjustment for volume and case mix. this computer-assisted system of antimicrobial monitoring was used effectively to assess both individual patient therapy and overall antimicrobial use in a teaching hospital. this combination of clinical and administrative strategies reduced expenditures for antimicrobial agents by more than $700,000 over two years without the use of clinical specialists or any apparent sacrifice in the quality of patient care. however, there was an increase in the number of patients with cultures positive for cefotaxime-resistant acinetobacter species (from 2.4 +/- the results suggest that a short questionnaire, easily adaptable to automatization, has the potential to foster reassessment of antibiotic therapy. ad did not lead to statistically significant additional changes in already high levels +12.5% (95% ci:-3%; 28%) of compliance. the incidence of nosocomial infection and mortality also were similar across teams. the duration of antibiotic treatment for vap was statistically shorter among patients in the discontinuation group compared to patients in the conventional antibiotic management group (6.0 +/- per patient antibiotic charges were nearly $400 less in the intervention group vs controls (p = .05). average length of stay decreased from 8.6 days in 1992 to 7.6 days in 1993, with a charge reduction of $1830 per patient. the program resulted in a reduction in the antimicrobial portion of the total pharmacy drug budget from 41.6% to 28.2%. in the years since, the incidence has remained at this low level, and the antibiotic costs have decreased to a level lower than before intervention. no intervention benefit was observed for any secondary outcome. in the overnight test group, these values were 19.6 and 25.9 h, respectively (p < 0.0005). in the procalcitonin group, the adjusted relative risk of antibiotic exposure was 0.49 (95% ci 0.44-0.55; p<0.0001) compared with the standard group. an outbreak of c. difficile infection in the elderly care unit at gloucestershire royal nhs trust continued despite increased ward cleaning and strict implementation of infection control measures. annualized savings was $74,371, with 40% of the recommendations resulting in an improved antimicrobial therapy. intraoperative redosing was significantly more frequent in the reminder group (93 of 137; 68%) than in the control group (55 of 136; 40%) (adjusted odds ratio, 3.31; 95% confidence interval, 1.97 to 5.56; p < .0001). vre infections decreased from 0.29/100 patients discharged prior to initiating the program to 0.13/100 patients discharged after the second intervention (p = 0.01). for 13 months, the monthly incidence of c. difficile infection averaged more than five times that for the previous 21 months. length of stay, intensive care unit transfers, readmission rates, and in-hospital death rates were similar in both groups (p> or =.10 for all). immediately after implementation of the form, nonrecommended dosing schedules dropped to under 6% of patient-days for all three antibiotics. clinical pharmacists were effective in reducing the use of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and ticarcillin in situations where cefazolin or carbenicillin could be substituted. the majority of prescribers (87.2%) who responded to the questionnaire (56.5% response rate) felt that the 1989 policy made a positive contribution to antibiotic usage in the hospital. only 39% of ward 2 patients underwent minimal fever diagnostic tests compared to 82% in ward 1 (p < 0.001). median length of stay after randomization for control and intervention groups was 9.0 days and 5.7 days, respectively (3.3-day difference, p=0.0001). use of vancomycin decreased after a pharmacy-enforced restriction program was implemented. microbiological results were available within an average of 8.8 h by the direct method versus an average of 48 h by the routine method. all of the restrictions resulted in a decrease in the number of dosage units dispensed; however, the required countersignature by the chief of staff and deletion from the formulary were the most effective in restricting drug use. there was an 80% decrease in the use of cloxacillin, a 74% decrease of aminoglycosides and a 59% decrease of cephalosporins. glycopeptide usage was not reduced during the period of the study. over a period of 54 months, both gentamicin and tobramycin resistance decreased significantly when amikacin was used (p less than 0.001), then increased with reintroduction of gentamicin (p less than 0.05), and decreased significantly with reintroduction of amikacin (p less than 0.001). mortality and length of icu stay did not differ despite a shorter duration (p = 0.0001) and lower cost (p = 0.003) of antimicrobial therapy in the experimental as compared with the standard therapy arm. the alert antibiotic monitoring intervention was associated with significant decreases in total use and cost in the 2 years after the programme was implemented. the readmission rate was also lower. a web-based intervention was deployed as part of an existing order entry system at a university hospital on 5 february 2002. concomitantly, there was a significant (p = .002) decrease in nosocomial infections caused by c. difficile and a significant (p = .02) decrease in nosocomial infections caused by resistant enterobacteriaceae. the proportion of antibiotic courses that were assessed as satisfactory in terms of duration increased significantly after the first campaign in the hospitals where the intervention was mounted. there were no significant changes in the number of courses of therapy or cost for the unrestricted antimicrobials. patients had medical complications during the index hospitalization (p = 0.04), with no differences in other medical outcomes, including mortality, rehospitalization, and return to usual activities, between treatment arms. reduction in ceftazidime use and barrier precautions markedly reduced the incidence of colonization and infection. an example is given in the estimation of the cost savings attributable to an improved antibiotic prescribing policy at the royal liverpool hospital. antimicrobial use decreased from 121 to 79 ddd (defined daily doses)/100 procedures and costs reduced by 25% per procedure. use of selected systemic antimicrobial agents at boston city hospital (bch) has been monitored by requiring that choice of those agents be justified to a member of the infectious diseases unit before the agent is dispensed for use in a patient. the intervention significantly reduced mean antibiotic costs per patient ($19.82 vs $35.84, p = 0.03), but related labor costs exceeded this benefit. compared with the control group, intervention physicians wrote 32 percent fewer orders (11.3 versus 16.7 orders per physician; p = 0.04) and had 28 percent fewer patients for whom they either initiated or renewed an order for vancomycin (7.4 versus 10.3 orders per physician; p = 0.02). concordance with national antibiotic guidelines rose from 25% of courses pre-intervention to 51% within 5 months post-intervention (p < 0.002). in the months following the formulary restrictions, no significant detrimental changes occurred in hospital length of stay or mortality. the predicted use of ceftriaxone exceeded by 65% an estimate based on prior use of cefotaxime. when therapeutic interchange was employed, the percentage of orders for extended intervals rose to an average of 97% over a 32-week postimplementation period. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> nursing home residents admitted with pneumonia hospitalized patients who developed diarrhea

operations were completed successfully and there were no intraoperative or postoperative complications except for subcutaneous emphysema in one patient (case 4). the incidence of ponv was much higher, 72% (p = 0.0000), in the morphine group, where 56% of the children also had severe vomiting. worst pain observed in the recovery room was lower in the diclofenac group both at rest and during swallowing. voltarol appears to be the better pre-emptive analgesic for dental extractions under general anaesthesia when compared with paracetamol and no analgesia. overall, cheops scores were low for both groups at all times and did not differ between the groups at any time. this is the first case report on colon perforation occurring in an adolescent (16-year-old girl) after short-term diclofenac intake. vt and total plasma clearance were higher than in adults but the elimination half-life was similar. there were no significant differences in incidence of airway irritation or emergence delirium between the two agents. there were no significant differences between the two drugs in respect of time to awaken from anaesthesia or incidence of postoperative vomiting. caudal bupivacaine provided more pain-free patients at first but later the incidence of pain was similar in the two treatment groups. children who received the rectal diclofenac-paracetamol combination experienced a lower pain scale and a decreased need for morphine compared with children receiving each drug alone. the subpubic penile block provided significantly better analgesia than the subcutaneous ring block of the penis. the duration of anaesthesia was longer in the diclofenac group (9.6 min, sd 3.5) compared with control (7.2 min, sd 2.6) and nalbuphine (6.9 min, sd 3.0) groups respectively (p < 0.05). there were no significant differences in sedation score or frequency of use of postoperative analgesics at any time of assessment among the three inhalation anesthetics. significantly more mpca was demanded (t = 2.02, p < 0.02) and morphine received (t = 2.02, p < 0.005) by adults than children following appendicectomy. there was no difference between the groups except in the recovery area when group 3 cried more and had a higher pain score than group 2. pain scores in the tenoxicam without fentanyl group were significantly higher in recovery (p < 0.05) than the diclofenac group without fentanyl and both fentanyl groups. the use of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, diclofenac, for postoperative analgesia is well established for many types of surgery. aseptic tissue necrosis occurred around the injection site. the total incidence of nausea/vomiting was 28% and fentanyl caused nausea and vomiting in a significantly higher proportion of cases. group 1 comprised 63 patients and group 2 included 26 patients with identical diseases (inguinal hernias, varicocele, phimosis). no other differences were found between the ketamine and diazepam/diclofenac groups before and after premedication until induction of anaesthesia. these children with sdb scored significantly higher on cbcl than did normative groups, but no connection was observed between cbcl rating and experience of pain. clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 caused a lower incidence and frequency of vomiting than did placebo and diazepam (incidence and frequency: 11% and 1.37% and 3, and 34% and 2 in clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1, placebo, and diazepam, respectively; p < 0.05 for clonidine 4 micrograms.kg-1 vs placebo and diazepam). the ketamine group showed significantly lower pain scores both at rest and on swallowing, with less total paracetamol consumption (p < 0.05) during the 24 h after surgery. an increased rate of postoperative nausea and vomiting (45% vs. 15%, p < 0.05) was the only adverse effect observed. there were no obvious differences between the groups in intra-operative bleeding (as estimated by the surgeon), or in measured blood loss. the median pain scores (2 at 15 min and 1 at 30 min postoperatively) were the same in both groups. ketamine (median 2) or bupivacaine (median 2.5) groups (p<0.05). kartagener's syndrome (kgs) is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the clinical triad of bronchiectasis, sinusitis and dextrocardia (situs inversus). the authors noticed a marked increase in the incidence of reactionary post-operative haemorrhage after tonsillectomy during the course of 1992. more children required rescue analgesia after codeine at both 2 (p<0.05) and 4 h after administration (p<0.01). the rectum is a suitable route for administration of diclofenac in children 2-8 year of age and was associated with a higher relative bioavailabilty than enteric-coated tablets and an earlier maximum concentration (50 vs. 108 min). we find the analgesic efficacy of diclofenac suppository combined with local anesthetic infiltration at port sites comparable to caudal block. pain scores in the diclofenac group were only significantly lower at 12 h on day 1-3 compared to pain scores in the acetaminophen group (p<0.05). the pain recordings showed significantly less pain for the tt children from the second hour postoperatively onward, and the tt children were pain free and in school 3 days earlier than the te group. laparotomy demonstrated ischaemia and ulceration in the caecum, and histology revealed full thickness mucosal ulceration with a prominent vasculitic process. the incidence of postoperative vomiting was lower in the fentanyl group (p < 0.03) in the first 4 h, but similar by 24 h. children who received morphine at any time in the first 24 h had more median (range) episodes of vomiting [2 (0-7)] than children receiving fentanyl only [l (0-3); p < 0.03]. caudal analgesia abolished the stress-induced increase in plasma beta-endorphin level which was found in the children given diclofenac and in those who served as controls. subjects in group l required significantly more doses of postoperative analgesia than those in group c (p < 0.05). on re-auditing two years later, in a group of 100 children, post-operative pain was significantly improved. there were no statistically significant differences in age, weight, type of operation or induction of anaesthesia, 4-h sedation and pain scores and further analgesic requirements. preemptive diclofenac given rectally reduced pain intensity and morphine requirements of children anaesthetized with remifentanil for tonsillectomy. in common with the experience of others, it is possible to perform tonsillectomies safely on a same-day basis. the time to first solid intake was significantly earlier in the diclofenac sodium group (p < 0.0001). there were no significant differences between the treatment groups in operating theatre blood loss, the frequency of bleeding on the ward, or the need for operative haemostasis. children given a caudal block alone were more likely to need analgesia in the first 24 h postoperatively. a comparative analysis of the efficiency of postoperative analgesia by the discussed drugs showed that diclofenac possesses a sufficient analgetic activity and is free of any side-effects inherent in narcotic analgetics. in children 1-3 yr, sevoflurane provided more rapid early recovery but not discharge after anaesthesia of <30-min duration. the only difference related to the analgesic method was shorter duration of post-operative leucocytosis and lower phytohaemagglutinin (pha)-induced lymphocyte proliferative responses in peripheral blood in the opioid group than in the nsaid or epidural groups. after cessation of the opioid infusion, the sedation scores and the heart rates were always higher in the remifentanil group compared with the fentanyl group. an earlier awakening was observed in group 1, which we attributed to a more valuable antinociceptive protection and to lower doses of ketamine (group 1--3.2 mg/kg; group 2--4.3 mg/kg). in the remaining 20 hours, the longest analgesia duration was seen in group s, which did not differ from groups f and m, but was significantly longer than for groups b and d. rectal diclofenac has not promoted effective pain relief. there was no statistical significant difference in any of these parameters between the two groups. no significant differences in postoperative pain were found between the groups at any time. esr, plasma urea and creatinine concentrations were increased in all, plasma proteins and igg levels in the majority of patients. analgesia, as assessed by movement pain scoring, was significantly improved by the addition of diclofenac despite lower morphine consumption. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 150 children aged 1-7 years after paediatric tonsillectomy

operative blood loss was not increased, nor was there an increased incidence of wound complications as compared to the placebo group. a deep-vein thrombosis developed in ten patients (19 per cent) in the control group and in only one patient (2 per cent) in the group that was treated with compression. this showed that the 0-hypothesis could not be rejected, and that consequently no difference in the frequency of deep-vein thrombosis was detected. distal and proximal thrombosis occurred in 18.3% of patients in group a and in 10.4% in group b. no major hemorrhagic complication was observed, except for two hematomas in each group. sequential treatment was not shown to be better or worse than treatment with enoxaparin, but the trends favoured sequential treatment rather than drug treatment alone. low-dose heparin reduced the overall frequency of venous thrombosis and its extent as judged by the frequency of bilaterally abnormal scans, but this reduction did not achieve statistical significance. dhe does not seem to reduce the incidence of d.v.t. any further in this group of patients. there were no differences in bleeding or other complications in the two groups. postoperative haemorrhagic complications were seen in 6.1% in the group of standard-heparin and in 8% in the group of low-molecular-heparin. nineteen (59.4 per cent) of thirty-two placebo-treated arthroplasty patients showed evidence of a thromboembolic event in contrast with eight (22.9 per cent) of thirty-five heparin-treated patients (p less than 0.003). the a-v impulse system appears to be a safe and effective method of reducing the incidence of proximal deep-vein thrombosis, and of postoperative swelling. there was no difference in the wound hematoma or infection rate. significant improvement in protection against postoperative deep vein thrombosis, assessed by venography, was observed in the adjusted group undergoing hip replacement (p = 0.013) and overall in both groups (p = 0.017) compared with a conventional fixed dose subcutaneous regimen (calcium heparin 5000 units, 8-hourly). a and b proved to be equally safe but failed to provide any protection against deep-vein thrombosis, although b showed a tendency to reduce the incidence. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 103 elderly patients with a fracture of the neck of the femur deep vein thrombosis in hip surgery 130 patients endured the trial and the results were registered on a sequential diagram patients undergoing post-traumatic hip surgery 82 patients in whom hip fracture surgery elderly patients with hip fractures sixty-seven hip-arthroplasty and 197 patients were randomised 304 orthopaedic trauma patients with hip and pelvic fractures patients with hip fracture (77) and patients undergoing elective hip arthroplasty (213 patients with proximal femur fractures hip fracture proximal femoral fractures post-operative venous thromboembolism after hip fractures 116 women and 34 men with a mean age of 73 years (38 to 92 hip fracture surgery patients with a fractured neck of the femur two hundred and thirteen patients surgically treated for fractures of the hip one hundred and ninety-three patients total hip arthroplasty and surgical repair of hip fractures elderly patients with a fracture of the neck of the femur patients with proximal femoral fractures 150 patients with proximal femoral fractures thromboembolism after elective and post-traumatic hip surgery one hundred and sixty-one patients were analyzed patients undergoing hip fracture surgery after hip surgery patients with fractures of the proximal end of the femur elderly surgically treated patients 82 patients treated by hemiarthroplasty for subcapital fracture of the femoral neck deep-vein thrombosis after hip fractures forty-nine patients 90 patients admitted because of hip fracture fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were analyzed for development of pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis: 46 patients were included in the low molecular weight heparin (lmwh) group, and 44 in the conventional heparin group patients with hip fracture after hemiarthroplasty for hip fracture patients with transcervical and intertrochanteric femoral fractures 100 patients undergoing surgery for hip replacement or fractured neck of femur 33 patients have been treated with 210 patients undergoing nailing of a fractured neck of the femur seventy-eight patients of average age 78 years suffering from an unilateral non-pathological hip fracture underwent orthopaedic trauma patients hip fractures two hundred and thirty-eight patients with femoral neck fractures patients with hip fractures fifty-two hip-fracture patients one hundred and ten female patients, over the age of 60, with intertrochanteric or transcervical fractures elderly chinese patients 50 patients with a fractured neck of the femur hip-fracture patients patients undergoing operations on the hip for either replacement or fracture <INPUT_END>

<punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> the intervention reduced the mean charge for a prescription by 6.7% (p less than 0.025), but with a long latent period and minimal impact on resident knowledge of drug charges. with the exception of mds qi 27 (little or no activity), no significant differences in resident assessment measures were detected between the groups of facilities. statistically significant and sustained decreases in wa-mrsa rates were identified in all three arms (p<0.001; p=0.015; p<0.001). practices participating in the intervention showed increases in the percentage of records containing at least one periodontal diagnostic notation, and those practices employing hygienists showed an increase in the percentage of records with at least one preventive notation and one treatment item.(abstract truncated at 250 words) the proportion of patients at intervention hospitals who said that their surgeon did not discuss options decreased significantly (p < 0.001) from 33% to 17%, but a similar decrease was observed among control hospitals. we studied two methods to reduce the ordering of laboratory and radiologic tests by medical residents in their first postgraduate year. however, the between group difference in the adjusted combined assessment score, whilst non-significant at 6 months (early: 2.48 (se 0.43) vs. delayed 2.26 (se 0.33) during phase 2, 6 months later, the physicians in all three groups were exposed to 4 months of concurrent reminders. the intervention had a statistically significant impact on prescribing of lipid lowering drugs [odds ratio 1.59; 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.00 to 2.53] and acetylsalicylic acid (odds ratio 2.54; 95% ci 1.21 to 5.31). public release of hospital-specific quality indicators did not significantly improve composite process-of-care indicators for ami or chf. the interaction of the 2 interventions was significant (p=0.03); the largest impact was observed with the combination of physician and patient intervention (9.7 +/- at 3-month follow-up, statistically significant differences were evident in the following outcome measures: accurate classification of benzodiazepine users (z = 2.8540, p < 0.05); accurate classification of non-benzodiazepine users (z = 2.7339, p < 0.05); accurate classification of hazardous or harmful alcohol drinkers (z = 2.3079, p < 0.02); blood pressure screening (z = 3.4136, p < 0.001); and cholesterol screening (z = 6.6313, p < 0.001). at posttest, these proportions were 3.7% and 66.7%, respectively (p < .001). however, intensification increased more in the feedback alone and feedback plus reminders groups than for reminders alone and control groups (p<.001). there was no evidence, however, that feedback caused hospitals to change their practices in regard to cesarean sections. g1 and g2 subgroup with internal qi improved significantly in all criteria, and in g1 average treatment cost decreased by 60% (p < 0.01). a moderately intensive outreach intervention to increase rates of breast cancer screening through the development of office systems was modestly successful in increasing indicators of office systems and in documenting mention of mammography, but had little impact on actual performance of breast cancer screening. the intervention did not increase thrombolysis in the elderly (from 0.73 at baseline), but nearly two thirds of eligible nonrecipients were older than 85 years, had severe comorbidities, or presented after at least 6 hours. seminars and feedback were no more effective in modifying practice than guidelines alone, which was thus the most cost-effective option. for all 3 clinical topics, the decrease in mean total number of tests ordered by physicians in the intervention arm was far more substantial (on average 51 fewer tests per physician per half-year) than the decrease in mean number of tests ordered by physicians in the feedback arm (p = .005). the numbers of untreated and uncontrolled patients in each group reduced (control = 32.3%; audit = 38.3%; risk = 32.6%). over a 2-year period, overall glycemic control improved in the intervention site but did not change in other primary care sites (final a1c 7.5 vs. 8.2%, p < 0.001). results indicated that the outreach program significantly improved many patient care processes (lab work, nursing, dietary management, ventilator management, ventilator weaning). the weighted t-test for a and f versus no a and f (p=0.62) and cal versus no cal (p=0.76) were not statistically significant. prescribing feedback significantly reduced overall and second-line antibiotic prescribing, but academic detailing was not significantly more effective than postal bulletin in changing antibiotic prescribing practice. the intervention group of doctors showed improved performance in providing clinical information on pathology requests and in adequate surgical excision of skin lesions. overall attitudes of dutch and norwegian doctors also improved significantly (effect sizes 1.06 and 0.87, respectively), as did both knowledge (effect size 1.06) and attitudes (effect size 1.49) concerning exacerbation treatment in slovakia. audit and feedback together with seminars and practice guidelines reduced inappropriate prescriptions by 43% (p < 0.001). intervention practices implemented more of the processes than control practices overall (p = .003), for adults (p = .05), and for children (p = .04). information-giving and communication skills improved significantly in subjects receiving training and feedback on their performance, with the greatest improvements occurring before feedback was given. significant reductions in total charges (9.8%), total tests (15.1%), sma-12s (20.6%), sma-6s (12.5%), and cbcs (18.5%) were observed in the intervention group, as compared with the control group. nevertheless, the last investigation shows a significant (p < 0.05) difference between the two groups in favour of the experimental group: 12 process indicators versus one for catheter management protocol and seven versus one for protocol on pressure lesions. interventions had no effect on ldl cholesterol values (p = 0.64), which improved in all groups over time. compared to physician-feedback alone, a dual intervention combining a patient letter with physician feedback produced modest improvements in glycemic, lipid and blood pressure control individually, but substantial improvement in a combined measure of these three outcomes together. the intervention resulted in statistically significant improvement for two of the seven outcome measures: foot examination (odds ratio 1.68; 95% confidence interval 1.19-2.39) and eye examination (1.52; 1.07-2.16). the percentage of children who were up to date for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis and haemophilus influenzae type b; polio; and measles-mumps-rubella immunization in the study's bonus group improved by 25.3 percentage points (p < .01). postintervention immunization levels were 71.4% (95% confidence limits [cls]: 63.2%, 78.7%) for patients from the intervention group and 68.5% (95% cls: 60.8%, 75.4%) for patients from the control group. the interventions significantly improved the quality of management of oral anticoagulation by belgian gps, mainly as a result of an education and support programme. the proportion of requests that were non-rational decreased more in the intervention than in the control groups (p = 0.009). there was a 3% increase in statin prescribing in cvd patients at 6 months post-intervention for both randomized groups, but there was no statistical difference between the groups (beta = 0.004; 95% ci = -0.01 to 0.02). when we controlled for diagnosis, the manual plus feedback group had the most profound decrease (42%) in laboratory use, followed by the manual group. secular trends were significant with improvement in both experimental and control hospitals for acute (odds ratio = 2.7, p = 0.007) and in-hospital (odds ratio = 1.5, p < 0.0001) care but not discharge care. there was no significant difference over the study period in either combination prescribing of benzodiazepines or in prescriptions for long-term benzodiazepine therapy. repeated measures anova demonstrated a significant increase in all three study groups throughout the time in total compliance scores (from 56%-73%), as well as scores for immunizations (from 62%-79%) and other preventive care (from 54%-71%). for process of care measures, decreases were seen in all groups, with no significant differences in change scores. practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine. as a result of quality assurance intervention, quality of performance was significantly improved in two of the tasks (p less than 0.0001, with 6.7, and 9.8 percentage points improvement), and marginally improved in one task (p = 0.06, 5.7 percentage points improvement). the increase in generic prescribing by physicians in the experimental group was significantly greater than for control physicians (p = 0.01). the addition of feedback had no impact on gp prescribing patterns. mean percent change in performance between intervention and control physicians for cbc monitoring was 16% versus 10%; for creatinine monitoring, 0% versus 17%; and use of cytoprotective agents, -3% versus -1%. the increase was greater in practices receiving feedback plus reminders for only two of the five criteria "told about dependency" increasing from 52 (11.1%) to 118 (25.8%) in the feedback only group, and from 27 (10.5%) to 184 (43.0%) in the feedback plus reminders group; odds ratio (or) 1.46 (95% confidence interval (95% ci) for all patients the length of follow up was significantly longer in test practices (test 199 days, control 167), and a smaller percentage dropped out of active treatment in test practices (test 37.5%, control 42.1%). implementation of an education and feedback-supported acute low back pain care guideline for primary care clinicians was associated with an increase in guideline-consistent behavior. there was a general decline in the prescription rate recordings, but there were no significant differences between the intervention groups and the control group. printed educational materials alone may be as effective as audit and feedback and educational outreach in improving nurses' performance and outcomes of care for people with ui. most of the inappropriateness occurred in the ordering of microbiology (50%) and special blood chemistry (40%). no statistically significant difference was observed in the frequency of consultations involving aids prevention between the intervention group (1.2% of consultations) and the control group (1.4%). had higher adherence to guideline recommendations for hemoglobin a1c testing (61.5% vs 48.1%, p = .01) and ldl testing (75.8% vs 64.1%, p = .02). practices that received either or both the enhanced feedback and the reminder messages were significantly less likely than the control group to request the targeted tests in total (enhanced feedback odds ratio 0.87, 95% ci 0.81-0.94; reminder messages 0.89, 0.83-0.93). this revealed a significant rebound in overall cost by the feedback group for both carotid endarterectomies and lumbar surgery. the tools and data-generating capabilities designed and constructed in stage i of the project were integral components of all subsequent stages of the program. however, testing rates increased significantly among women making preventive care visits (or, pap test visit = 1.23, 95% ci, 1.01-1.51, p = 0.04; or, physical exam visit = 1.22, 95% ci 1.06-1.42, p = 0.009, intervention vs. control clinics). the intervention, which is simple and could easily be applied in other settings, produced improvements significant at the p = .001 level. the fractional prescribing rates for proton-pump inhibitors decreased from 61.0% to 52.6% in the intervention arm and increased from 68.1% to 76.0% in the control arm (not significant due to low power). no intervention benefit was observed for any secondary outcome. setting up a register and recall system improved patient assessment at 18 months' follow up but was not consistently better than audit alone in improving treatment or risk factor levels. both interventions tended to have more impact at lower-volume cabg sites (for interaction: p =.04 for beta-blockade; p =.02 for ima grafting). hii quality managers perceived the chf project as significantly more successful compared with lii quality managers (63% versus 13%, p < .01). small reductions in inappropriate transfusions were found at the second audit, but the change was significant only for the hospitals receiving the letter-only intervention. at baseline, there was no significant difference between the patients with respect to osteoporosis medication use (intervention 32% versus control 34%) or bone densitometry use (intervention 9% versus control 5%). the visits by non-physician observers resulted in a higher score on extent of use of records and on assessment on outcome and year report. in addition, adjusted mortality was similar in both groups, as were length of in-hospital stay, physician visits after discharge, waiting times for invasive cardiac procedures, and readmissions for cardiac complications. a higher case-mix index and presence of a clinic champion were associated with higher rates of referral to a state-level quitline. among 45 physicians completing all modules (343 patients), intervention physicians had numerically but not significantly higher rates of bmd testing (26% vs 16%, p =.04; rate difference, 10%; 95% ci, 1%-20%) and bisphosphonate prescribing (24% vs 17%, p =.09; rate difference, 7%; 95% ci, -1% to 16%) or met a combined end point of bmd testing or osteoporosis medication prescribing (54% vs 44%, p =.07; rate difference, 10%; 95% ci, -1% to 21%) compared with control physicians. after 24 months the trial of labor and vaginal birth rates in the audit and feedback group were no different from those in the control group, but rates were 46% and 85% higher, respectively, among physicians educated by an opinion leader. the groups did not differ in the change in proportion of patients who received a properly timed antimicrobial prophylaxis dose (-3.8 percentage points [95% ci, -13.9 to 6.2 percentage points]) after adjustment for region, hospital size, and surgery type. patients in intervention practices had greater improvements than those in control practices for diagnoses of hypertension (improvement difference, 15.7 percentage points [95% ci, 5.2 to 26.3 percentage points]) and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (improvement difference, 8.0 percentage points [ci, 0.0 to 16.0 percentage points]). medication appropriateness improved in the combined intervention group but not in the single intervention group. compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. professional standards review organization claims data were used in defining, planning, implementing and evaluating an approach to an ambulatory medical care problem utilizing educational intervention. we tested the efficacy of an educational program conducted by professional standards review organizations in reducing the inappropriate use of x-ray pelvimetry. from 1993 to 1995, screening rates doubled overall (from 24% to 50%), with no significant differences between intervention and control group sites. the intensive intervention had greater improvement in the increased proportions of patients dialyzed with prescribed blood flow (p = 0.02) and documented review of prescription (p = 0.01). physicians in arm a had a significant reduction in mean total number of inappropriate tests ordered for problems allocated to arm a, whereas the reduction in inappropriate test ordered physicians in arm b for problems allocated to arm b was not statistically significant. we undertook a study to assess the impact of comparative feedback vs general reminders on practice-based referrals to a tobacco cessation quit line and estimated costs for projected quit responses. compliance increases were greatest for physicians who were older, nonwhite, with a second speciality, in solo practice, not members of the ama, not residency trained, and not board certified. a simple program of confidential feedback and educational materials blunted cost increases, increased the use of first-line antibiotics and was highly acceptable to ontario primary care physicians. there were no differences in performance scores between residents receiving report cards and those who had not in immunizations, counseling, total preventive health, diabetes, hypertension, and total disease management. the aggregated mean scores for all diseases, and for malaria and diarrhoea, improved significantly. the proportion of patients who received influenza vaccine improved from 40% to 58% in the experimental group (p<.001) vs from 40% to 46% in the comparison group (p =.02). prescriber feedback and management guidelines were shown to influence antibiotic prescribing for urti and choice of antibiotic for tonsillitis/streptococcal pharyngitis. concordance between groups did not differ significantly. the mean proportions of acceptable treatments of urinary tract infection before intervention in the urinary tract infection group and asthma (control) group were 12% for both groups which increased by 13% in the urinary tract infection group relative to the control group. both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated no effect of the intervention in increasing the proportion of patients who received reperfusion, aspirin, beta-blockers, or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. this increase was seen in all study groups: control hospitals, 40% to 51% (p < .001); cme hospitals, 21% to 49% (p < .0001); and cme+qa hospitals, 27% to 55% (p < .0001). physician interventions that included practice-level feedback about monitoring of glycemic control successfully led to improved care of diabetic medicare beneficiaries. preference in the group receiving both module and portrait increased by +0.115 immunization rates in the two intervention groups were 30% higher than in the control group; the control group immunized 50% (2,405/4,772) of its target population, while the poster and poster/postcard groups immunized 66% (1,420/2,149) and 67% (2,427/3,604), respectively. physicians who received the feedback letters did not differ from those in the control group in terms of their proportion of prescriptions compliant with the criteria, either before the feedback or after it (p > 0.05). none of the two types of feedback on prescribing of asthma drugs had a statistically significant impact on gps' prescribing patterns. physicians randomized to telephone follow-up showed significantly higher rates of practice specific ppv coverage in 2000 than those receiving the routine mailing only, and 27% vs. 17% (p = 0.01) of high volume physicians and 34% vs. 22% (p = .052) of african american serving physicians achieved at least a 5% increase in their cumulative ppv claims coverage. tailored feedback to the physician with directed educational materials did not seem to improve most aspects of documentation and knowledge of child sexual abuse, although notable improvement was seen during the time period studied. during both a baseline and subsequent intervention period, interns documented significantly more cholesterol management for inpatients with coronary artery disease (cad) than without cad. overall compliance with the preventive care protocols was low: 10-15% in physicians receiving neither feedback nor reminders, increasing to 15-30% in those receiving reminders. patient satisfaction scores improved significantly in the comprehensive intervention group (by 0.06 points on a 1 to 5 scale, p = 0.02) but not in the education only group (by 0.02 points, p = 0.42); however, the improvement was not significantly greater in the comprehensive intervention group (p = 0.20). multilevel regression analysis showed that, after correction for baseline scores, patients' evaluations of continuity and medical care were less positive after the intervention in the intervention group (4.60 v 4.77, p < 0.05 and 4.68 v 4.71, p < 0.05, respectively). no significant differences were observed between the study groups on any measures. however, a significantly larger decrease in the percentage of smears lacking endocervical cells was found in the groups receiving monthly overviews of their results with peer comparison, when compared with the groups not receiving this type of feedback (odds ratio 0.75). results; there were no changes in the numbers of tests per thousand requested in either of the study groups for any of the tests. multifaceted interventions involving audit and feedback combined with either academic detailing or seminars appear more effective in changing prescribing practices of antibiotics than audit and feedback alone. in practices receiving the guidelines there was a 20% reduction in requests for spinal examinations compared with control practices (p < 0.05). prescribing in the patient education group and the patient education and feedback group increased at a significantly lower rate than in the control group. prescribing rates in the intervention and control groups for the five main drug groups, total prescribing and potential substitute prescribing and ordering before and after the interventions. there was no difference in prescribing change based on type of intervention (education versus feedback). group 1 stabilized at approximately 80% while group 2 continued to improve from 76.6% to 84.0% (p less than 0.001). delivery of individual emergency plans increased (p = 0.008), and unscheduled emergency visits decreased (p = 0.064). passive receipt of results improved ordering of vaccination from 40% to 59% and ordering of mammography from 8% to 16%. there were no consistent differences between the interventions in stimulating improvements in performance as indicated by adherence to the recommendations for asthma or angina. centralized mailings of guideline summaries, performance feedback reports, and chart reminders had no observable impact on quality of care in this setting. there were no significant differences between the intervention and control groups in meeting patient preferences, metabolic status, and complication rates. yet 59% of all quality managers perceived the amvt project as being successful to very successful, and more efi quality managers perceived success than did wfi managers (71% versus 40%). performance of the procedure necessary to diagnose hypercholesterolaemia even deteriorated. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> twenty-nine

the nasogastric and orogastric groups were similar in age, case distribution, surgery length, and blood loss. the incidence of vomiting and nasogastric tube insertion (21.5%) was higher in patients in group i than in those in group ii. there were no significant differences between the two groups concerning the presence of postoperative fever, nausea, vomiting, anastomotic leaks, or pulmonary or wound complications. the length of hospital stay was similar in both groups and three patients in each group required a nasogastric tube or reinsertion of one. early oral feeding in patients in arm a was associated with a significantly faster resolution of postoperative ileus (p < .01), with a more rapid return to a regular diet (p < .01), with an earlier first passage of stool (p < .01), and with a shorter postoperative stay (p < .05) than patients in arm b. rates of nausea and vomiting were similar in both arms. there were no significant differences in the presence of atelectasis, postoperative fever, wound infections and anastomotic leaks between the two groups. injury severity score, morbidity, and lab values were not significantly different. this study does not support a significant effect of early removal of ngts on nausea and vomiting in patients undergoing open repair of the infrarenal aorta. postoperative fever was noted in 23 patients (58%) in group 1 and 14 (38%) in group 2 (p = 0.13); atelectasis was diagnosed in 38 per cent of patients in group 1 and 14 per cent in group 2 (p = 0.03). patients who were not intubated mobilised more quickly, and spent less time in hospital. however, no significant differences were found between the two groups with respect to duration and severity of postoperative paralysis, as measured by occurrence and duration of nausea and vomiting, postoperative peroral fluid intake and time for defecation. there was no statistically significant difference in the incidence of mortality, complications (including vomiting) or time to return of intestinal motility between the two groups. nasogastric tubes reduced the incidence of vomiting from 28 in the no-tube group to 10 in the tube group (p less than 0.05), but most had only one or two episodes. postoperative abdominal distention was more common in patients without nasogastric tubes, whereas pulmonary complications were more common in patients with nasogastric tubes. the postoperative complications such as anastomotic leakage (1.24% vs 2.58%), acute dilation of stomach (1.86% vs 0.06%) and wound complications (2.48% vs 1.94%) were similar in the groups, but fever (3.73% vs 9.68%, p<0.05), pulmonary infection (0.62% vs 4.52%, p<0.05) and pharyngolaryngitis (3.11% vs 23.23%, p<0.001) were much more in the control group than in the experimental group. the incidence of anastomosis leak was significantly higher in the ng-tube group (6 vs. 0; p=0.016). no difference in length of the first passage of gas by anus and defecation after operation was found between two groups. there were no significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of postoperative complications. no significant differences were found between the two groups in the duration of hospitalization, time to begin peroral fluid intake, occurrence of hiccups, vomiting, nausea, parotiditis, nasal septum necrosis, anastomotic leak and wound dehiscence. duration of postoperative perfusion (p = 0.02) and length of hospital stay (p = 0.03) were also significantly longer in the tube group. pneumonia (13.0 versus 5.0 per cent; p = 0.047) and atelectasis (81 versus 67 per cent; p = 0.043) were significantly more common in the ngt group. the rates of anastomotic leak were similar in both groups (6.9% and 5.8% for the njt group and no-njt group, respectively; p = .71), as were the rates of major postoperative complications (25.9% and 21.5%, respectively; p = .42) and overall postoperative mortality (0.9% and 0.8%, respectively; p = .50). no statistical difference was recorded concerning the occurrence of postoperative nausea, vomiting, abdominal distension, complications and day of clinical release. no significant difference could be seen in the tubed or no-tube group. developed incisional hernias compared with 15 (6.6 percent) of 229 patients who were not decompressed (p = 0.085). the incidence of nasogastric tube insertion in the tubeless group was similar to the incidence of nasogastric tube reinsertion in the intubated group (p=0.747). the return of bowel function, return to a regular diet, and postoperative length of hospital stay were similar in both groups. there were no significant differences in nasopharyngeal or gastric bleeding, inability to cough effectively, respiratory infections, wound disruptions, reoperation, and wound infection rates (5%) between the two groups. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 110 gynecologic oncology patients undergoing extensive intra-abdominal surgery 177 patients qualified for the

influenced, with rigor, tremor and also walking disturbances responding better than bradykinesia of the hands. adverse events were no different than those of patients taking placebo. there was a mean reduction in daily "off" time of 2.1 hours in the ropinirole 24-hour group and 0.3 hours with placebo. there were no significant differences between treatments for any of the pdq-39 subscores, the sf-36 variables or the eq-5d utility score. in this group of patients, adl scores improved in the entacapone group (p < 0.01 v placebo), and there was also a 40 mg reduction in levodopa requirement (p < 0.01 v placebo). at 6 months, patients randomized to pergolide had a statistically significant improvement in total parkinson's score, scores of activities of daily living, motor function, number of "off" hours, hoehn and yahr stage, and numerous parameters of parkinsonian function including bradykinesia, rigidity, gait, and dexterity. differences between the treatment groups became significant at a daily dose of 0.75 mg of pramipexole dihydrochloride. ld + ent treatment was associated with a lower retirement rate (2 [17%] of 12 vs. 6 [50%] of 12; p = 0.12), lower absenteeism rate (21.5 vs. 43.5 days; p < 0.0001), improved self-perception of disability progression over 2 years (change score 1.0 vs. 4.5; p < 0.0001), and lower scores for both motor fluctuations and dyskinesia assessments compared to ld monotherapy. both rasagiline and entacapone reduced mean daily off-time (-1.18 h rasagiline and -1.2 h entacapone vs placebo -0.4 h; p=0.0001, p<0.0001, respectively) and increased daily on-time without troublesome dyskinesia (0.85 h vs placebo 0.03 h; p=0.0005 for both). long-term entacapone treatment effectively prolonged the beneficial response to levodopa in parkinsonian patients with the wearing-off phenomenon. compared with placebo, patients treated with 1.0 mg/d rasagiline had 0.94 hour less off time per day, and patients treated with 0.5 mg/d rasagiline had 0.49 hour less off time per day. the updrs part iii showed improvements of 34% for pramipexole (p = 0.0006) and 23.8% for bromocriptine (p = 0.01) versus 5.7% for placebo. gait analysis disclosed a significant improvement by levodopa/benserazide in walking speed, stride length and the range of motion of hip, knee and ankle joints. the trial demonstrates that with deprenyl the levodopa dosage can be reduced considerably without prejudicing the therapeutic outcome. entacapone is effective at increasing the duration of response to levodopa and at relieving parkinsonism in patients experiencing motor fluctuations and was well tolerated during the 24 weeks of treatment. pramipexole was also superior to placebo as measured by improvement in the modified hoehn and yahr scale and a reduction in the number of "off" hours for patients on concomitant levodopa therapy. in terms of change in absolute off time, rotigotine was non-inferior to pramipexole. adverse events occurred in 79 patients (69.9%) in placebo, 82 (72.6%) in 100 mg, and 98 (86.0%) in 200 mg. no apparent differences were detected in the occurrence of drug-related adverse events between the zydis selegiline group and placebo-treated groups. the addition of bromocryptine in high doses (average daily dose 71 mg) induced a significant improvement in the total score of the webster and the nuds scales. in the total population, the updrs activities of daily living and motor scores were significantly improved (p < 0.05) by entacapone vs placebo. the mean daily l-dopa dose was reduced significantly with ropinirole treatment (242 mg versus 51 mg; p < 0.001) as was the percent awake time spent "off" (11.7% versus 5.1%; p = 0.039). no irreversible side effects were noted. this resulted in a significant decrease in the amount of levodopa side-effects while maintaining or improving the original parkinsonian clinical stage. investigators' global measures of disease severity indicated that significantly more tolcapone-treated patients had reduced wearing off and symptom severity (p<.001 vs placebo). following incremental dose titration, patients in the cabergoline group had a significant reduction in hours "off" per day from 5.0 (sd 2.1) to 3.0 (sd 2.5), but there was no change in this measure in the placebo group [4.0 (2.2) and 3.3 (2.3) respectively]. with 200 mg tolcapone tid, unified parkinson's disease rating scale motor and total scores were significantly reduced, and quality of life (sickness impact profile) scores were significantly improved. ropinirole significantly reduced the duration of off periods as assessed by self-scoring diary cards. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients with fluctuating parkinson disease forty-six patients with parkinson's disease

combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (p=0.02 by the log-rank test; hazard ratio for death, 0.70; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.95), with five-year kaplan-meier estimates of overall survival of 53 percent and 40 percent, respectively. there was no difference in toxicity between the two treatments with regard to leukopenia, thrombopenia, vomiting and nephrotoxicity. no difference could be detected in the survival of patients who received simultaneous versus sequential chemotherapy. for c-hart, maximum acute reactions of mucositis, moist desquamation, and erythema were lower than with hart, whereas no differences in late reactions and overall rates of secondary neoplasms were observed. it also offered higher progression-free survival (46% v 25% at 5 years; p =.0068), higher locoregional progression-free survival (lrpfs) (50% v 36% at 5 years; p =.041), and higher distant metastasis-free survival (dmfs) (86% v 57% at 5 years; p =.0013). patients from both groups with a complete response had a significantly longer survival time than those with a partial response (p less than 0.001). tumour regression after chemotherapy either complete (cr) or partial (pr greater than 50%) was observed in 48% in the fm group and 41% in the poc group, and lymph-node regression (cr + pr) was respectively 15% and 23%. there was no significant difference in the overall survival rate, due to the radical neck dissections of recidive metastases. no significant difference in survival existed between the two groups. on the other hand, crp-rt gives a significantly higher incidence of stomatitis (p=0.0067) and a marginally worse thrombocytopenia (p=0.09). the occurrence of local toxic effects (i.e., mucositis and epidermatitis) was significantly greater in the rt-blm group (rt-blm, 72%, vs. rt, 21%). there was no significant difference in the response rates at the end of treatment but disease free survival at three years was better in the ct/rt group (63.3% vs 20%). for inoperable patients, the combined treatment was significantly associated with an increase in complete remission rate (group a, 44%) as compared with radiotherapy alone (group b, 30%) (p = .037). the difference in complete response rate between both treatment groups (24% in group a and 63% in group b) was statistically significant (p = 0.015). at 24 months, the proportion of patients without relapse was 42% for arm c vs. 23% for arm a and 20% for arm b. patients in arm a less frequently developed g3+ acute mucositis than their counterparts in arm b or c (14.7% vs. 40.3% vs. 44%). no survival improvement was observed. the overall 3-year primary locoregional tumour control, disease-specific and overall survival rates were 19, 36 and 30%, respectively. however, toxicity was more common in patients treated with the two modalities of combined treatment and there were no differences in overall survival rates (p = 0.706). five-year overall survival, specific disease-free survival, and locoregional control rates were 22% and 16% (log-rank p =.05), 27% and 15% (p =.01), and 48% and 25% (p =.002), in arm b and arm a, respectively. there was better locoregional control in the tpf group than in the pf group (p=0.04), but the incidence of distant metastases in the two groups did not differ significantly (p=0.14). the percentages were higher after radical surgery alone for locoregional recurrence (31% and 15.6%) and for death (28% and 18.6%). no significant difference in overall survival was found. mucositis and vomiting predominated in the cddp-fu arm (p = .03, p < .001, respectively). iv patients were significantly more fatigued (p <.006). overall survival was significantly better (p = 0.03) in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group than in the control group, with a median survival of 5.1 years versus 3.3 years in the no chemotherapy group. locoregional control and distant disease-free survival were significantly improved with cisplatin (log-rank test, p = .039 and .011, respectively). median progression-free survival and overall survival were, respectively, 19.7 and 33.3 months (arm a) and 30.4 and 39.6 months (arm b). the corresponding recurrence-free rates and five-year survival rates were 71.8% and 17%, and 65.5 and 23.5% respectively. a sequential analysis was used, and blm demonstrated a significantly greater local efficacy after the 32nd matched pair was assessed. there were no significant differences in failure-free survival, time to locoregional failure, or quality of life as measured by functional assessment of cancer therapy-head and neck. estimated 2-year disease-free and overall survival rates were 38.2% and 57.4% for arm 1, 48.6% and 69.4% for arm 2, and 51.3% and 66.6% for arm 3. in our experience the radio-chemotherapy combination, according to the described schedules, failed to improve both local control and overall survival; the comparison with the control group does not suggest that induction or intercalated chemotherapy can increase long-term survival even if initial complete and partial response rates are high. mucosal tolerance was significantly worse in treatment arm b (p less than 0.00004). after surgery 62% of the patients randomized to chemotherapy-radiotherapy and 60% of the patients in the standard treatment group were clinically tumor free. the median survival was 16.5 months in the combined-therapy group and 11.7 months in the radiotherapy group (p less than 0.05); the 3-year survival was 41 percent and 23 percent, respectively. concurrent non-platinum chemoradiotherapy reduces recurrences, new tumours, and deaths in patients who have not undergone previous surgery, even 10 years after starting treatment. two-phase' treatment was applied to cancer of the tongue (table 3) and to cancer of the paranasal sinuses (table 4). although there has not been any significant benefit in overall survival, the primary control rate is higher in patients who received methotrexate in addition to radiotherapy. the rates of distant metastasis were 10% for chemotherapy group and 32% for control group (p=0.06). the relapse-free survival rate was higher in the combined-treatment group (61 percent vs. 41 percent, p=0.08). disease-free survival at 4 years was 38% on the rt arm compared to 46% on the ct/rt arm (p = n.s.). rates of residual and recurrent disease, as well as distant metastases, were similar for the two groups. the addition of tpz increased hematologic toxicity but did not improve outcomes in patients with resectable, stage iv hnscc using the protocol administered this small randomized study. actuarial 3-year locoregional control rates were 32% in the alt group and 27% in the pa-rt group. enteral nutrition through gastrostomy tube was more frequent in arm b before treatment and at 6 months (p < 0.01). occurrence of a second carcinoma was 3 times as frequent in the irradiation group (9 patients) as in the chemotherapy group (3 patients). the overall median survival duration was 33 months for i-fu and 25 months for placebo (p = .08). at a median follow-up of 84 months, no significant differences have emerged in overall survival, 15 vs 37 months, or time to progression, 8.5 vs 14.5 months, for groups 1 and 2, respectively. analysis of preliminary results has shown that: 1) early and late side effects are similar in both groups; 2) after completion of treatment, the percentage of patients in complete remission was 71% (20/28) in the experimental group and 43% (12/28) in the control group; this difference was statistically significant among non responders to induction chemotherapy (1/15 versus 13/20, p = 0.001), but non significant among responders (11/13 versus 7/8) and 3) there were no differences between both randomized groups in term of 3-year overall survival and of 3-year loco-regional control. the 3, 5 and 10-year local-regional recurrence-free survival rates in stage iv disease were statistically better in arm ii (21.5%, 15.9% and 15.9%) than in arm patients in groups ii and iii had significantly higher overall response rates then those in group i (p = 0.011 and p = 0.0025, respectively) with no difference between groups ii and iii (p = 0.60). the response rate for the 12 rt & ct patients was four complete remissions (cr) and four partial remissions (pr); the 11 rt patients had one cr and three pr. among responders, the survival was found highly correlated with a good initial general status (p less than 0.01), and with the highest total doses of cisplatin (p less than 0.02).(abstract truncated at 250 words) treatment with tpf resulted in a reduction in the risk of death of 27% (p=0.02), with a median overall survival of 18.8 months, as compared with 14.5 months in the pf group. the incidence of moderate to severe mucositis was significantly higher on arm a than arm b (p = 0.02). no statistically significant differences in the 5-yr progression-free survival, in the median time to loco-regional and distant progression and in the 5-yr overall survival were observed. this final analysis demonstrates no benefit in survival using preoperative chemotherapy for advanced stage, resectable head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. there was no significant difference between the sites of recurrence at death or last follow-up (p = .38). the rates of complete tumor resorption were: group a--27.3%, group b--19.2% and group c--16.7%. the incidence of distant metastasis was significantly reduced (p less than 0.03) with chemotherapy. disease-free survival was significantly longer in the combined-therapy group than in the radiotherapy group (hazard ratio for disease or death, 0.78; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.61 to 0.99; p=0.04), but overall survival was not (hazard ratio for death, 0.84; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.65 to 1.09; p=0.19). we could not demonstrate a benefit with the addition of carboplatin to postoperative radiotherapy, possibly because of insufficient sample size. no significant differences were demonstrated in local disease control or actuarial survival rates at three and five years. at 4 years, overall survival rates were 56 and 46%; disease-free survival rates were 33 and 30% in the ct+lrt and the lrt groups, respectively. however, bleomycin had no significant effect on the 3-and 5-year survival rates, and it did not significantly reduce the incidence of local recurrences. there was a significantly better 1-year slc after rct (58%) compared with rt (44%, p = 0.05). after a follow-up of 12-96 months overall survival was 58% in arm a and 45% in arm b (n.s.). hyperthermia did not confer any benefit. this analysis at 12 months showed a disease free survival of 71% in the test arm vs. 45% in the control arm, which is statistically highly significant (p less than 0.01). with a median follow-up of 41 months, the 3-year projected overall survival for patients enrolled in arm a is 23%, compared with 37% for arm b (p =.014) and 27% for arm c (p = not significant). acute mucositis grade 3 or 4 was more frequent in arm b (38%) than in arm a (16%) (p < .001). three-year locoregional failure-free rates were 84% in the tpz/cis arm (95% ci, 71% to 92%) and 66% in the chemoboost arm (95% ci, 51% to 79%; p = .069). loco-regional tumour control was 31% after cf, 32% after v-chart and 48% after v-chart+mmc, respectively (p<0.05). there was superior disease-free survival for patients with n1 disease on the maintenance arm (70%) compared with the standard arm (42%) (p = .024). acute morbidity and deaths during intervention were higher in the study group (p = 0.007). after adjustment for these factors, the chemotherapy did not seem to improve the effectiveness of the local treatment in terms of loco-regional control and survival. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> advanced-stage oropharynx carcinoma advanced cancer of the head and neck three hundred patients were analyzed: 79 had tumors

the aminophylline group included a greater percentage of patients who did not abate their scores, and they stayed in the hospital for more days than those in the other groups. there was no significant difference between the groups in terms of severity score, number of nebulisations required in the nebulised groups and the outcome as measured by the length of hospitalisation. we did not find any significant difference in the rate of improvement and the final score (p = 0.49) in the four groups. the change in oxygen saturation of recipients of both agents was significantly better than that of recipients of salbutamol alone or ipratropium bromide alone. clinical scores and oxygen saturation levels improved more rapidly in the bronchodilator groups than in the placebo group up to 24 h, but these drugs did not have a sufficient effect to change the natural course of the disease. group differences were not statistically significant in any of the secondary outcomes. in a double blind randomised trial, we found no evidence that nebulised ipratropium bromide was of clinical benefit in acute bronchiolitis. nebulized albuterol significantly improved the clinical score and reduced the respiratory rate of those with recurrent wheezing relative to those in the randomized groups. the fall in sao2 with salbutamol was seen whether infants received it as the first or second nebulisation. the outcome of patients at 120 min was found significantly better than the baseline values (p < 0.05). the heart rate rose slightly more in the albuterol group (increases 7.76 from baseline) versus the placebo group (decreases 6.79). there were no statistically significant differences in any outcomes among the four treatments, except for oral albuterol, which produced an increase in heart rate (15 beats per minute, p = .005). oxygen saturation decreased in group i without reaching statistical significance. there were no significant changes in vptef/ve and tptef/te after albuterol or saline treatment. after two treatments, there was a significant improvement in the wheeze scores (p less than 0.05) and total scores (p less than 0.05) of the albuterol group compared with the placebo group. nebulized terbutaline therapy does not appear effective in treating moderately ill infants with the first acute bronchiolitis. the median (95% confidence interval) time to resolution of illness (days) was similar: albuterol, 9.0 (8-13); placebo, 8.0 (7-9); p =.3) oral salbutamol is not superior to placebo in reducing the duration of symptoms in mild cases of acute bronchiolitis in children. children who received saline solution as initial therapy had no significant differences from baseline in any of the assessment measures. average daily improvements, as reflected by changes in the clinical score and length of hospital stay, was essentially the same for infants treated with placebo, salbutamol alone, and dexamethasone alone. there was no difference between the groups in oxygen saturation (p = 0.74); patients treated with salbutamol had a small increase in heart rate after two treatments (159 +/- similar statistically significant bronchodilation occurred after all three bronchodilators as indicated by a decrease in peak inspiratory pressure and respiratory system resistance, but these changes were small and probably clinically insignificant. racemic epinephrine and albuterol at equivalent doses had no effect on the need for hospitalization or supplemental oxygen in bronchiolitis in the outpatient setting compared to nebulized saline placebo, though this study may have missed less dramatic clinical effects due to small sample size. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> infants with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis on mechanical ventilation sixty-nine infants with moderate-severe bronchiolitis hospitalized at their first episode of wheezing or crepitations in the chest mildly affected ambulatory infants with acute bronchiolitis infants younger and those older than 6 months of age children's hospital of tunis from december 2004 to april 2006 infants with first-time wheezing infants less than 12-months-old bronchiolitis in egypt young children with acute bronchiolitis young children infants with mild-to-moderate acute viral bronchiolitis twenty-two patients with respiratory syncytial virus bronchiolitis and in respiratory failure were enrolled n = 20 140 infants (of 310 approached) with a clinical diagnosis of acute bronchiolitis with respiratory rate <or= 70 breath/min, heart rate <or= 200 beats/min, hemoglobin oxygen saturation (spo2 infants hospitalized for acute viral bronchiolitis patients aged 12 months or younger (n = 37) benefited from metaproterenol treatment (improvement in respiratory rate and rdi) but not to the same degree as children aged 24 months or older (n = 23 eighty-eight infants (median age 5.5 months) being treated for their first episode of wheezing tertiary pediatric intensive care unit in a university affiliated hospital in the northeastern united states bronchiolitis in infancy mildly affected infants with acute bronchiolitis twenty infants younger than 1 year of age (mean age, 5.8 hospitalized infants with bronchiolitis infants with recurrent wheezing wheezing infants infants with bronchiolitis in egypt fifty-one (42%) had respiratory syncytial virus (rsv) isolated from their nasopharyngeal aspirates a total of 149 infants were randomized;

patients not eligible for radical prostatectomy chose orchidectomy less frequently and favoured nonsurgical endocrine treatment than in the treatment protocol arm. unadjusted mean knowledge scores were significantly higher in the computer group than the counselor group (p =.048), but they were equivalent when adjusted for demographic differences (p = 0.34). in the long term, with respect to well-being, patients in the sdmi group had less intrusive thoughts (p =.05) and better general health (p =.01) and tended to be less depressed (p =.07). decision aids are an effective decision-support strategy for women considering genetic testing for breast/ovarian cancer risk, and are most effective before the patient has made a decision, which is generally at the point of having blood drawn. sixty newly diagnosed men were randomly assigned to receive either a self-efficacy information intervention that consisted of a written information package with discussion, a list of questions they could ask their physician, and an audiotape of the medical consultation (n = 30), or a written information package alone (n = 30). the intervention had no effect on uptake rates of treatment options, length of consultation with the surgeon, time point of treatment decision making, perceived involvement in decision making, neither decision related nor general patient satisfaction. the total decisional conflict score was significantly lower in the decision aid group 3 weeks postrandomization compared with the usual care group (11.6 vs. 20.4; p = 0.0007). a decision aid for individuals considering genetic testing for hnpcc is an effective intervention to reduce uncertainty and assist individuals to make an informed choice regarding genetic testing for hnpcc after genetic counseling. the percentage of preference matches did not differ between groups (ig 49%, cg 51%, p = 0.71). video/leaflet patients had lower decisional conflict than corresponding controls (30.3 versus 36.8, adjusted 95% ci = -7.4 to -0.6, p = 0.021), greater knowledge (75% versus 65%, adjusted 95% ci = 6% to 13%, p < 0.001) and no evidence of increased state anxiety (35.7 versus 36.1, adjusted 95% ci = -3.9 to 1.7, p = 0.46). the computerized da improved realistic expectations by 52.7% over baseline versus 27.6% with the audio-booklet (p=0.015). the illustrated pamphlet decision-aid was effective in improving knowledge of prostate cancer screening tests: 95% of the experimental group were aware of the possibility of false-negative test results compared with 85% of the comparison group (p <.01). had significantly improved knowledge (50% of items correct, 95% ci 46-53%; vs 45% correct, 95% ci 42-48%) (p = 0.048) and lower levels of decisional conflict (mean 21.6, 95% ci 20.7-22.5; vs mean 24.3, 95% ci 23.4-25.2) (p < 0.001). participants assigned to view public web sites were less likely to review information (116 participants [76.8%] reviewed) than those assigned to experimental groups (399 [86.7%] reviewed; p = .004). decisional conflict was significantly lower amongst men receiving the evidence-based booklet (p = 0.038). longitudinal analyses revealed that the da was effective among carriers who were initially undecided about how to manage their breast cancer risk. the da group rated themselves better prepared for decision making and showed significant improvements in knowledge (p = 0.001) and realistic risk perceptions (p = 0.001). men who received the brief pda had significantly higher knowledge scores (p<0.0001) and less positive attitudes (p<0.0001) regarding psa testing than men in the control group. more da recipients from all education levels were 'informed' (p = 0.02), particularly in lower education (50.0% da versus 17.8% g) and university-educated groups (79.4% da versus 32.1% g). there was no difference between groups in the measures of satisfaction or anxiety (mann-whitney u-test; p>0.05). there were no between-groups differences in participants' ratings of convenience, effort, or satisfaction following exposure to the decision aid. a decision-aid for women facing choices about birth after cesarean section is effective in improving knowledge and reducing decisional conflict. two weeks after the intervention, there was significantly less decisional conflict in the intervention group (adjusted difference = -16.6 the counseling approach, but not the educational approach, was superior to the control condition in producing significant increases in perceived limitations and risks of brca1 testing (p < .01) and decreases in perceived benefits (p < .05). the mean consultation duration was not significantly different between groups (24 minutes for intervention group versus 21 minutes for control group, p = 0.42). hysterectomy rates were lower for women in the interview group (38%) (adjusted odds ratio [or], 0.60; 95% confidence interval [ci], 0.38-0.96) than in the control group (48%) and women who received the information alone (48%) (adjusted or, 0.52; 95% ci, 0.33-0.82). compared to pamphlets, das appear to improve the agreement between women's and physicians' decisional conflict about hrt. compared with the pamphlet group, the decision-aid group had statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements in terms of realistic personal expectations of the benefits and risks, decisional conflict, and perceived acceptability of the intervention. the method of education did not affect patient involvement although patients tended to learn more about breast cancer treatment after using the multimedia program than after reading the brochure. the rate of vaginal birth was higher for women in the decision analysis group compared with the usual care group (37% v 30%, adjusted odds ratio 1.42, 0.94 to 2.14), but the rates were similar in the information programme and usual care groups. information-giving was the most frequent activity for both gps and patients, although gps did this at twice the rate compared to patients and at higher rates in consultations involving computerised decision aids. despite the low overall vaccine acceptance rate, it is concluded that individualized decision analysis can influence the clinical decisions taken by knowledgeable and interested patients. patients at the low-literacy site were more engaged with the entertainment-based aid than patients at the high-literacy site. at three months a lower proportion of women in the intervention group than in the control group were undecided about treatment (14% v 26%; -12%, -23% to -0.4%), and a higher proportion had decided against hormone replacement therapy (46% v 32%; 14%, 1% to 28%); these differences were no longer apparent by nine months. patients who received the informational intervention were significantly less interested in undergoing psa screening than controls (mean difference in interest, 0.8 on 5-point scale, p < .001). there was no difference in anxiety, knowledge, or decisional regret across the 2 groups. there was no difference between the groups in decision outcomes: 52% of patients in the control group and 49% in the experimental group completed planned screening tests (p = 1.0). there was no difference in screening interest between the control group and the two information groups (p =.8). treatment decision within 3 months was made more often in the intervention group than in the control group (96% and 89% respectively, p = 0.02). in pre-post testing, the decision aid also appeared to increase the proportion of patients with plans to intervene on their chd risk (absolute increase ranging from 21% to 47% for planned medication use and 5% to 16% for planned behavioral interventions). the developed decision aid improved patient outcomes better than a control pamphlet when implemented during genetic counseling and given to the patient to take home. both groups experienced a statistically significant reduction on the dcs (-0.55 +/- 0.59, p < 0.0001 versus -0.52 +/- there were no differences between intervention and control groups in the univariate analyses. there were no significant differences between the videotape and 'usual care' groups with respect to satisfaction with the decision making process (mean score 73 vs. 77%; p = 0.37), satisfaction with the decision made (mean score 73 vs. 78%; p = 0.28), physical functioning (38 vs. 38%; p = 0.76), mental health functioning (49 vs. 49%; p = 0.94), or in referral for coronary revascularization (or 0.60; 95% ci 0.22-1.65; p = 0.33). compared with the pamphlet, patients whose clinicians delivered the decision aid during the office visit showed significant improvements in knowledge (difference of 1.6 of 9 questions, ci 0.3, 2.8) and nonsignificant trends toward finding the decision aid more acceptable (odds ratio 3.1, ci 0.9, 11.2) and having less decisional conflict (difference of 7 of 100 points, ci -4, 18) than when a researcher delivered the decision aid just before the office visit. at 2-week follow-up, subjects undergoing videotape intervention showed a 78% improvement in the number of knowledge questions answered correctly (p = .001), and knowledge increased about mortality due to early-stage prostate cancer, psa screening performance, treatment-related complications, and disadvantages of screening. an innovative decision aid effectively involved patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in decisions about their medications but did not improve adherence or hba(1c) levels. reported use of the video was higher for patients who had greater than a high school education (or 1.73), were married (or 2.20), and reported no prior abnormal prostate cancer screening test results (or 3.39). women who received the da (the intervention group) were better informed than the control group (mean increase in knowledge score out of 10, 2.62 for the intervention group vs 0.68 for the control group; p < .001), and a significantly greater percentage made an informed choice (73.5% vs 48.8%; p < .001). the beneficial effect of the decision aid did not persist (p = 0.44 for differences between study arms after 12 months). the overall surgery rate was 22% lower in the videodisk group (26% versus 33%, p = 0.08). colorectal web is more effective than a standard colorectal cancer web site at prompting previously unscreened individuals to choose a preferred colorectal cancer screening test and to be screened for colorectal cancer. in addition, the videotape was more effective than vis alone in increasing short-term knowledge, regardless of practice type, race/ethnicity, or educational level. these data indicate that preliminary print education can be used to educate low-risk individuals about brca1/brca2 genetic testing. fecal occult blood testing or flexible sigmoidoscopy was ordered for 47.2% of intervention participants and 26.4% of controls (difference, 20.8 percentage points [95% ci, 8.6 to 32.9 percentage points]). women in the decision-aided group had higher knowledge and lower risk-perception scores about both methods, more positive attitudes about the medical method, lower decisional conflict, more stable evaluations of the decision information over time and higher perceived usefulness of information ratings. women assigned to the interactive prenatal testing decision tool had higher knowledge scores (79.5% compared with 64.9%, p<.001), were more likely to correctly estimate their risk of procedure-related miscarriage (64.9% compared with 48.1%, p=.002) and carrying a down syndrome-affected fetus (63.5% compared with 15.1%, p<.001), were more satisfied with the intervention (p<.001), and had less decision uncertainty (p<.001) than controls after viewing the intervention. mean state anxiety scores were reduced by counseling but were within normal ranges for both groups at baseline and after either intervention, regardless of risk status. informed decision-making was higher, perceived risk more realistic and decisional conflict over time lower in the decision analysis group. motives for treatment did not differ significantly between the video image and standard cp groups. congruence between personal values and decisions about hrt increased significantly more in the experimental group (p < or = .003). there was no significant difference in satisfaction with decision-making process scores between the ihd sdp and usual practice groups. those in the group intervention showed a significantly greater increase in knowledge than those in the individual counseling intervention. no differences were found between the groups for anxiety, general health status, prostatic symptoms, utility, or costs (excluding costs associated with the video disc equipment). patients exposed to a decision aid answered a greater percentage of knowledge questions correctly (54% control vs 69% web site, p <.001, and vs 69% brochure, p <.001) and were less likely to be screened (94% control vs 86% web site, p = .06, and vs 85% brochure, p = .04). this form of educational material is successful in increasing knowledge about risk management options and in reducing decisional conflict in the shorter term. patients who used the decision board were more likely to choose bct (94% vs 76%, p =.03). decisional self-efficacy, preparedness to participate in decision-making, and arthritis self-efficacy were greater in participants randomized to the intervention arm compared to those receiving the information pamphlet ( the use of imda did not affect the women's overall uptake rate of the prenatal screening test for down syndrome. results show that the educational intervention reduced intention to obtain genetic testing among women at average risk and increased intention among high-risk women at 6 months. knowledge, decisional conflict, satisfaction with health care provider, and self-efficacy improved following intervention and were maintained for 12 months for all groups. ei group men had a screening frequency two times greater than that of si group men, but the difference was not statistically significant: 8% vs. 4 % (or = 1.94) fo rcomplete screening, and 19% vs. 10% (or = 2.08) for complete or partial screening. a tailored prenatal testing decision aid plays an important role in improving women's knowledge of first and second trimester screening tests and assisting them to make decisions about screening and diagnostic tests that are consistent with their values. over the entire study period, satisfaction with decision making was higher for patients in the decision board arm than for patients in the control arm (p =.032). there was no difference between groups with respect to the primary outcomes of knowledge, satisfaction with decision, decisional conflict or ht use. there were no statistically significant differences between interventions in perceived clarity of values and overall congruence between values and choices. patients in the ab group were more knowledgeable and had more realistic expectations about the risk of stroke and hemorrhage (in the ab group, 53%-80% correctly estimated different risks; in the control group, 16%-28% gave correct estimates). they also tended to have a reduced mean level of anxiety and increased satisfaction with the treatment choice compared with the control group. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START>

reduce injuries related to fire, mostly because few alarms had been installed or were maintained. inspection performed four to six weeks after the office visits showed that of 55 experimental group parents without detectors prior to the program, 26 purchased and 19 installed them correctly. before the intervention the rate of burn injuries per 100,000 population was 4.2 times higher in the target area than in the rest of oklahoma city. only 65% of voucher households had functioning alarms at follow up, largely due to failure to redeem vouchers. a higher percentage of males (25.0%) than females (17.3%) reported making safety changes following the intervention. knowledge gains were demonstrable only as a result of the school program. stepwise multiple-regression analysis found that the influence of the book was limited to families with children who sustained scald burns (p < 0.05). there was a distinct difference between control and intervention homes with respect to safety knowledge and home hazards requiring minimal to moderate effort to correct. the total costs of care for injuries were significantly lower in the intervention group compared with the nonintervention group with a cost of $372 per injury prevented. parents seen by physicians in the intervention group received significantly more injury prevention counseling for 5 of the 6 safety practices, and they were significantly more satisfied with the help their physicians provided on safety topics. the educational phase of the study was completed by 129 families, 65 in the intervention group and 64 in the control group. the intervention resulted in significant improvements in safety practices for up to two years but did not reduce injuries that necessitated medical attendance. among families without a working smoke detector at baseline, the intervention was associated with an increased probability of having a working detector at follow up (relative risk (rr) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (ci) 1.3 to 8.6). no significant differences in safety practices were found between study groups. although only one couple in the experimental group did not have an operational smoke detector, enough of the couples in the control group had operational smoke detectors that results were not significant.(abstract truncated at 250 words) the intervention package was not effective in reducing the frequency of minor unintentional injuries in children at home, and larger trials are required to assess the effect on more severe injuries. after intervention, significantly more families in intervention group used fireguards (relative risk 1.89, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 2.94), smoke alarms (1.14, 1.04 to 1.25), socket covers (1.27, 1.10 to 1.48), locks on cupboards for storing cleaning materials

control group; -0.14% (p = ns) in the hrt group (p < 0.05 vs. controls); -0.18% (p = ns) in the calcium group (p < 0.05 vs. controls); and -0.06% (p = ns) in the calcitonin group (p < 0.01 vs. controls; p < 0.05 vs. calcium and hrt). patients who received combined therapy had significantly higher bmd in both the vertebrae and in the femora (p <0.05) in comparison with patients who were treated with hrt or etidronate alone after 4 years. the continuous treatment group had significantly lower final values of fibrinogen, fvii, atiii, protein s and hcii than the placebo group; the cyclic treatment reduced fibrinogen in comparison with placebo but the difference was not significant. total and ldl cholesterol levels were reduced by 14% (95% ci, 11-17%) and 19% (95% ci, 14-23%), respectively, in the hrt group vs. 3% (95% ci, 0-7%) and 5% (95% ci, 0-11%) in the diet group. factors that were independently associated with smaller increases in girths were: for waist, greater overall activity (p = 0.005) and hispanic ethnicity (p = 0.02); and for hip, work activity (p = 0.003) and greater alcohol consumption (p = 0.03). total serum cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol were reduced by approximately 5% (p less than 0.01) and 8% (p less than 0.01), respectively, after 1 year of combined oestrogen-cpa therapy in comparison with both the initial values and the placebo group but serum triglycerides and hdl-cholesterol levels were unchanged in both groups. patients who received combined therapy had significantly higher bone mineral density in both vertebrae (p < 0.05) and femora (p < 0.01), in comparison to patients who were treated with hrt, or ice, alone. the reduction in hot flushes for both active treatment groups remained significantly different from placebo throughout the 12-week trial. the therapy reduced postmenopausal bone loss significantly (p less than .001), whereas it did not have a statistically significant influence on total body fat mass or total lean body mass. the premarin-treated group had an increase in spine density and total body density (p less than 0.05), but a decrease in radial density (p less than 0.05). total serum cholesterol and ldl-cholesterol levels were reduced by approximately 15% and 20% (p less than 0.001), respectively in the hormone group but were unchanged in the placebo group. frequent fallers swayed significantly more often than the others, but there was no evidence that their muscle strength was poorer or that the group treated with hormone replacement therapy fell less frequently. the percent of body fat increased in each group from baseline measurements, with the greatest increase in the hormonal replacement group. total serum cholesterol levels were significantly reduced by 4-10% (p less than 0.05-p less than 0.001) in a dose-related way in the hormone groups. the loss of femoral neck bmd was lower in the hrt (-0.3%) and the hrt + vit d (0.9%) groups compared with the vit d (-2.4%) and the placebo groups (-3.7%). corresponding hrs (nominal 95% cis) for composite outcomes were 1.22 (1.09-1.36) for total cardiovascular disease (arterial and venous disease), 1.03 (0.90-1.17) for total cancer, 0.76 (0.69-0.85) for combined fractures, 0.98 (0.82-1.18) for total mortality, and 1.15 (1.03-1.28) for the global index. the urinary creatinine excretion rate was significantly increased (p less than 0.001) in the group receiving high-dose hormones, and the urinary creatinine/body weight ratio was significantly increased (p less than 0.05) in all treated groups as compared with the placebo-group. exercise alone was associated with significant decreases in total cholesterol (5.2%, p < .05), triglycerides (2%, p < .05), and low-density lipoprotein (ldl) cholesterol (10%, p < .01), and a significant increase in the high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol-ldl ratio (17.2%, p < .01). those women who did not receive any hormonal treatment and the postmenopausal women before hrt showed nearly identical gh- and igf the hypocholesterolemic effect was correlated to body mass index in a way that indicated the most pronounced decrease in lean women. however, there was no significant difference in changes of other lipid profiles between the two groups at 6 and 12 months (non-hrt: tc -2.7%, +0.7%, hdl +2.9%, +5.1%, ldl -5.2%, -4.1%, apo-a +0.5%, +0.9%, apo-b +3.8%,

hazard, 0.65 [95% ci, 0.48 to 0.89]; p = 0.006). daily treatment with na-ee2 was well tolerated and protected the endometrium from ee2-induced proliferation and hyperplasia. after 15 months of hormone treatment mean plasma homocysteine concentration was lowered by 12.6% compared with baseline (p < .001; analysis of variance for repeated measures). raloxifene did not significantly change high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (hdl-c), triglycerides, or plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (pai-1); whereas hrt increased hdl-c by 11% and triglycerides by 20%, and decreased pai-1 by 29% (for all, p < .001). with treatment, there were no differences in overall values for body weight and blood pressure (p > 0.4), and order of treatment had no significant influence (p > 0.3). <INPUT_END>

<punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> in the clinical study, 100% of intraoperative leaks were sealed versus 18% of control patients (p =.001). this study demonstrates clear benefit from bioglue in the treatment of alveolar air leaks through reduction of air leak duration, chest drainage time, and hospital stay. tachosil showed a trend towards reduced incidence of postoperative leakage when measured >48h or >7 days after surgery (30.7% vs 38.96% and 24% vs 32.46%, respectively). application of the sealant resulted in control of air leaks in 92% of treated patients (p < or = 0.001). statistically significant reductions were found in the experimental group in the overall incidence of aal (34% versus 68%, p = 0.001), mean duration of aal (1.1 versus 3.1 days, p = 0.005), mean time to chest tube removal (3.5 versus 5.0 days, p = 0.02), and the incidence of paal (2% versus 16%, p = 0.015). statistical analysis revealed no differences between the groups. no significant statistical difference was observed concerning the quality of aerostasis, the post-operative drainage, the persistance of residual collection or faulty reexpansion after removal of the latter, and the necessity for repeated drainage. intraoperative air leaks were sealed in 77% of the sealant group compared with 16% in the control group (p < 0.001). the reduction of intra-operative air leak intensity in the subgroup with grades 1-2 was significantly higher for the tc group (p=0.015). an additional reduction of the duration of post-operative air leakages by the treatment with fibrin glue could not be shown. in treated patients, the mean numbers of intraoperative aal after application of sls were significantly smaller than in untreated patients (38.5 ml versus 59.9 ml, p = 0.0401). there were no complications related to the use of the patches, and a significantly lower incidence of dead pleural space was observed in the es group (5% vs 40%, p = .020). postoperative hospitalisation time was shorter in the vivostat group than in the control group but the difference was not significant (0.5 days, p=0.12). we conclude that the routine use of a fixed quantity of fibrin glue is not effective in reducing the

survival galactomannan antigenemia preceded post-mortem histological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis <INPUT_END>  <punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> a close relationship was found between clinical course and the kinetics of gm indices in survivors. this pcr method is very sensitive for the diagnosis of ia but is associated with a moderate rate of false positives; the gm assay exhibited poor sensitivity but high specificity. univariate and multivariate analyses revealed no significant association between detection of gm by eia and detection of abnormal pulmonary signs by ct. the specificity was 99.6% (748 of 751 cases). requiring 2 consecutive samples with an od index > or = 0.5 resulted in the highest test accuracy, with an improved positive predictive value. for gm detection in serially sampled serum, the sensitivity was 47%, the specificity 93%, the ppv 73% and the npv 82%. fifteen of them had positive gm titers (87 samples) and 12 had positive pcrs (20 samples). after bmt, the eia and latex agglutination test were positive in 19 and 4 patients respectively of 25 patients with confirmed aspergillosis and 14 and 7 of 15 patients with probable aspergillosis. applying both cut-offs to a subgroup of 21 'possible' fungal infections further identified and upgraded six cases of ia. eleven patients (11%) having a positive result (od index >1.5 ng/ml) in two consecutive platelia aspergillus tests were considered galactomannan-positive cases. galactomannan elisa had fewer false-positive and false-negative results in pediatric patients than in adult patients. it was lower in children compared with adults (p <.0001) and in allo-hsct patients compared with non-allo-hsct adults (p =.0002). increasing the cutoff value to >or= 0.66 yielded a sensitivity of 30%, specificity of 95%, and positive and negative likelihood ratios of 5.5 and 0.74. a combination of the two tests improved the specificity (to 100%) and positive predictive value (to 100%) of each individual test without affecting the sensitivity and negative predictive values. the double sandwich elisa detecting aspergillus galactomannan (gm) was prospectively evaluated for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (ia) in 50 haematological patients at risk for ia. the gm eia is a useful diagnostic toolfor the diagnosis and monitoring of the course ofla in the presented institute. this statistical profile was better than that of other triggers, including unexplained fever, new pulmonary infiltrates, isolation of aspergillus species, and abnormalities seen on computed tomography. although the elisa test did not have any role in the anticipation of the diagnosis, it clarifies the diagnosis of ia in allo-hsct. reported sensitivity of the galactomannan enzyme immunoassay as an early diagnostic test for invasive aspergillosis (ia) has been widely variable, ranging from 29% to 100% in earlier clinical studies. positive or undetermined results were detected one to 4 months before the diagnosis of ia in eight of the 11 patients (72.7%) with proven ifi. in a receiver-operating characteristic (roc) analysis, the area under the roc curve was greatest for elisa, using two consecutive positive results (0.97; p = 0.036 for elisa versus pcr, p = 0.055 for elisa versus bdg). sensitivity of the test was 55.6%, specificity was 93.9%, the positive predictive value was 71.4%, and the negative predictive value was 88.6%. galactomannan antigenemia preceded post-mortem histological diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in two patients by 17 and 81 days, respectively. sensitivity was 69% and specificity 96% if only positive results are considered; when 'undetermined' test results were combined with positive results, sensitivity attained 100% and specificity 92% suggesting that the cutoff value for positivity can be lowered from 1.5 to 1.0. galactomannan antigenemia (index, >0.5) was detected with a sensitivity of 86%. fourteen patients showed positive results for aga (od index> antigen was detected on at least two sequential sera in 48 of 53 patients, with a sensitivity of 90.6%. sensitivity and specificity rates for the nested-pcr assay were up to 63.6% [95% confidence interval (ci): 30.8-89%) and 63.5% (95% ci: 53.4-72.7%) respectively, and 33.3% and 98.9% (95% ci: 7.5-70.1% and 94.2-99.9%) for gm respectively. in the two patients found positive with both methods, the elisa test became positive earlier than the la test or remained positive after the la test had become negative. in addition to serial screening for gm antigenemia and radiological surveillance, pcr-elisa may improve the rates of early diagnosis of ia and the management of patients with hematological malignancies. the incidence of proven ifi was 1/31 (3.2%) in the allogeneic stem cell transplant (sct) (aspergillus spp), 0/26 in the autologous sct, and 1/60 (1.6%) in the induction therapy group (c. krusei). despite enhanced sensitivity, the pcr method failed to detect nucleic acid in a probable case of invasive candida infection that was detected by elisa. case-control analysis showed that treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam was the only risk factor significantly associated with receiving false-positive test results. twelve of 16 patients with confirmed or suspected ia were elisa positive on two or more occasions, compared with 10 of 15 who were la positive. we compared an aspergillus fumigatus-specific taqman real-time pcr assay for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (ia) with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay platelia aspergillus method. aspergillus species were detected by pcr or elisa with bal fluid samples from five of seven patients who had radiological evidence of ipa. a quantifiable response to antifungal therapy in clinical samples and the rabbit model supports the development of this assay for early diagnosis and therapeutic monitoring. screening for aspergillus antigen and dna has been introduced for the early diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (ia) in adults, but data in children at risk are scarce. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients with cystic fibrosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary

and 3 maintained or worsened overall qol. enteral nutrient supplementation was shown to bring about a significant improvement in serum albumin level even in a short-term study. despite adequate statistical power, no functional measures differed except that the number of falls was lower among treated subjects vs. controls (0% vs. 21%; p = 0.05). fat free mass increased from baseline to week 8 (p<0.05) with no difference between groups a and b (p=0.97). subjects ingesting nutritional supplements between meals significantly increased their total caloric and protein intake above that of controls and did not reduce their food-derived caloric or protein intake compared to controls. at radiotherapy completion, energy intake increased in g1/g2 (p < or = .04), g1 more than g2 (p = .001), and decreased in g3 (p < .01). in the study group, oral administration of the egg albumin-based supplement significantly improved serum albumin, calorie and protein intake, and npna, and, compared to controls, this maneuver was associated with a trend to increased anthropometric parameters and improved subjective global assessment evaluation. the compliance to the prescribed diet was very high in both groups, and no carry over effect of the previous dietary intake was observed during the follow-up period. in general, nutrient intake in the experimental group remained similar to that before surgery, whereas intake in the control group decreased significantly, particularly at the one-week postoperative evaluation. the intervention was associated with greater increases in energy and protein intake in women than men (interaction p < 0.001 for both). the group-by-time interaction approached significance on the karnofsky performance status scale. the nutrition intervention group had a higher mean total energy (p=0.029) and protein intake (p<0.001) compared with the standard practice group. there was no significant change in energy intake or percent ideal body weight in either group. out-patients lost more weight than in-patients did (p < 0.05). it was concluded that preoperative supplementation to achieve weight gain before surgery is of no apparent value. serum igf-i levels increased in the i-group (p<0.001), but were unchanged in the c-group (p=0.07 between the groups). inspiratory muscle strength was also improved (intervention = +11.4 cm h2o versus control +4.8 cm h2o) although this did not quite reach statistical significance. during follow-up, patients in the experimental group were far more likely to maintain nutritional repletion or continue to improve (61%) than patients in the control group (14%). fewer patients in the treatment group (7/52) required antibiotic prescriptions compared with the control group (15/49). serum osteoprotegerin (opg) increased significantly in group 2 with a maximal increase (27%) observed at 6 ( p<0.01) and 9 months ( p<0.05). patients in the nutritional supplement group (n = 19) had a significantly greater increase in body weight (2.57 +/- the intention-to-treat analysis indicated significant improvements in lower- extremity muscle strength in both training groups compared with the nutrition group at 1st follow-up. refeeding and weight gain were associated with a significant increase in absolute lymphocyte count and with an increase in reactivity to skin test antigens after 21 days of refeeding. food supplements did not affect treatment response or complications, nor did they offer any survival advantage. although a weight gain of 7 kg (p = 0.003) was obtained the difference to the control group was statistically not significant (p = 0.08). the increase in body weight and tricipital skinfold was significant in group i. total body water and fat free-mass remained without changes. there were similar improvements in triceps skinfold thickness, dietary intake, fecal fat, and pain score during a period of 3 months in both groups. the intervention group consumed more energy (difference 194 kcal/day; p = 0.02) and protein (difference 11.8 g/day; p<0.001) than controls. age, body cell mass (bcm), muscle function, gender distribution and qol did not differ between ons patients (n=38) and dc patients (n=42) at baseline. nutritional intervention had no significant effect on lymphocyte cd4 counts, on plasma tnfr 55, tnfr 75 and ilr 2 concentrations and on quality of life. there was a numerical difference, not statistically significant (p = 0.3), indicating a shorter time of survival in patients in the gr + sc group. the results showed the benefit of dietetic treatment in experimental patients with head and neck or abdominopelvic cancer. compared with the control group, the supplement group had larger increases in fat-free mass and grip strength, although the differences did not reach statistical significance. quality of life measured by the quality-of-life index (ql-index) increased significantly in both groups, but did not differ between groups. nutritional behaviour correlated with subjective well-being, low intake with complaints of tumour treatment side effects and weight loss with malaise. individualized dietary counselling for 6 months was associated with a significant decrease in the crohn's disease activity index, an increased incidence of disease remission, a decreased need for prednisone and salazopyrin therapy, a reduction in the number of days spent in hospital, and a reduction in the amount of time lost from work due to crohn's disease, when compared with control patients who did not receive dietary counselling but who were seen regularly in follow-up under similar circumstances. one month after discharge, the control patients had a nutritional intake (3-d diet record) comparable with the intake of the general population that did not increase further. no difference was observed between the control and adjunctive groups in clinical status at the end of treatment or in long-term outcome. group a increased their energy intake from a median of 8.7 to 10.1 mj (p < 0.01 compared with the control group after intervention) and gained a mean of 2.9 kg body weight (95% ci 1.2; 4.7, p = 0.005 compared with the control group), while group b increased from 7.4 to 10.8 mj (p = 0.005) and gained 2.3 kg (1.2; 3.3, p = 0.002). nutritional interventions using dietary counselling had no impact on the percent of planned chemotherapy dose administered, the degree of toxicity experienced by patients, or the frequency of treatment delays. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> fifty-five subjects completed a

none of the 21 patients given cefamandole had infection. significant reduction in wound infection occurred in the study group compared with control subjects irrespective of the underlying pathologic lesion. in the non-perforated cases the infection rates were 3.4% in the metronidazole and 7.9% in the placebo group. postoperative wound infections were detected in 11.6% of placebo-treated patients and in 1.4% of cephaloridine-treated patients (p less than .02). there were 13 wound infections (as defined by the discharge of pus), 12 (out of 51) in the saline group and 1 (out of 49) in the metronidazole group. there was no significant difference in the incidence or severity of wound infection or post-operative intra-abdominal sepsis between the metronidazole-treated and placebo groups. the majority of wound infections were due to b. fragilis, either alone or in association with aerobic organisms, but infection due to e. coli and staphylococcus aureus also occurred. sepsis rates were found to be 27% for the untreated group, 9% for the group receiving metronidazole only, 8% for the group receiving cotrimoxazole injection only and 2.7% for the group receiving both drugs. no differences occurred in the incidence of wound infection in the two groups. there were no side-effects due to the drugs. anaerobic infection did not develop in any of the metronidazole-treated patients, but infections did develop in nine (19%) of the 46 controls. ceftizoxime decreased the infection rate compared with pla (0 vs. 8; p less than .01). the efficacy of a single 500 mg intravenous intra-operative dose of metronidazole in the prevention of postoperative wound infection, following appendicectomy for acute mural appendicitis, was studied in a prospective randomized placebo controlled trial. no toxic effects of the antibiotics were detected, no anaesthetic complication occurred, and resistant strains of bacteria normally sensitive to the antibiotics were not isolated from wounds. the study showed for each group a significant reduction of the incidence of wound infection in patients receiving prophylaxis. the 3-day tinidazole treatment, as compared with the single-dose prophylaxis, did not further improve the outcome. no significant difference was found in the incidence of complications between the treated and a control group, raising doubts as to whether this substance is of value when used intraperitoneally in peritonitis. post-appendicectomy sepsis still causes considerable morbidity and prolongs hospital stay. cefazolin significantly reduced the number of aerobic organisms isolated from wound infections, but did not significantly reduce the incidence of wound infection. the infection rate differed in both groups (antibiotic and placebo) only for perforated appendices significantly. there were 16 wound infections, 15 (out of 50) in the placebo group, 1 (out of 54) in the metronidazole group. a significant reduction in the incidence of anaerobic wound infection was observed in the treated group (p less than 0.02). the three groups of patients were similar in regard to age, sex, duration of operation and pathologic classification of the appendix. in those receiving both drugs the infection rate was 3%, a highly significant difference from that in the other three groups. wound sepsis occurred in 12.3% of metronidazole-treated patients compared with 24% in the povidone-iodine group and 23.5% in an untreated control group. blood levels of metronidazole taken at the end of operation showed a wide variation but there was no correlation with subsequent infection. the postoperative wound infection rate is insufficient to demonstrate the efficacy of metronidazole for prophylaxis in nonperforated acute appendicitis, although there appears to be a tendency of to assume its efficacy in this regard. the use of prophylactic antibiotics did not yield better results than the use of placebos. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> septic complications after emergency appendectomy for nonperforated appendicitis wound infections in appendectomy acute mural appendicitis acute nonperforated appendicitis perforated appendicitis anaerobic infections after emergency appendicectomy patients with perforated appendicitis 588 consecutive patients who were operated on on suspicion of appendicitis following appendicectomy from november 1978 to january 1980 283 patients was finally accepted into the study patients over the age of 12 undergoing emergency appendicectomy one hundred patients with uncomplicated appendicitis uncomplicated childhood appendicitis children undergoing appendicectomy 102 consecutive patients undergoing appendectomy through an incision in the right iliac fossa this study included 127 patients 102 patients with presumptive acute appendicitis 139 patients studied, 70 received 104 patients with a presumptive diagnosis of acute appendicitis against wound infection after appendicectomy uncomplicated appendicitis during childhood 544 children operated upon for uncomplicated appendicitis elderly patients emergency appendicectomy gastrointestinal surgery children with appendicitis 131 patients from 158 appendicectomies 496 patients 400 cases 223 consecutive suspected appendicitis patients two hundred and seventy-one patients were assessed patients with generalized peritonitis patients undergoing surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis 1735 patients undergoing acute nonperforative appendicitis (npa 25 of 220 patients had to be excluded appendectomy 122 patients with npa acute nonperforating appendicitis patients receiving prophylaxis patients who cannot take oral drugs 400 cases of uncomplicated appendicitis operated upon by three senior surgeons appendicectomy uncomplicated appendicitis in children seventy-two patients, 47 men and 25 women, with a mean age of 27.5 years (range 15 to 60 years), underwent appendectomy and were studied one hundred patients undergoing appendicectomy through a right iliac fossa incision patients undergoing appendicectomy 82 patients showed a wound infection rate of 4.8%;

p=.024). thirteen (29%) of the patients treated with ceftazidime failed to respond clinically to treatment, versus four (9%) of the patients treated with ceftazidime/tobramycin (p = 0.046). cefoperazone plus amikacin resulted in an 88% overall response rate and cured 14 of 15 patients with bacteremia. the occurrence of further infections assessed in patients for whom the allocated regimen was not modified did not differ between the two groups (12% in both groups). the overall cure rate for the ceftazidime group was 71% and for the gentamicin plus cefotaxime 47%. control of infection was achieved in 72% of patients treated with latamoxef and 55% treated with cephradine plus tobramycin. patients in the piperacillin plus gentamicin group experienced significantly more renal tubular damage whereas those who received imipenem suffered more nausea or vomiting. superinfections and toxicity related to antibiotics were minimal in both groups. the initial clinical response rate to ceftriaxone/gentamicin was 62.5% and 84.6% to imipenem/cilastatin (p = 0.075). the two groups were equivalent with respect to clinical and laboratory parameters prior to antibiotic therapy and flucloxacillin was added to approximately 25% of the patients in each group on the clinical suspicion of gram positive infection. there was no difference in clinical response between the two therapeutic regimens as assessed 4 and 7 days after treatment began. the difference in distribution proved to be statistically significant for gram-negative (p = 0.0001) as well as gram-positive (p = 0.025) bacteria, indicating that ciprofloxacin effectively prevented the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria and may have contributed to the relatively large number of gram-positive bacteria isolated. single-agent therapy with imipenem is as effective as more conventional combination antibiotic therapy for the empirical treatment of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with cancer. therapy with the combination resulted in a higher serum creatinine (p less than 0.001) and a lower potassium level (p less than 0.001) in comparison with monotherapy. ceftazidime alone was as effective but safer than the combination of piperacillin and tobramycin for the empiric treatment of febrile, neutropenic patients, even those with profound and prolonged granulocytopenia. treatment was successful without the need for modifications in 71% of the episodes in the t group and 81% in the c+a group (p=0.23). the proportion of patients that became afebrile in the first 24 hours was significantly higher in the cefepime group (41.7% vs 11.1%, respectively; p = 0.012). there was no statistically significant difference in the response to treatment at 72 hr or after necessary antimicrobial modifications. there were no significant differences in terms of efficacy between imipenem/cilastatin and amikacin plus piperacillin but a consistent trend towards higher rates of clinical cure or improvement and of elimination of causative pathogens was noted in the imipenem/cilastatin group. isolated bacteria were more sensitive to ceftazidime than to tobramycin with amoxycillin/ampicillin. duration of fever was significantly shorter in the imi group (4 days vs 7 days, p < 0.04). there was no significant difference in terms of success or failure between the two treatment groups. seventy-two hours after the start of therapy, no significant between-group differences in treatment outcomes, including withdrawals or deaths, were seen. there was no difference between the two regimens for durations of fever, neutropenia, and hospitalization (p > .05 for all categories). the initial clinical response rate for both regimens was 60% (p > 0.05). in group i, clinical response was observed in 10 of 19 febrile episodes (52.6%) treated with carbenicillin plus gentamicin and in 10 of 14 (71.4%) treated with latamoxef (p greater than 0.05). only minor reversible side effects were noted in both treatment arms. there was no statistically significant difference between the three treatment regimens with respect to efficacy, safety and tolerance (chi2 test, p>0.05), but while the third and fourth generation cephalosporins + aminoglycosides were comparable for cost, the monotherapy regimen was the most expensive. adverse events were minimal, and three early deaths were observed at days 9, 16, and 16 among patients treated with a single antibiotic and three in the combination regimen group at days 14, 15, and 20. glycopeptide and antifungal drugs were added more frequently in the ceftazidime + amikacin group. there was no difference with respect to the final response: 53% for the monotherapy group versus 48% for the combination group, and both regimens appeared to be equally safe. the long term response to ceftazidime was 33/71 (46.5 per cent) and to cefotaxime + tobramycin 31/86 (36 per cent). a total of 733 patients were assessable for efficacy of the drug regimens, and an overall successful outcome was reported in 49% (179 of 364) of the patients who received monotherapy, compared with 53% (196 of 369) of patients who received combination therapy (p=.2). the response rate regarding gram-negative infections was 10 out of 14 (71%) in the ipm/cs group and seven out of 12 (58%) in the lmox+tob group. clinical cure or improvement was noted in 10 of 12 culture verified infections in the tobramycin and cefuroxime group and 11 of 14 episodes in the ceftazidime-group. cefepime was demonstrated to be an effective and safe treatment for febrile episodes in neutropenic patients with malignancies, and its lack of nephrotoxicity compared to p+g was noteworthy. gram-positive bacteremia responded poorly in the meropenem and ceftazidime/amikacin group (29% versus 25%), whereas all gram-negative bacteremias responded except for one in the meropenem group caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa. no significant difference was found between piperacillin/ tazobactam and ceftazidime plus amikacin in terms of success rate (81% versus 83%), empirical addition of vancomycin (42% versus 38%), median time to fever defervescence (3.3 versus 2.9 days) or median duration of antibiotic therapy (7.2 versus 7.4 days). monotherapy with pip/tazo was effective and safe for initial empirical treatment of febrile neutropenic episodes in children with al. piperacillin-tazobactam monotherapy is significantly more effective and cost-efficient than ceftriaxone plus gentamicin as first-line therapy in febrile neutropenic patients with hematological malignancies. success without modification at the end of treatment was seen in 32.7% (c), 28.3% (c + g), 52.4% (c + t) and 65.2% (c + g + t). fewer adverse effects occurred in the piperacillin-treated group (42%) than in the combination-treated group (71%) (p = 0.0399 by fisher's exact test), although neither nephrotoxicity nor hypokalemia alone was significantly less frequent in patients receiving piperacillin. the success rate with unmodified therapy was not significantly different between the meropenem group (72%) and the ceftazidime-plus-amikacin group (57%). there were 18 cures in the cefepime group and 17 in the ceftriaxone plus amikacin group (p = 0.9). the solid tumor group had significantly less bacteremia (4/34 versus 17/56; p < 0.05) and treatment failure (3/34 versus 24/56; p < 0.001) than the nhl group. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> both adults and children patients aged 2-16 years with hematological malignancies who had febrile neutropenia 1,034 randomized patients, 958 were assessable in the intent-to-treat analysis for response to antibacterial therapy, including 483 in the meropenem group and 475 in the children with cancer and neutropenia febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic disorders febrile neutropenic patients with lung cancer ninety episodes of neutropenic fever in children (0.7-16.0;

individual body image (p = 0.006, d = 0.44), and vo(2)max/kg (p < 0.001, d = 0.50), whereas no improvements were observed in the wg. patients in the ty group reported significantly lower sleep disturbance scores during follow-up compared with patients in the wait-list control group (5.8 vs. 8.1; p < 0.004). we also found borderline significant interactions for physical well-being, satisfaction with life, and flexibility. there were also trends for group differences, in the hypothesized directions, for the psychosocial variables of emotional irritability, gastrointestinal symptoms, cognitive disorganization, mood disturbance, tension, depression, and confusion (all p's <0.10). only the cam group showed increases in measures of spiritual integration (p=0.001) which were also significant between groups (p=0.003). exercise was not associated with quality of life benefits in the full sample of either study; however exercise was associated with improved social functioning among post-treatment survivors who reported low social functioning at baseline (p<0.05). the yoga group had lower morning and 5 p.m. salivary cortisol and improved emotional well-being and fatigue scores. results showed that participants in the intervention group showed greater improvement in fatigue, energy level, and emotional distress at 3-month follow-up, and physical quality of life at postintervention, compared with the participants in the control group. a differential impact of the intervention on the strength and health subscale was observed for older women (>50 years old) in the treatment group (p = 0.03). the global qol was lower than in general population (69.4 vs 74.7, p<0.001). no group differences were found in the changing scores over time. fatigue and global health scores improved in both groups during the intervention (fatigue: training group 21%, relaxation group 19%; global health of both groups 19%, p for all < or =0.01); however, there was no significant difference between changes in the scores of both groups (p=0.67). the fatigue score decreased by 17.0 points in the control group compared with only 5.8 points in the intervention group (p < .01). the results revealed statistically significant increases in aerobic capacity (p < 0.001) and lower-body flexibility (p = 0.027), a significant decrease in body fat (p < 0.001), and a significant increase in quality of life (p < 0.001) and a measure of energy (p = 0.038) in the exercise group when compared with the control group. exercise group scores on the psqi decreased significantly over time (indicating improved sleep quality), although scores did not change significantly within the control group. a behavior change intervention for breast cancer survivors based on the social cognitive theory is feasible and results in potentially meaningful improvements in physical activity and selected health outcomes. self-esteem did not change significantly. patients in the exercise group reported significant improvements in sleep quality (beta = -3.54, p < 0.01) and the mental health dimension of quality of life (beta = 10.48, p < 0.01). in response to training, qol, vo2peak (mean 3.9 ml/kg/min; 95 % ci, 0.93, 6.90) performance in leg press (17.9 kg; 95 % ci, 12.8, 22.4) and sit-stand test (- 0.67 s; 95 % ci, - 0.52, - 1.2) improved (p < or = 0.05). the lifestyle intervention elicited improvements in exercise behavior (p=.068), fatigue (p=.005), aerobic exercise tolerance (p=.010), chair sit-to-stand performance (p=.003), and waist-to-hip ratio (p=.002).

p = .0003). the same incidence (3.6%) of dyskaryotic smears was found using the ayre spatula (74/2077) as the aylesbury spatula (72/2003). correct methods of sampling are essential for obtaining adequate smears for cytological diagnosis of cervicovaginal abnormalities. endocervical cells were found more often and in greater numbers with cytobrush, also in women over 50 years of age. a lower quality of smear was reflected by a lower incidence of epithelial atypical changes found, both between sample takers and by a single sample taker over a period of time. the multispatula had a significantly higher percentage of smears containing endocervical cells than the ayre spatula. at the first screening, a significantly higher number of epithelial abnormalities was found in smears with endocervical columnar cells than in smears without endocervical columnar cells. the adequacy of ectocervical smears, as measured by the presence of columnar cells or squamous metaplasia, differed significantly among the four techniques studied. there was an increased detection of endocervical cells in pregnant patients with both the cytobrush and modified ayers spatula (90.7%) and the cervex-brush (83.3%) methods, compared with the cotton swab and modified ayers spatula (70.8%) (p = .0001 and p = .0233, respectively). red blood cells were more often present in smears taken with the armovical spatula than with the ayre spatula. the presence or absence of endocervical cells in a smear was not significantly associated with any variation in success rate (chi (2)1 = 0.959, p > 0.30). the zelsmyr cytobrush cell collector is an effective instrument, yielding increased numbers of endocervical cells on papanicolaou smear. no difference was found between the methods with regard to detection of dyskaryosis, although there were significant differences in the percentage of smears containing endocervical cells. in swabbed postmenopausal women, use of a milex spatula had a significantly higher yield than the use of a wooden spatula and a cotton-tipped applicator (43 percent vs 27 percent, p less than .03). no significant difference was found in the proportion of smears containing one or other type of indicator cell or in the yield of abnormal smears. a significantly higher number of moderately and severely atypical epithelial changes was found in smears with endocervical cells as compared with smears without endocervical cells. selecting which cervices should be samples ectocervically and which need combined sampling does not significantly improve the yield over ectocervical sampling alone. for pregnant patients smear quality was improved with both cytobrush-spatula and bayne pap brush versus cotton swab-spatula among smears obtained with the spatula plus swab, the rate of any pathology was higher in smears that contained endocervical cells than in smears in which endocervical cells were absent (2.0 versus 0.6%; p = .009). the results of three quality control measures for evaluating a cytopathology laboratory's performance in the diagnosis of cervical abnormalities are presented. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> eligible patients had a cervix and were not pregnant 352 pregnant women undergoing initial obstetric evaluation 402 papanicolaou smears remaining patients with normal colposcopy 130 cervical cytology six hundred fifty-four papanicolaou smears women attending the department of genitourinary medicine during a 16 month period 856 patients who had received local therapy (co2 laser or cold coagulation) for cin ii or iii between 9 and 30 months earlier genitourinary medicine clinic older woman and from those with iatrogenic scarring of the cervix 192 patients, 149 were premenopausal (15 of whom were pregnant), 12 were perimenopausal, and 31 were postmenopausal 856 patients 130 had histologically proven persistent cin cervical cytology laboratories one hundred ninety-six (59 percent) of 332 ectocervical smears obtained with a curved brush were adequate compared with 190 (59 percent) of 323 ectocervical smears obtained with a spatula 36,853 papanicolaou smears more than 17,000 smears were taken from women aged 14-86 years by more than 200 smear takers from 74 centres 280 paired cervical smears los angeles county + university of southern california 89 patients who underwent repeat smear and colposcopic examinations because of abnormal screening smears 533 women who were attending a colposcopy clinic either for investigation of cytological abnormality or for review after treatment of cin two thousand fifteen patients undergoing routine cervical smears at the university of tennessee obstetrics and gynecology clinics 1063 patients referred for colposcopy with a recent abnormal smear 236 patients 10 pregnant patients (40%) and 14 of 18 postmenopausal patients (78%) contained endocervical cells.(abstract truncated at 250 words 107 women persistent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin 203 patients with a history of cryosurgery, laser ablation or cone biopsy were randomized into two groups: 114 patients had cervical smears done with a cotton swab and 89 patients with an endocervical brush patients after treatment for cervical dysplasia 358 women were reported collected 346 smears over a 6-month period, 110 with the cervex brush, 125 with the cotton swab plus ayre spatula and 111 with the cytobrush plus ayre spatula women participating in a cervical cancer screening program, a group of women was selected whose smears theoretically should have contained endocervical columnar cells 158 women who previously had abnormal smears and had been referred to colposcopy clinics in the lewisham and north southwark health authority of london 11,061 patients vaginal smears 192 patients, ranging in age from 18 to 82 yr, were referred to the gynecologic/oncologic clinic for follow-up of an atypical papanicolaou smear or of a previously diagnosed and treated cervical, vulvar, or endometrial lesion participants were all nonpregnant patients referred to the colposcopy clinic for abnormal papanicolaou smears 982 women of childbearing age 802 women at initial follow-up after laser treatment of cervical lesions, 421 smears prepared using the cervex brush were compared with 381 smears prepared using the combination of a doctors in denmark papanicolaou smears women's hospital colposcopy clinic patients with abnormal cytology pregnant women <INPUT_END>

showed a significant decrease, whereas no effect was observed after the period of usual daily activities (anova). exercise and social contact both resulted in significant reductions in both the total and the psychological subscale of the beck depression inventory (bdi). in the first trial, an aerobic exercise group had a superior outcome compared with a control group in terms of trait anxiety and a standard psychiatric interview. at 10 weeks a significantly higher proportion of the exercise group (55% v. 33%) experienced a greater than 30% decline in depression according to hrsd (or=2.51, p=0.05, 95% ci 1.00-6.38). exercise as a behavioural approach to treatment of depression in nursing home residents with severe ad evidenced a clear benefit to participants in this study. there were trends for the superiority of the exercise and sertraline conditions over usual care in improving sf-36 mental health scores and clinician-rated depression scores. secondary outcome measures were the inventory of depressive symptoms (clinician and self-report), hrsd scores at 24 weeks, cardiorespiratory fitness, self-efficacy, and quality of life. in the control group ham-d, gaf and cgi scores do not show any statistically significant differences between t0 and t8. quality of life subscales of bodily pain (p = .001), vitality (p = .002), social functioning (p = .008), and role emotional (p =

than did the subjects in either of the other conditions (p less than .002 in both cases) and that the subjects in the aerobic exercise condition evidenced reliably greater decreases in depression than did subjects in the placebo condition (p = .05) or subjects in the no-treatment condition (p = .001). after 10 days, reduction of depression scores in the exercise group was significantly larger than in the placebo group (brms: 36% v 18%; ces-d: 41% v 21%; p for both = 0.01); the proportion of patients with a clinical response (reduction in the brms scores by more than six points) was also larger for the exercise group (65% v 22%, p<0.01). winter depression responded equally well to exercising and light, while a significant therapeutic difference in favor of exercising was found in non-seasonal depression. all treatment groups had lower ham-d scores after treatment; scores for the active treatment groups were not significantly different from the placebo group (p = .23). after 16 weeks of treatment, the groups did not differ statistically on ham-d or bdi scores (p = .67); adjustment for baseline levels of depression yielded an essentially identical result. <INPUT_END>

and tcpo2 differed significantly during six steps. ancova revealed significant group differences in subscales of the ncafs (n = 20) experienced significantly less stress, as evidenced by smaller decreases in transcutaneous oxygen pressure levels, less time spent crying, and smaller increases in heart rate, than infants circumcised in an identical manner without anesthetic (n = 10). the results showed a significant difference in the heart rate between the treated and untreated group, but the respiratory rate and oxygen saturation levels did not differ significantly. newborns in the untreated placebo group exhibited homogeneous responses that consisted of sustained elevation of heart rate and high-pitched cry throughout the circumcision and following. infants receiving lidocaine in a dorsal penile nerve block (dpnb) remained more attentive to animate and inanimate stimuli following circumcision and demonstrated a greater ability to quiet themselves when disturbed. physiologic and behavioral parameters indicated significantly (p < 0.05) decreased pain response in all treatment groups compared with that in the control group. fifty-six percent of infants circumcised with the mogen clamp and dpnb did not cry at all during the procedure. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> infant rats infants undergoing circumcisions with 1 level iii nursery at a midwestern hospital infants undergoing circumcision normal newborn nursery in a university teaching hospital fifty-eight neonates 48 healthy, full-term infants fifty infants >/=341/2 weeks postmenstrual age and stable for discharge at time of circumcision;

p = 0.02)]. dissections cause approximately three per cent of non-haemorrhagic stroke and are usually observed in young and middle-aged patients. the follow-up investigations moreover demonstrated that intracranial haemodynamics may change from day to day in patients suffering from internal carotid artery dissection. angiographic findings can verify this diagnosis, showing various signs of eccentric, narrowing stenosis, false lumen, pseudoaneurysms, or complete occlusion. doppler ultrasound screening of young patients presenting with stroke, identified 10 patients with reduced common and internal carotid blood flow without any evidence of atheroma. among the patients studied, 82% were caucasian, 53% were male and the average age was 41.7 years old. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> blunt vascular injuries of the head and neck patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery thirteen patients had accompanying closed head injuries primary headaches and painful spontaneous cervical artery dissection women were younger than men extracranial internal carotid artery dissections: noniatrogenic traumatic lesions 68 patients four hundred fifty-nine patients (mean age 44.0 patients suffering from internal carotid artery dissection anticoagulated patients was bi 92 the records from 1976 to 1995 of 24 patients who had 28 33 consecutive eicad patients initially treated either with anticoagulation (n = 25) or with antiplatelets (n = 8), a standardized interview was performed after 28 patients with cad seven patients, with four major bleeding complications requiring cessation of heparin and blood transfusions young and middle-aged patients 301 finnish patients traumatic injury affecting the extracranial portion of internal carotid artery (17 case reports) (author's transl eighteen patients received eight patients were not anticoagulated, five because of intracranial injuries, two who had surgical cca repairs, and one with an aortic injury nine patients had visual symptoms or headache, 10 had transient focal neurologic symptoms (tia), and five had stroke patients with spontaneous dissection of the cervical carotid artery (sicad 298 patients twenty-nine bhvi in 23 patients were reviewed from 1989 to 1997 twenty-two adult trauma patients were diagnosed with bci, for an incidence of 0.45% in the 8-year study period sixteen patients (80%) survived, the majority with normal neurologic function patients with carotid and vertebral artery dissections (cad, vad), (2 seventeen patients who had 19 icad underwent a duplex scan at the time of presentation 22 patients who presented with bci and assessed neurologic and survival outcomes on the basis of injury grade and treatment with anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy 457 survivors, 25 (5.5%) could not be contacted in 2002 because they had moved 301 consecutive finnish patients, diagnosed from 1994 to 2007 nine patients with dissections of the cervical arteries thirteen patients (57%) had no or minimal deficits upon discharge blunt vascular injuries to the head and neck (bhvi 54 consecutive patients patients with closed head injuries and carotid canal fractures patients with dissection of cervical arteries (dca 4 patients with ion (2 anterior and 2 posterior) due to internal carotid artery dissection of a consecutive series of 110 patients with internal carotid artery dissection (3.6 between april 1976 and april 1986, cervicocephalic arterial dissections were diagnosed in 19 of 4531 patients undergoing cerebral arteriography for acute cerebrovascular symptoms 17 cases reports of traumatic injury affecting the extracranial portion of internal carotid artery patients with this injury thirteen patients received only medical therapy, and six had surgery young adults patients who have icad often have prodromal symptoms before stroke six patients (five men and one woman) 31 to 62 years old six patients subsequently had an operation for residual occlusive disease or aneurysm multiethnic population one patient presented only with a painful post-ganglionic horner syndrome, another patient with neck pain and post-ganglionic horner syndrome, another patient solely with protracted unilateral headaches, three with transient ischemic attacks (tia), and 21 with ischemic strokes 38 patients with acute stroke following occlusion due to cad (18 males, 20 females, median age 50.5 years, range 16-82 countries with multiethnic population patients with sdcva from a multiethnic population patients having an ischemic stroke or tias 130 consecutive cases mean age was 35.4 years;

differ between the on-pump and off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting groups. urinary isoprostane ipf2alpha-iii levels, plasma levels of free malondialdehyde, and total antioxidant status were measured before, during, and up to 24 hours after surgery. insulin-like growth factor-1 decreased more (p=0.01) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 increased more (p<0.001) with cardiopulmonary bypass than without. saphenous graft patency was 59% (on pump) versus 49% (off pump; p=ns). significant increases from prior anesthesia values of lipid hydroperoxides (190% at 4 hours), protein carbonyls (250% at 0.5 hours) and nitrotyrosine (510% at 0.5 hours) were seen in the cpb group, but they were abolished or significantly reduced in the off-pump group. the length of stay in icu was significantly different: 33.8+/-16.2 hours for group early mortality was 2.3% in group 1 and 3.4% in group 2 (p = not significant). aspartate transaminase and alanine-amino transferase levels were higher in the cabg-cpb group for the first postoperative day, but levels converged by day 3 (interaction of surgery type and time; p < 0.0001 and p = 0.04, respectively). a certain degree of roteg signs of fibrinolysis was noticed at time t2 in both groups and in group b these marks were quite widely, but not significantly expressed (p for intergroup differences for lysis on set time at 60 and 150 minutes were p = 0.190 and p = 0.122, respectively), borderline differences were found for maximum clot firmness (p = 0.082) with a lower mean value for group b (arithmetic means patients undergoing opcab had more severely stenosed carotid arteries (p=0.075), higher incidence of slightly diseased ascending aorta (p=0.087) and higher northern new england cardiovascular study group troponin i was significantly lower in the opcab than in the ccab group, either at the end of ischemia, end of surgery, 6-hour and 24-hour postoperatively (4 +/- a residual perfusion defect at myocardial nuclear scan was less frequent among patients in the mecc group (3 versus 9 cases, p=0.14; odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.07 to 1.32). the mean static and dynamic lung compliance postoperatively was lower in the stabilization group, although not statistically significant (p = 0.06). statistically significant differences were found between the 2 groups concerning the incidence of low cardiac output syndrome (p = .001), time of inotrope drugs support (p = .001), time of mechanical ventilation (p = .006), reoperation for bleeding (p = .04), intensive care unit stay (p = .01), and in-hospital stay (p = .02). cd11b levels were significantly higher in the cpb group at 60 minutes (p = .002). the lactate/pyruvate ratio and the lactate/glucose ratio, indicating the aerobic and anaerobic tissue metabolism status, were lower in the off-pump group. the response of t lymphocytes and their activation markers, as well as b lymphocytes and their activation markers, was similar after on- and off-pump surgery. interleukin-6, interleukin-8, c3a, and troponin i levels after surgery were significantly higher in the cpb group compared with the off-pump and rvad groups. troponin-t and creatine kinase isoenzyme mb (ck-mb) levels were significantly higher in cpb procedures (p<0.0056; multivariate general linear model). thirty-day complications, neuropsychological functioning, and one-year clinical and functional outcomes were not statistically different between the two techniques. compared to baseline levels the highest ptx3 value (p<0.000) was attained on the 1(st) postoperative day in both "on-pump" and "off-pump" patients. the extent and pattern of svr index responses were similar in both groups (p = 0.840). the off-pump coronary artery bypass graft group had fewer patients with troponin release than the conventional coronary artery bypass graft group. there was no significant difference in the median postoperative length of stay between the two groups (seven days in each group). cec numbers and proportions of apoptotic hec were significantly elevated during and after surgery in both groups (p<0.01). the mean intraoperative s100 in the on-pump group was 1.6 times greater compared to that in the off-pump group (95% ci 0.88-2.8; p=0.01). thrombin formation was more elevated in the on-pump group (p < .001), particularly during the operation; prothrombin fragment 1.2 discharge values were higher than the preoperative ones (p = .002). plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) levels significantly increased with respect to baseline from protamine administration up to eight postoperative days, whereas high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-crp) and fibrinogen increased after surgery up to eight postoperative days in both groups. the total amount of cardiac troponin i released was higher in the arrested heart revascularization group than in the beating heart revascularization group (8.25 +/- maximum creatine kinase-mb levels were significantly (p=0.046) lower in the off-pump group than in the on-pump group (17.1+/-16.7 iu/l versus 21.5+/-10.6 iu/l). opcab was followed by an attenuated systemic release of il-8 there was no mortality or perioperative myocardial infarction in either group. the rate of active cd97-positive lymphocytes showed a marked, gradual increase until postoperative day 3 and remained elevated up to day 7 after cpb. preoperative characteristics were comparable between the two groups. fibrinogen and t-pa levels increased postoperatively in both the groups when compared with baseline values. cardiopulmonary bypass, inclusive of cardioplegic arrest, is the main independent predictor of post-operative gastrointestinal complications in patients undergoing coronary revascularisation. compared with base line, opcab patients performed better on the rey auditory verbal learning test (total and recognition scores) at both 2 weeks and at 1 year (p < or = 0.05), whereas cabg performance was statistically unchanged for all cognitive measures. levels of creatine kinase mass were statistically higher in the miniaturized extracorporeal circulation group than in the off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting group, but only at the end of the operation (p < .0001). no significant differences between cabg and opcab were detected in postoperative vo(2), do(2), and exo(2) levels. peak s100 levels were four times higher in group a than in group b (2.1 microg/l versus 0.5 microg/l; p < 001). there were no significant intergroup differences in any of the echocardiographic markers of right ventricular function. however, in multivariate analysis fibrosis was confounded by myocyte vacuolization (p = .002) and nuclear derangement (p = .016), representing independent atrial fibrillation predictors. postoperative s-100 serum levels were: 3.76 (0.13 to 11.2) microg/l (conventional) versus 0.13 (0.04 to 1.01) microg/l (off-pump), p less than 0.0001. no significant difference in myeloperoxydase content was noted; however, elastase was significantly higher in the two ec (on-pump) groups. global oxygen utilization measurements showed superior do(2) and vo(2) in the opcab group throughout the study. there were no differences in exercise capacity improvement and attenuation of symptoms between the groups. plasma levels of complement (c3a), cytokines (il-8, tnf-alpha), endothelin-1 and neopterin were measured before and during surgery and 2 and 24 h after surgery. cardiac outcomes and health-related quality of life at 30 days and 1 year were similar and patients incurred a lower cost. the platelet activity is higher in the early postoperative period in off-pump compared with on-pump coronary artery bypass grafting. forced vital capacity (fvc) values were significantly lower than the preoperative values in all three groups (p < 0.05). patients who underwent off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery showed similar patency of grafts, better clinical outcome, shorter hospital stay, and better neurocognitive function than patients who underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting surgery using cardiopulmonary bypass. in low-risk patients undergoing cabg surgery, avoiding the use of cardiopulmonary bypass had no effect on 5-year cognitive or cardiac outcomes. all-cause mortality was significantly increased in the off-pump group (24% vs 15%; hr 1.66, 95% ci 1.02 to 2.73; p=0.04), but cardiac-related death was not significantly different (10% vs 7%; hr 1.30, 95% ci 0.64 to 2.66; p=0.47). no mortality or renal complication were observed. protein s100 levels were higher in the cabg-cpb than in the opcab group 1 hour after surgery (p<0.001). the proportions of neuropsychologic deficits and improvement in quality-of-life were comparable regardless of whether patients were randomized to receive off-pump coronary artery bypass graft surgery or conventional coronary artery graft surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. gsh levels from the biopsies were increased in the perfusion group early in the reperfusion time showing that myocardial tissue was well protected and recovered more rapidly after cross-clamping than after the occlusion of the coronary arteries. graft occlusion was more likely at the distal than the proximal anastomosis (odds ratio, 1.11; 95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.20). the off-pump group had significantly less increase in creatinine levels when compared with the on-pump group (p<.05). there was no diference between the two groups of patients regarding incidence of main morbidity and hospital moratlity. coronary revascularization with cpb was associated with a significant expression increase in the tnf-system and sil-2r when compared to the opcab patients. the maximum myocardial lactate production was significantly higher (p = 0.02) in the group operated with cpb (0.56 mmol/l) than without it (0.17 mmol/l). the on-pump group showed a significantly greater deterioration in scores for two and three tests at 1 week and 10 weeks postoperatively, respectively, than the off-pump group. interstitial lactate levels were higher during off-pump surgery (p<0.05). at 1 year of follow-up, patients in the off-pump group had worse composite outcomes and poorer graft patency than did patients in the on-pump group. in the group that underwent minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting, leukocyte elastase, platelet beta-thromboglobulin, and complement c3a were unchanged at the end of the procedure compared with their baseline concentrations, whereas these inflammatory markers were increased significantly in the group that underwent conventional coronary artery bypass grafting with cardiopulmonary bypass. values were less important in the opcab group and return to the baseline was faster than in the cpb group. there were no hospital deaths in off-pump patients, and 2 patients (5%) undergoing onpump cabg died early following surgery (p =.2). the wbc and neutrophil counts rose markedly in both groups following the operation and remained at this increased level during the observation period. off-pump cabg is potentially associated with reduced intraoperative blood loss and homologous blood transfusion in comparison to on-pump cabg. at 6 months after revascularization, 57% (343 of 611) of dysfunctional segments improved contraction by at least 1 grade. postoperative systemic arterial et levels were significantly increased by 200% in the cpb group and 50% in the opcab group. there were no significant differences between on-pump and off-pump patients in any of the eight subscales at both stages. ck-mb mass release was 323.5+/-221.2 microg/l (24 h postoperatively) in operated patients without cpb and 1030. i, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein released was significantly higher in the on-pump group than in the off-pump group. clinical outcome and hospital stay were comparable in both groups. fibrin d dimer and prothrombin fragment 1+2 concentrations were lower during surgery in the off-pump group (p < 0.001). we did not find any statistical difference in hospital mortality and morbidity using on-pump or off-pump techniques for low-risk patients. after 5-year follow-up, the primary composite end point was not different between groups (hazard ratio 0.71, 95% ci 0.41 to 1.22; p=0.21). glutathione peroxidase levels were not changed according to blood collection times in both of cabg group or opcab group (p > 0.05). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients undergoing

lipids appeared to be unaffected by either agent. at the end of follow-up, between the two groups there was no significant difference in total serum cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, hba1c, fasting serum glucose, or plasma insulin. office blood pressure was significantly lower in the candesartan group at follow-up than in the placebo group. during a mean follow-up of 4.3 yr, active treatment reduced the risk for renal events by 21% (p < 0.0001), which was driven by reduced risks for developing microalbuminuria and macroalbuminuria (both p < 0.003). neither drug showed any negative side effects on fasting plasma glucose and glycated hemoglobin (hba1c) levels, and both maintain constant aers. no difference was observed in change in creatinine clearance or serum creatinine from baseline between the two groups. microalbuminuria in diabetes is strongly predictive of nephropathy, end-stage renal disease, and premature cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. reduction in systolic blood pressure (24-h systolic blood pressure) reduction was obtained in both treatment arms (mean reduction at final follow-up: dual blockade 6 mmhg vs. lisinopril 2 mmhg), but no significant difference was found between dual-blockade and lisinopril 40 mg once daily (p = 0.10). although no difference was demonstrated in creatinine clearance (p = 0.43), a lower percentage of patients in the intensive group progressed from normoalbuminuria to microalbuminuria (p = 0.012) and microalbuminuria to overt albuminuria (p = 0.028). treatment with enalapril was associated with a greater reduction in albuminuria than with nifedipine in the entire patient group, and especially in those with microalbuminuria. bp was significantly decreased in both groups at the end of the 1st and 6th month to a similar extent. versus placebo (46 patients [1.55%]) (hazard ratio, 1.29 [95% ci, 0.87 to 1.89]; in the whole group at baseline, the overnight albumin excretion rate correlated with hba1c (r = 0.50, p < 0.01) and the duration of diabetes (r = 0.39, p < 0.05), and sbp correlated with both the overnight (r = 0.42, p < 0.05) and the exercise-induced (r = 0.48, p < 0.05) albumin excretion rate. slightly fewer patients in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group had nonfatal cardiovascular events--81 of 2232 patients (3.6%) as compared with 91 of 2215 patients (4.1%) (p=0.37)--but a greater number had fatal cardiovascular events--15 patients (0.7%) as compared with 3 patients (0.1%) (p=0.01), a difference that was attributable in part to a higher rate of death from cardiovascular causes in the olmesartan group than in the placebo group among patients with preexisting coronary heart disease (11 of 564 patients [2.0%] vs. 1 of 540 [0.2%], p=0.02). treatment with prazosin gits resulted in a favourable effect on serum triglycerides at the end of 8 weeks (p = 0.017) and 16 weeks (p = 0.011), and no detrimental effect or a marginal beneficial effect on total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and ldl cholesterol. the increase in urinary albumin excretion was less with telmisartan (p=0.004) or with combination therapy (p=0.001) than with ramipril. no significant changes were observed concerning other clinical and biochemical features between the two antihypertensive therapies and particularly hba1c, bmi, triglycerides, and cholesterol plasma values. on intention-to-treat analysis at 2 years, aer was 2.2 micrograms/min lower in the lisinopril than in the placebo group, a percentage difference of 18.8% (95% ci 2.0-32.7, p = 0.03), adjusted for baseline aer and centre, absolute difference 2.2 micrograms/min. early blockade of the renin-angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes did not slow nephropathy progression but slowed the progression of retinopathy. during treatment, a

patients showed a trend toward reduced all-cause hospitalizations and total hospital days. more intervention-group than usual-care patients remained event-free (38 vs 51; p=0.04). a nurse based management programme is more effective than follow up in primary care in optimising medication for elderly patients with heart failure. the one year survival rate was 71.8% (n = 79) in the control group and 70.0% (n = 56) in the intervention group (ns). this comprehensive hospital discharge and outpatient management program prolonged time to first event, reduced hospital readmissions, improved survival and quality of life of patients hospitalized for hf, while reducing cost of management. community nurse-supported post-discharge programme was effective in preserving independence and was probably effective in reducing the number of unplanned re-admissions. there were slightly more hospitalizations in the 2 intervention groups (basic intervention group, p = .89; and intensive support group, p = .60). compared with usual care, care at a multidisciplinary specialized congestive heart failure outpatient clinic reduced the number of hospital readmissions and hospital days and improved quality of life. there were 81 all-cause hospital readmissions in the intervention group and 82 in the control group (p = ns). to determine whether a telephone-mediated nurse care management program for heart failure reduced the rate of rehospitalization for heart failure and for all causes over a 1-year period. c+hbi was associated with a non-significant, 45% reduction in the risk of death or readmission when adjusting for potential confounders (rr 0.55, 95% ci 0.28-1.08: p=0.08). there were fewer patients with events (death or admission) after 12 months in the intervention group compared to the control group (29 vs 40, p=0.03) and fewer deaths after 12 months (7 vs 20, p=0.005). a comprehensive transitional care intervention for elders hospitalized with heart failure increased the length of time between hospital discharge and readmission or death, reduced total number of rehospitalizations, and decreased healthcare costs, thus demonstrating great promise for improving clinical and economic outcomes. patients allocated to usual-care management showed heterogeneous changes in nyha functional class (13% improved and 16% worsened p = ns); in contrast, the dh group showed significant changes in nyha functional class (23% improved and 11% worsened, p < 0.009). there were 43 chf hospital admissions and 7 deaths in the intervention group, as compared with 59 chf hospital admissions and 13 deaths in the nonintervention group (p = 0.09). this community pharmacist intervention did not lead to reductions in hospital admissions in contrast to those found in trials of specialist nurse led interventions in heart failure. the intervention was associated with a 39% decrease in the total number of readmissions (intervention group: 49 readmissions; control group: 80 readmissions, p = 0.06). ace inhibitor use increased from 58% on admission to 83% at discharge (p < .0001), and the daily dose (in enalapril equivalents) increased from 11.3 +/- no differences were recorded in quality of life, but the intervention group had a higher score in the satisfaction scale at two months [9.0 (sd=1.3) versus 8.2 (sd=1.8) p=0.026]. the 3 dimensions of quality of life improved after hospitalization in both groups, with no differences between intervention and control group as measured at each follow-up measurement. there was no significant difference between the intervention and control groups for the combined end-point of death or hospital readmission. at 1-year follow-up, 62 of the 137 patients (45.3%) in the intervention group had been readmitted or died, compared with 75 of the 142 (52.8%) in the control group, (relative risk=0.86, p=.232). dmp patients reported, compared to baseline, significant improvements in functional status, quality of life and beta-blocker prescription rate. compared with usual care, patients in the intervention group had fewer readmissions for any reason (86 v 114, p=0.018), fewer admissions for heart failure (19 v 45, p<0.001) and spent fewer days in hospital for heart failure (mean 3.43 v 7.46 days, p=0.0051). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> heart failure (coach low-risk patients with heart failure two

risperidone (6 mg) was superior to haloperidol on the total panss, general psychopathology, and brief psychiatric rating scale subscales. quetiapine was no different from placebo across the dose range studied regarding incidence of extrapyramidal symptoms or change in prolactin concentrations. propericiazine at 10 mg and 30 mg also increased the number of symptom-free days dose-dependently but at

extra-pyramidal side effects (measured by the extrapyramidal symptom rating scale) was significantly higher in patients treated with 16 mg of risperidone or 20 mg of haloperidol than placebo. at the end of the 3-year trial, both chlorpromazine and haloperidol significantly prolonged the remission state as compared to the other three drugs. the overall results indicated that the 5 mg and 2 mg

95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.70-1.46). there were no consistent or significant differences in the sickness experience of the subjects receiving the sustained-release vitamin capsules compared to those receiving the vitamin tablets, but subjects in both vitamin groups experienced less severe illness than subjects in the placebo group, with approximately 25 per cent fewer days spent indoors because of the illness (p smaller than 0.05). no side effects of substantive changes in serum biochemistry could be attributed to the vitamin c dose. none of the groups receiving vitamin c showed a difference in sickness experience that was statistically significant from that of the placebo groups, but the results obtained were compatible with an effect of small magnitude from both the prophylactic and therapeutic regimens, and an effect of somewhat greater magnitude from the combination regimen. the group taking d-isoascrobic acid suffered 34% fewer colds than the other two groups; the results were also analyzed in relation to the sex and smoking habits of the volunteers. no proven biochemical effects were obtained. children receiving vitamin c had fewer throat cultures yielding beta-hemolytic streptococcus (six versus 13, p less than 0.10), but no difference in overall complicated illness rate (24 versus 25). compared with the placebo group, the active-treatment group had significantly fewer colds (37 vs 50, p<.05), fewer days challenged virally (85 vs 178), and a significantly shorter duration of severe symptoms (1.8 vs 3.1 days, p<.03). sixty-eight percent of the runners in the placebo group reported the development of symptoms of urt infection after the race; this was significantly more (p < 0.01) than that reported by the vitamin c-supplemented group (33%). no apparent reduction was seen for the severity and duration of the common cold. analysis of these data showed that ascorbic acid had at best only a minor influence on the duration and severity of colds, and that the effects demonstrated might be explained equally well by a break in the double blind. paired comparisons showed no significant overall treatment effect on cold symptoms, but the response was not uniform in all sub-groups. although differences were not significant, the placebo group had the shortest duration of nasal, systemic and overall symptoms, and the lowest mean severity score at 14 days, and the second lowest at 7 and 28 days. among the men who had any colds at all, significantly fewer on active than on placebo treatment had two or more colds;

injection and circumcision periods. although mean recovery time was shorter in the sucrose group (102 seconds), there was neither a significant difference between the groups (10% glucose, 121 seconds; 30% glucose, 109 seconds; control group, 132 seconds [p =.09]), nor was there a difference in maximum heart rate and percent change in heart rate at 1, 2, and 3 minutes after heel prick (p =.14, p =.05, p = the combination of sucrose and emla cream revealed a higher analgesic effect than sucrose alone during venipuncture in these preterm infants. oral sucrose significantly reduced the score of the hl group (58 v 47, p<0.01) and also tended to reduce the score of the vp group (23 v 2, p<0.1). repeated measures analysis of variance (anova) revealed that the sugar-coated pacifier group demonstrated significantly lower vagal tone during heelstick than the oral sucrose solution and control groups. no significant difference was recorded between the sucrose and sterile water groups in the magnitude or latency of the spinal nociceptive reflex withdrawal recorded from the biceps femoris of the stimulated leg. grimacing was reduced to almost naught by procedures that essentially eliminated crying and markedly reduced heart rate during the blood harvesting procedure. there was no difference in mean gestational age at birth, mean birth weight or corrected gestational age at first examination between both groups. infants who received sucrose demonstrated a significantly lower neonatal facial coding score during nasogastric tube passage compared with the placebo group (median 1 (range 0-4) vs 3 (0-4), p = 0.004). the mean pipp score was 8.8 for the sucrose group and 11.4 for the water group ( t = 2.87, p = .008 two-tailed). there was a significant reduction in the duration of first cry, the percentage of time spent crying in the 5 minutes after heel prick, and the pain score in the sucrose treated group. significant differences in pain response existed among treatment groups (f = 22.49, p <.001), with the lowest mean premature infant pain profile scores in the sucrose and nonnutritive sucking group. no differences were determined between the groups for heart rate and oxygen saturation in the newborns during painful interventions (p > 0·05). the participants in the control group had a trend of longer crying time, but this trend did not reach a level of statistical significance. both sucrose groups had lower pipp scores (single sucrose pain scores, 6.8-8.2, p = 0.07; repeated sucrose pain scores, 5.3-6. 2, p < 0.01) than water (pain scores 7.9-9.1), and in the last block, the repeated dose had lower scores than the single dose (6.2 vs. 8. 2, p < 0.05). median crying times were 36, 52, and 62 s in the sucrose, placebo and human milk groups, respectively (p = 0.0009). there were significantly fewer sg neonates crying during a (ass.2), p (ass.2 and ass.4), and d (ass.3). there was no overall treatment effect when using an oral sucrose solution before bladder catheterization in infants younger than 90 days of age. there were significant reductions in crying time, duration of the first cry and tachycardia, time needed for return to baseline heart rate, and the average and 1- and 5-minute nfcs scores in the hindmilk group when compared with the distilled water group. infants randomised to pacifiers scored lower than those without pacifiers (p = 0.003). there was a significant main effect of intervention (p = 0.03) between the sucrose plus pacifier group, and the standard care group (p = 0.01), but there was no main effect of time (p = 0.72). sucrose gave significant (p < .001) the groups that received sucrose alone or in combination with simulated rocking showed less facial actions indicative of pain than the rocking alone or control group. the synergistic effect of the combination of sucrose and non-nutritive sucking was clinically effective and safe in relieving the pain of simple procedures such as venipuncture or heel stick in preterm and term infants, but further research is needed on these interventions alone and in combination with other behavioral interventions in neonates. there was a significant reduction in overall crying time and heart rate after three minutes in the babies given 50% sucrose as compared with controls. repeated use of sucrose analgesia in infants <31 weeks' pca may put infants at risk for poorer neurobehavioral development and physiologic outcomes. sucrose on a pacifier was far more analgesic than water on a pacifier for infants in the gomco group. for 3 of the 5 definitions of pain response, patients experienced significantly less pain at speculum insertion with sucrose than with placebo. two-week-old infants who received either the sterile water or sucrose solution cried significantly less than infants who received no intervention (f=5.92,p<.005). we found that pain scores during intramuscular injection did not differ significantly between the sucrose and placebo groups for newborns of diabetic or nondiabetic mothers (newborns of nondiabetic mothers: mean difference facial grimacing scores were lower in the sucrose group compared with those in the liposomal lidocaine group (mean difference: -27 [95% confidence interval (ci): -36 to -19; p < .001) and for the sucrose plus liposomal lidocaine group compared with those in the liposomal lidocaine group (mean difference: -23 the mean pain scores were 4.60, 5.82, 3.91, 4.94, 5, and 4.05 in groups 1-6, respectively (p= 0.068). nips scores before the heel prick correlated significantly and positively with ct and subsequent nips scores in both the sucrose and the placebo groups. in a double blind cross over study sucrose reduced the pain response of preterm infants exposed to heel prick blood samples only when it was administered into the mouth. the time spent crying was reduced in the group treated with the sweetest solution (s24, n = 8, mean = 19.1 s). no significant differences were seen between groups in physiologic or behavioral responses to the eye exam. neither water nor lactose were effective during or after blood collection. for physiological measures, the interventions interacted with each other and preintervention levels to reduce heart rate and lower vagal tone more during the procedure in infants in whom heart rate and vagal tone were higher before intervention. physiological responses of heart rate and oxygen saturation were not attenuated by sucrose at any time point during or following the blood collection. the increase from before to during heel prick in skin conductance (number and amplitude of the waves) and heart rate correlated with the crying time (p < 0.01). the pacifier with sucrose (f = 24.09, p < .0001) and pacifier with sterile water (f = 9.00, p = .003) significantly reduced pain. there were no group differences in the cortisol response to a painful stimulus or in pulse rate variability over time. there was a significant reduction in crying time and pain score 3 minutes after the painful stimulus in all groups compared with the controls. pain was assessed with the newborn acute pain scale (dan) and with the neonatal facial coding system (nfcs). the duration of crying in response to sampling did not differ in the two groups but was related to level of arousal at the time of stimulation. infants who received water showed increased relative right frontal eeg activation from baseline to the post-heelstroke phase, a pattern that typifies negative affect. insertion of a feeding tube in preterm infants leads to a measurable degree of pain and discomfort, according to the premature infant pain profile assessment tool. differences between group medians for these comparisons were 3 (2 to 5), 3 (1 to 5), and 1 (0 to 2), respectively. median premature infant pain profile scores were lower in the breastfeeding group (3.0) than in the sucrose-solution group (8.5), and the median group difference was -5.0. the comparative analysis between groups of non-nutritive sucking sucrose and placebo showed no significant differences. at 2 and 4 minutes pain scores were lowest in the nns and rocking groups as compared to sucrose, distilled water, expressed breast milk and massage. cerebral blood volume decreased in 5 of 14 infants after sucrose and in 6 of 14 infants after placebo (difference not significant).

patients with metastatic sarcomas, including the ewing sarcoma family of tumors (esft) and rhabdomyosarcoma (rms), the authors tested the feasibility of an intensive regimen supported by granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (g-csf) and peripheral blood stem cells (pbsc). haematological and gastrointestinal toxicities were severe. however, ttp and survival rates remained poor. it is characterized by chromosomal translocation t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2), which results in the fusion of the gene syt on chromosome 18 with ssx genes on chromosome x. heterogeneity within ss fusion junctions is rare. the child remains in complete remission at 36 months after completion of treatment. there were no recurrences or deaths beyond 10 months after diagnosis. reversible grade 4 myelosuppression was the most common toxicity. relapse-free intervals until the 1st, 2nd and 3rd relapses were 40, 19 and 22 months, respectively. median progression-free survival was 19.1 months (range: 0-121) for all patients, and 48.8 months (range: 3-121) for 12 patients with ned. topotecan appears to be relatively unaffected by the most common multidrug resistance mechanisms, may potentiate cytotoxicity of alkylators, has good penetration into the central nervous system, is active against a variety of neoplasms, and has myelosuppression as its paramount toxicity. the uniform survival achieved in our series indicates potential benefit for the combination of dose-intensive multiagent chemotherapy, local irradiation, and aggressive surgical approach in this disease. two years after primary diagnosis, metastases were found in the lung, trunk, gluteus region, upper extremities and brain. the probability of disease-free survival at 2 years after hdct2 in the shg and dhg were 66.7 and

revealed a dose-related increase in maximum plasma concentration (cmax) and area under the curve (auc). eighteen of 49 patients survive event-free 22+ to 55+ months (median, 33+) after transplantation, including nine of 16 treated before recurrence and nine of 33 treated after recurrence. she remains alive and recurrence-free 7 years following the diagnosis of her second intracranial malignancy. median os was 23.7 months (range 12-34) vs 10.8 months (range 0-39), respectively. the response continued to improve with immunotherapy. at a median follow-up of 100.6 months after asct, 11 patients are alive, with nine in sustained complete remission (cr) and each one in partial remission (pr) and stable disease. the total 5-year survival rate of patients with ewing's sarcoma is 65.6%, the total 2-year survival rate of patients with soft tissue sarcomas is 62.2%, and the total 2-year survival rate of children with osteosarcoma is 76%. metastatic seeding to the omentum was most common, followed by spread of disease to liver, distant lymph nodes, lung, and occasionally to scrotum or to ovary. the progression-free survival was similar in three types of transplants (57% abmt, 43% pbsct vs. 50% abmt + pbsct). the ovarian involvement was unilateral in the first patient and bilateral in the second with tumor size ranging from 9 to 11 cm. in these five cases a partial response was observed in two of the three who had measurable response parameters, but all of them died because of disease progression in a short period of time. median time to wbc recovery (greater than or equal to 1,000/microl) was 13 days post-abmt (range, nine to 22 days) and to a platelet count of greater than or equal to 50,000/microl, 22 days (range, 13 to 83 days). five patients received local radiotherapy: three were not assessable for response, but in two patients, antitumor effect was evident. no side effects were observed. the treatment was reasonably well tolerated and both patients are alive with no evidence of disease 52 months and 65 months after the primary diagnosis. he was diagnosed with a large peri-rectal mass and bulky metastases to the peritoneum, omentum and liver. the diagnosis of an intra-abdominal malignancy, most commonly a dsrct, should be considered in the presence of an umbilical mass in a child. this experience confirms that dsrct may be considered a chemosensitive tumour, highly aggressive, with short-lasting response to chemotherapy. a response exceeding 50% was observed in 6/18 patients (response rate 33%). the disease-free survival of children with malignant disorders has increased impressively over the last three decades due to better understanding of tumour biology and the resultant improvement in diagnosis and therapy. neuroleptic malignant syndrome (nms) is a rare disorder characterized by hyperthermia, elevated creatine phosphokinase, extrapyramidal effects, autonomic instability, altered level of consciousness and leukocytosis associated with neuroleptic and other psychotropic medications. radical surgical excision, radiotherapy and peripheral blood stem cell transplantation does not seem to improve prognosis significantly. cytogenetic study showed translocation (9;22)(q34;q11). desmoplastic small round cell tumor (dsrct) is a rare, highly aggressive malignancy with distinctive histologic and immunohistochemical features occurring in a young population with a male predominance. treatment was well tolerated and the patient remains in complete remission at 36+ months. no treatment-related mortality occurred and grade 3 or 4 toxicity was clinically tolerable. overall survival (os) was 63% (95% ci: 47-79%) at 1 year and 33% (95% ci: 16-50%) at 3 years. in some patients pbsc failed to influence engraftment and the use of combined chemotherapy and growth factor priming for pbsc collection may give improved results. high-dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell support reduced the tumor burden and led to a symptom-free interval of 6 months. after high-dose chemotherapy, no complete response conversion was obtained and ews-wt1 fusion transcript detection was positive in the peripheral blood during follow-up in all patients. malignant rhabdoid tumor (mrt) is a rare and highly aggressive tumor that primarily occurs in very young children. further dose escalation was precluded by the development of multiple organ toxicity, including venoocclusive disease, refractory thrombocytopenia, and hypertension. reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction revealed the syt/ssx2 fusion transcript of the synovial sarcoma t(x;18) chromosomal rearrangement. we report a very rapid engraftment after reinfusion of bone marrow cells derived from 'g-csf-primed

noted in the cytogam group compared with the placebo group (15.4% [2/13] vs 60% [6/10], p = .039). opportunistic superinfections (aspergillus fumigatus and pneumocystis carinii) occurred only in patients given placebo. ten patients were excluded from further analysis because of graft loss due to surgical complications, side effects of rifna2c, and because of lack of compliance. no death or graft loss was due to viral infection. the incidence of cmv disease and visceral involvement was much higher in the cmv immunoglobulin group than in the ganciclovir group (40 versus 6%, respectively; p = 0.03). the incidence of cmv disease was 31% in the acv group and 20% in the acv + cmv ig group (n.s.). among those who developed cmv infections, prophylactic igg had no effect on the severity or duration of fever, leukopenia, or hepatic enzyme elevations. cytomegalovirus excretion began earlier and viremia was more frequent in placebo-treated than in interferon-treated patients. cytomegalovirus viremia was detected in 13 of 22 recipients without prophylaxis and in 16 of 22 recipients with cmv-igiv prophylaxis (p = 0.19). incidence of primary cmv infection was equal in both groups (50%) and no influence on the severity of primary cmv infection was seen. cmv disease occurred in fewer patients (n = 28, 21.0%) in the acv group, while significantly more patients (n = 42, 31.6%) in the gcv + hig group developed group developed cmv disease slightly later (2.83 +/- 0.70 months) than those who received gcv/hig (2.15 +/- 0.21 months, p > 0.01). passive immunization completely prevented cmv-related death, although it did not reduce the incidence of cmv isolation, viremia, or disease. there was no difference between groups in terms of survival; episodes of rejection, bacteremia, or fungemia; use of immunosuppressive agents; and incidence of leukopenia or thrombocytopenia. the towne strain of attenuated cmv vaccine was compared with placebo in seronegative renal transplants who later received kidneys from seropositive donors. the incidence of virologically confirmed cmv-associated syndromes was reduced from 60 percent in controls to 21 percent in recipients of cmv immune globulin (p less than 0.01). patients receiving polyimmune gammaglobulin along with n/r-ats had an incidence of infection of only 10%. both prophylactic regimens significantly reduced the incidence of invasive cmv infection (p < .05) and were well tolerated. acyclovir, with or without ivig, did not prevent primary cmv infection or disease in d+r- solid organ transplant recipients at our institution. there were no significant complications related to the intravenous immunoglobulin infusions. the incidence of rejection and graft loss was not different between the two groups. though the clinical manifestation of the disease is lowered by his in cyclosporin-treated patients, there is a higher infection incidence with increased severity in his-treated atg/imurek patients compared to the respective control. serological and cellular immune responses developed in most vaccines but were lower in the transplant patients than in healthy volunteers and some of the seronegative patients failed to mount responses. there were also significantly fewer symptomatic herpes-simplex infections in the treatment (n = 6) than in the control group (n = 25).

control group. long-term relapse rates were not significantly different: intervention group, 50.9%, usual care group, 50.0%.(abstract truncated at 250 words) pregnant smokers attending a local health department wic clinic were randomly assigned to one of two self-help smoking cessation programs or usual care. neither a computerized telephone cessation program nor systematic provision of motivational counseling improved cessation rates over a tailored self-help booklet delivered within the context of brief advice from prenatal providers. twenty percent of intervention subjects and 10% of controls reported cessation, which was verified by co level (p = .052). the magnitude of this difference persisted through late pregnancy (11.8% vs. 4.3%; ns) and delivery (10.6% vs. 4.7%; ns). positive effects of the program on birth weight and length of gestation were present for the offspring of young adolescents (less than 17 years of age) and smokers. at the eighth month of pregnancy, differences between the two groups in salivary thiocyanate level and reported smoking were statistically significant. smoking cessation rates were low: the cotinine validated rates were 18.8% (113/600) in the intervention group and 20.7% (144/695) in the normal care group (difference 1.9%, 95% confidence intervals -3.5% to 7.3%). babies born to women receiving the intervention were on average 84 g heavier than babies born to controls (p=0.04). serial ultrasound examinations indicated significantly greater growth in terms of estimated fetal weight, femur length and abdominal circumference in the contingent compared to the non-contingent conditions. smoking during pregnancy has been linked to health problems, including the risk of low birthweight, preterm labour, spontaneous abortion and perinatal death. it was found that the planned educational intervention was incompletely carried out and was given more effectively to primigravidae in whom subsequent reduction of smoking was more evident. there was a statistically significant difference in 30-day abstinence rates between si (26%) and uc (12%) conditions at the end of pregnancy among women who had not quit spontaneously with pregnancy (odds ratio [ however, significantly greater proportions of intervention group women reported either not smoking or reducing their cigarette consumption by 50% or more at their second visit (43% vs 29%, p = 0.02), at their 36th-week visit (40% vs 25%, p < 0.01), and at 1 year postpartum (26% vs 14%, p = 0.02). it was concluded that the intervention had either a small or no influence on cigarette smoking. an intervention of psychosocial support and health education during pregnancy failed to show any benefit on perinatal outcome, health-related behavior, or utilization of health facilities. fewer women in the intervention group reported smoking more (18 (5.1%) v 44 (10.7%); relative risk 0.48, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.81). the intervention failed to alter smoking but the intervention women did report more use of community resources (p = 0.02) and were less likely to skip meals (p = 0.03). no significant effect on smoking cessation or smoking reduction was obtained (p > 0.05). there was no difference in the rates of smoking cessation between the screened group and the control group. in a randomised controlled trial intensive individual anti-smoking advice given in parallel with hospital antenatal care did not influence the outcome of pregnancy. women in the cbt+nrt arm were almost three times more likely than women in the cbt-only arm to have biochemically validated cessation at both pregnancy time points (after 7 weeks: 24% vs 8%, p=0.02; at 38 weeks gestation: 18% vs 7%, p=0.04), but not at 3 months postpartum (20% vs 14%, p=0.55). black e and c group patients had higher quit rates than white e and c group patients. self-reported cessation rates during pregnancy were significantly higher in the intervention group (14%) than in the group receiving usual care (5.0%) (p < 0.0001) those receiving high feedback were more likely to report that they had acted on health advice given at the first antenatal visit to reduce their smoking and drinking. a significantly higher percentage of patients quit smoking in the experimental group (17.3%) than in the control group (8.8%). self-reported cigarette consumption fell significantly (p < 0.001) in the intervention group, with 16.2% giving up and 33.3% significantly reducing their cigarette consumption. there were no significant differences between the groups on change on any outcome. the intervention increased end-of-pregnancy cessation rates among 201 light smokers (< 10 cigarettes/day at study enrollment) (intervention 19.1% versus control 8.4%; or 2.58, 95% ci 1.1-6.1; number needed to treat = 9.3) and among 193 smokers who attempted to quit in pregnancy before enrollment (intervention 18.1% versus control 6.8%; or 3.02, ci 1.15-7.94; number needed to treat = 8.8); 63% of the sample (n = 267) was in one of these subgroups. a randomized trial evaluated the impact of smoking cessation interventions on point prevalence and consecutive quit rates at an australian public prenatal clinic. the experimental group received a stage of change-based, personalized feedback letter and two telephone counseling calls using motivational interviewing (mi) strategies. there was no difference in rates of full breast feeding between the control and intervention groups for women who planned to breast feed. mean birth weight difference was 186 g (95% ci 35, 336 g) higher in the nicotine than placebo group, and there was an insignificantly lower rate of low birth weight (under 2500 g) in the former group. there were no significant differences among the three groups for either the number who quit smoking or who reduced the number of cigarettes smoked. the midwife-assisted smoking cessation intervention seems to be an effective tool to help pregnant smokers make a decision to quit smoking. at the long-term follow-up, reported quitting rates were significantly greater among intervention group women cared for in the publicly supported clinic than among those receiving the usual care, 14.5% versus 2.5%, p < 0.01. biochemical confirmation of continuous abstinence through delivery revealed that 16% of the women in the experimental self-help program relapsed compared with 20% of usual care controls (ns). the intervention consisted of individual skills instruction and counseling by a peer health counselor on the use of a self-help cessation guide and routine clinic reinforcement. contingent vouchers increased 7-day point-prevalence abstinence at the end-of-pregnancy (37% vs. 9%) and 12-week postpartum (33% vs. 0%) assessments. compared to controls, smokers exposed to the intervention were more likely to have quit (14.5 versus 7.7%) or take actions toward quitting and had higher mean action, stage of readiness, and motivation to quit scores. 11% in the intervention group did not change their smoking habit and 4% increased their consumption compared to 36% and 22% respectively in the control group. results of this trial indicate that health education methods tailored to the pregnant smoker are more effective in changing smoking behavior than the standard clinic information and advice to quit and/or the use of smoking cessation methods not tailored to the needs of the pregnant smoker. this exploratory study examined the acceptability and efficacy of a videotape modeling smoking cessation as an adjunct to smoking cessation advice delivered during prenatal care. prevalent abstinence was significantly greater for the pre/post intervention group than for the other groups at 8 weeks (booklet group, 30%; prepartum group, 35%; pre/post group, 39%; p = .02 kruskal-wallis tests revealed significant differences at the second visit in the stage distributions by condition for subjects who were initially in precontemplation or in preparation. the smoking intervention programme led to a significant 66 g increase in mean birthweight (p = 0.03; 95% ci+9 to +123 g) and to a 30% reduction in the rate of low birthweight in pregnancies managed by the 70 physicians who secured the highest rate of obtaining repeat serum samples for cotinine measurements in their intervention group. this model for intervention was cost-effective and was associated with significantly lower smoking rates at end of pregnancy. after one year, the results showed quit rates of 9% in the treatment group and 0% in the control group. the tfsb group consistently achieved greater smoking cessation across all measures when compared to the subjects in the other two groups. nineteen percent of the experimental group reported 7-day abstinence compared to 7% of the control group at t1, and 21 and 12%, respectively, at t2. we conclude that a low-cost prenatal self-help intervention can significantly affect the public health problem of smoking during pregnancy and its associated risks for maternal and child health. the intervention and usual care groups differed in post-delivery point prevalence abstinence rates for recent ex-smokers (65% vs. 53%, p < 0.05, one-tailed), but not in other outcome measures. only one of the two women 'abstinent at delivery' was still abstinent 3 months after birth, the last contact point of the study. compared with usual care, peer counseling reduced smoking (-9.1 versus -4.5 cigarettes daily, p =.03), but did not affect absolute quit rates (24% versus 21%) at 36 weeks' gestation. tools have been developed to answer the question: 'can proactive opportunistic home-based motivational interviewing help pregnant smokers reduce their habit?'. midwives in these practices delivered three interventions: a (standard care), b (ttm based self help manuals), and c (ttm based self help manuals plus sessions with an interactive computer program giving individualised smoking cessation advice). at the eighth month of pregnancy, self-reported quitting was higher for intervention clinics than control clinics in all three states. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> study

smokers had increased two times greater in the control schools than in the intervention schools (boys: 20.5% points vs 9.4% points; girls: 44.3% points vs 21.0% points). plus significantly enhanced the effectiveness of the d.a.r.e. curriculum among boys and was more effective than the delayed program controls, underscoring the potential for multiyear, multicomponent prevention programs and demonstrating sex differences in response to intervention programs. preventing tobacco use in youths may be an easier task than helping adults break the habit of smoking and overcome its ill effects. blood pressure reduction was associated with decreased ponderosity and improved fitness, and increased hdl cholesterol was associated with decreased ponderosity. the analyses for nonsmokers, however, showed no significant effects, and the program did not affect self-reported alcohol or marijuana use. students in the school health intervention program had statistically significant positive effects regarding knowledge level, attitudes, and the development of refusal, decision-making, and problem-solving skills. support was found for the intervention's overall effectiveness, with statistically significant effects on gateway drug use as well as norms, attitudes, and resistance strategies but with little support for the cultural matching hypothesis. relative to randomized matched controls, adolescents whose parents engaged in the family check-up exhibited less growth in alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use and problem behavior during ages 11 through 17, along with decreased risk for substance use diagnoses and police records of arrests by age 18. there were no significant differences among grade 10 smoking rates for females, or for students of either gender with previous smoking experience in grade 8. however, the refusal skills training, which was carried out throughout the 3-year intervention period, produced significant differences in overall refusal skill quality only at the seventh grade. both smoked and smokeless tobacco use rates increased in all groups, and youths in the skills intervention group consistently showed the lowest rates relative to the other groups. process evaluations revealed that the project's ambitions were high, but were limited by various constraints including time and delays in receiving funds. one year after the program was concluded, the proportion of non-smokers was higher among those who had participated in the program than among the controls. project sport participants demonstrated significant positive effects at 3-months postintervention for alcohol consumption, alcohol initiation behaviors, alcohol use risk and protective factors, drug use behaviors, and exercise habits, and at 12-months for alcohol use risk and protective factors, cigarette use, and cigarette initiation (p's < 0.05). across all program schools, the two different curricula failed to significantly reduce dichotomous measures of substance use (cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and hard drugs) at one-year follow-up. both teacher-led and older peer-led interventions were successful in increasing behavioral capabilities for nutrition and blood pressure, measured one year after the interventions. to test whether a social network tailored substance abuse prevention program can reduce substance use among high-risk adolescents without creating deviancy training (iatrogenic effects). the most successful program was the si program with boosters which resulted in a significantly lower increase in smoking rates (5.6 and 9.7%, respectively) compared to the control group (12.6 and 14.9%, respectively) at both 12 and 18 months follow-up. using hierarchical linear modeling, we found that students in the control schools reported significantly less use of illegal drugs excluding marijuana than those in the intervention group at the first posttest; however, this effect did not persist one year later. smoking rates at posttest and at both follow-ups were lower in the skills-building group than in the other three groups. after one year of intervention, the program was found to be acceptable to school administrators, teachers, parents, and children. the rate of attempting smoking decreased form 7.8% to 2.6% and the rate of passive smoking from 53.6% to 41.8%. at posttest and a 6-month follow-up, american-indian subjects who received preventive intervention based on bicultural competence skills concepts improved more than did american-indian subjects in a no-intervention control condition on measures of substance-use knowledge, attitudes, and interactive skills, and on self-reported rates of tobacco, alcohol, and drug use. there were two experimental conditions: one group participated in a school-based intervention and were prompted to participate in a multi-media intervention and the other group had access to the multi-media intervention; however, they were not prompted to participate. results revealed a marked suppression in the onset of both experimental and regular smoking among those students exposed to the pressure resistance training with peer leader involvement. the school-based adolescent harm minimization intervention appears to have been more effective than the abstinence-based social influences programme at reducing regular smoking. short-term effectiveness of the program was found for the children's knowledge of physiology of the heart and smoking. results indicated that the prevention program was able to reduce new cigarette smoking by 50% at the end of the first year and by 55% at the end of the second year for the intensive format condition. the program was successful in improving smoking knowledge, but not attitudes, in intervention versus control group (p < 0.001). the classroom-centered (cc) intervention was designed to reduce the risk for tobacco smoking by enhancing teachers' behavior management skills in first grade and, thereby, reducing child attention problems and aggressive and shy behavior-known risk behaviors for later substance use. although prevalence decreased in intervention schools and increased in control schools in year 2 the significant difference between the two groups at baseline was not overcome by the intervention and increases in prevalence were observed in both groups in years 3 and 4. no significant difference in prevalence of daily smoking was found between students in the control and experimental districts, either at grade 12 (difference [delta] = 0.2%, 95% confidence interval [ci] = mediational analyses showed that prevention effects on some drug use outcomes were mediated in part by risk-taking, behavioral intentions, and peer normative expectations regarding drug use. self-control skills subjects had better 15-month follow-up scores than subjects in the other two conditions on measures of communication, self-instruction, self-praise, cigarette refusals, and noncompliance to smoke. differences between groups in self-efficacy and resistance skills were not significant. social pressure associated with starting to smoke (friends, sibsters, parents smokers) measured before intervention had no demonstrable influence on efficacy. in girls, both the teacher-led and peer-led programmes maintained their effects over the two years of follow-up with adjusted differences in prevalence rates of the uptake of smoking relative to the control group of -6.6% (95% cl, -17.3%, 4.0%) and -8.1% (95% cl, -18.9%, 2.7%), respectively, after two years. there were no consistent program effects on refusal/self-efficacy, smoking intentions, or behavior. the amount of program exposure was low in many classes, but program use displayed a dose-response relationship with reduced smoking prevalence. students in the program condition experienced a greater reduction in weekly smoking and monthly smoking, at 6-and-12-month follow-ups. significant program effects were documented, most clearly for those having some experience with smoking before the program began and for those with smoking peer and family models. the program did have an effect on the refusal skills of participants and the validity of this effect was not jeopardized by differential attrition. the intention to treat odds ratio for smoking in the intervention group relative to control was 1.08 four different school-based tobacco use prevention curricula were developed to counteract the effects of three types of tobacco use acquisition variables typically addressed within a comprehensive social influences program: (1) peer approval for using tobacco (normative social influence), (2) incorrect social informational provided about tobacco use (information social influence) and (3) lack of knowledge or misperceptions about physical consequences resulting from tobacco use. knowledge about effects of smoking rose in all groups from a mean score of 5.4 in 1988 to 6.4 in 1989 and 6.5 in 1990. program effects were found for daily cigarette smoking (por=0.70; 0.52-0.94) and episodes of drunkenness in the past 30 days (por=0.72; 0.58-0.90 for at least one episode, por=0.69; 0.48-0.99 for three or more episodes), while effects on cannabis use in the past 30 days were of marginal statistical significance (por=0.77; 0.60-1.00). repeated measures analysis of variance resulted in significant treatment by occasion interactions on the use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, cocaine, and other drugs, as well as on knowledge. the impact of yat is consistent with experimental and nonexperimental evaluations of media campaigns to influence young people not to smoke. this adaptation of mi was not demonstrated to be effective in either intention-to-treat or sub-group analyses for any outcome. improvements to social competence reduced multiple drug use at 1- and 2-year follow-ups. inadequate implementation of the programme by some teachers may have been associated with adverse effects on the children's behaviour, attitudes and knowledge. moreover, the prevention program is also capable of producing a significant impact on several hypothesized mediating variables. a school-based drug abuse prevention approach previously found to be effective among white youth significantly reduced smoking initiation and escalation among urban minority girls. we conclude that this peer pressure resistance skill program was effective in preventing experimentation with tobacco among sixth graders in tijuana, mexico. the girls in the group also evidenced lower rates of substance use initiation, while the boys exhibited increased social and school work skills. at 24-month follow-up, youths who received health information and skills intervention had lower intentions to smoke and less cigarette use than youths who received health information alone and youths who received no intervention. there were no differences in the effects of the two program conditions. among boys who were recent smokers at baseline, the prevention program significantly reduced risk of remaining recent smokers at follow-up (or=0.45 with 95% ci=0.23, 0.88). the community programme had significant effects on the prevalence of weekly cigarette use at times 2 and 5 and the effect approached significance at time 4. subgroup analyses indicated that the negative effect occurred among nonusers at baseline, and mostly among white students of both genders. further, in both classes, more rapid increases in smoking were observed for the control group as compared to the intervention group (or=1.22, p<0.01 slow escalators; or=1.54, p=0.08 rapid/moderate escalators). a pilot project for the prevention of substance abuse in schools (pase) has been developed in 1988-90 in sixth and seventh grades (12-14 years-old) in 11 primary schools in the city of barcelona (spain). the "smoke-free class competition" did not prevent smoking among adolescents and does not appear to be an effective substitute to the complete ban of tobacco advertising, the abolition of vending machines and the creation of smoke-free environments in german schools. no significant effects emerged for at-risk boys or at-risk adolescents in schools where the basic alert curriculum (covering seventh and eighth grades only) was delivered. there were main effects of normative education for summary measures of alcohol (p = 0.0011), marijuana (p = 0.0096), and cigarette smoking (p = 0.0311). the programme embraced the social influence approach and concentrated on enhancing self-efficacy and the acquisition of cigarette refusal skills. results indicated significant (p < .05) intervention effects in growth trajectories for frequency of alcohol and marijuana use but not for use versus nonuse. there were significantly fewer new "smokers" in the experimental school than in the control school at both the initial posttest (p less than .01) and the three-month followup (p less than .05) along with significantly greater changes on some of the knowledge and personality variables. twelve months after the pre-test (post-test 2), the in-school intervention was successful in preventing vocational school students from continuing to smoke, compared with students in the control condition [odds ratio (or) = 0.49; 95% confidence interval (ci) = 0.29-0.84]. results from a longitudinal evaluation of the program in 36 schools in illinois provide only limited support for dare's impact on student's drug use immediately following the intervention, and no support for either continued or emerging impact on drug use 1 or 2 years after receiving dare instruction. school-based drug prevention programs can prevent occasional and more serious drug use, help low- to high-risk adolescents, and be effective in diverse school environments. a total of 8549 children aged 9-10 were allocated to the intervention group and 8897 to the control group. first-time consumers of drugs like cannabis, marihuana and organic solvents were found less often in the intervention group among boys in high schools than in the control group (i: 14.9%; k: 23.6%; p < 0.05). both the peer-led and teacher-led interventions had positive, though not significant, effects on student perception of locus of control. at baseline, students in the intervention condition were slightly to moderately more likely to report use for each of the 8 measures examined than were students in the control condition. at the end of 3 years, students in the intervention school districts report less onset and prevalence of alcohol use than students in the reference districts. the odds ratio of being a smoker in intervention compared with control schools was 0.75 (95% ci 0.55-1.01) immediately after the intervention (n=9349 students), 0.77 (0.59-0.99) at 1-year follow-up (n=9147), and 0.85 (0.72-1.01) at 2-year follow-up (n=8756). the prospective study indicated that none of the interventions was more effective in reducing adolescent tobacco use compared with a randomized control group. there were no differences between the two control conditions and the self-efficacy condition. significant net changes in the favorable direction also were observed for total cholesterol/hdl cholesterol ratio and for thiocyanate. in general, such programmes have been shown to be less effective than one might expect, and much remains to be learned about the types of educational experiences that are effective in preventing adolescents from becoming habitual smokers. smoking initiation was reduced in both cohorts for boys assigned to the behavioral intervention. intervention and control groups were comparable in terms of tobacco use, gender, ethnicity, behavioral, environmental, and psychosocial characteristics. after 2 years of treatment, smoking rates in the treatment group (vs the control group) were lower for 30-day, 7-day, and 24-hour smoking. relative reduction rates for alcohol initiation were 30.0% for the combined intervention and 4.1% for lst only. prevention effects were also found for normative expectations and knowledge concerning substance use, interpersonal skills, and communication skills. the 5th grade kir curriculum generally appeared no more effective than the control schools' programming in changing students' resistance or decision-making skills; substance use intentions, expectancies, or normative beliefs; or lifetime and recent substance use. the two pedagogical methods that were used in the present study influenced the young people's attitudes towards tobacco use only to a small extent. in the short-term, an intervention based on peer pressure decreases the proportion of adolescents with lower education who start smoking. at follow-up the proportion of smokers had increased by 8.3 percentage points in group a (control) and by 1.9 percentage points in group b (most extensive intervention). the smoking zine intervention provided cessation motivation for smokers most resistant to quitting at baseline and prevented nonsmoking adolescents from becoming heavy smokers at 6 months. there were no significant differences in outcome as a function of training method and no significant differences in outcome between teacher-provided and nurse-provided interventions in high- and medium-risk schools. no significant differences were observed between intervention and comparison schools with respect to cigarette, alcohol, or marijuana use during the 7th grade, approximately 1 year after completion of the program, or over the full 5-year measurement interval. findings showed that students in the intervention group were significantly less likely than were students in the control group to exhibit increases in cigarette smoking or bidi smoking over the 2-year study period. analyses failed to yield any positive effects for substance use or mediators for use in the adult or teen-assisted delivery of the curriculum. community intervention components appeared to exert no added beneficial influence on youths' substance use, beyond the impact of skills intervention components alone. it is concluded that brief family skills-training interventions designed for general populations have the potential to reduce adolescent substance use and thus have important public health implications. this evaluation suggests that the program has some utility in preventing the uptake of tobacco use among young males; however, its efficacy with females has been negligible. hispanic boys who received the multicultural curriculum were less likely to initiate smoking than were those who received the standard curriculum; effects were insignificant among other groups. intervention students were significantly less likely than controls to have been offered, received, experimented with, or have intentions to use tobacco. post-test analyses indicated that the social program delivered to seventh grade subjects was effective in delaying the onset of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana use. the mean knowledge scores from baseline to the 1- and 2-year follow-ups increased more in the intervention group than in the control group, whereas there was little change in attitude scores. for alcohol use, no effect of intervention during childhood was found. latent growth curve analyses demonstrated significant treatment group effects, including reducing increases in friends who smoke, outcome expectations for smoking, and smoking progression, but had non-significant effects on drinking or antisocial behavior. the intervention group had a higher intention not to smoke (β=0.13, 95% confidence interval=0.01-0.24) and started to smoke less often than the control group (odds ratio=0.59, 95% confidence interval=0.35-0.99): smoking increased from 2.5% to 3.6% in the intervention group and from 3.2% to 6.5% in the control group. baseline binge drinkers in sfa schools were less likely to report recent binge drinking than students in control schools (p<.01); there were no treatment differences among baseline nonbinge drinkers. community team functioning (e.g., production of quality team promotional materials) and technical assistance (ta) variables (e.g., effective collaboration with ta, frequency of ta requests) were associated with higher recruitment rates, even after controlling for community and school district contextual influences. the two experimental curricula both produced similar overall reductions in smoking prevalence that were not significantly different from each other or the control group. <INPUT_END>

(2) higher percentage of blocks moved by the impaired hand; (3) faster motor reaction time (peripheral component), and (4) faster total reaction time. both groups performed unimanual tasks faster than bimanual and stroke participants were only slightly less synchronised when performing bimanual tasks. this robust analysis revealed higher emg activation levels for the coupled bilateral movement/stimulation group than the unilateral movement/stimulation group. this work was designed to study the effects of bilateral elbow flexion on the reaction and movement times of the impaired upper extremity of patients with hemiparesis. patients with moderate upper extremity motor impairment performed more discontinuous movements and less active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks; however, those with mild upper extremity motor impairment performed smoother movements and demonstrated greater active elbow range of motion during bilateral reaching tasks. the bat group showed a significantly greater improvement in the fma than the control group but not in the fim and mal. enhanced performance was found for the distributed cit group in the mal, the subtest of locomotion in the fim, and certain domains of the sis (eg, adl/iadl). changes in activation were observed in the contralesional cerebrum and ipsilesional cerebellum (p = .009). significant findings for the (1) number of blocks moved in a functional task, (2) chronometric reaction times to initiate movements, and (3) sustained muscle contraction capability all favored the coupled bilateral movement training and emg-triggered neuromuscular stimulation protocol group. small increases in muscle activity were demonstrated by both experimental and control subjects during most bilateral practices in both actions. whether patients practised with the affected arm or simultaneously with both the affected and non-affected arm only marginally modified outcome, unilateral training being slightly more efficacious. individuals receiving bilateral training showed a reduction in movement time of the impaired limb and increased upper limb functional ability compared to individuals receiving unilateral training. baseline severity significantly influenced improvement in all upper-limb outcomes (p<.05), but this was irrespective of the treatment group. the bilateral group had significantly greater improvement on the upper arm function scale (a subscale of the mas-upper limb items). nonparetic peak acceleration was higher (p=.015), velocity was unchanged, and movement time increased (p=.005) in the bilateral compared with the unilateral task. combined unilateral and bilateral training yielded functional gains that were similar to the gains from equivalent doses of unilateral-only robotic training, although the combined group had more hypertonia and less movement out of synergy at baseline. during the posttest, the coupled bilateral group displayed improved movement time, higher peak limb velocity, less variability in peak velocity, and less percentage of total movement time in the deceleration phase than during the pretest. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> early poststroke rehabilitation 21 patients (median [iqr], 50.3 [34.8-77.3] months after unilateral stroke chronic stroke survivors with moderate upper extremity impairment twenty unilateral stroke patients were recruited thirteen stroke survivors aged 55 - 77 years and 13 healthy, neurologically intact participants aged 57 - 86 years performed a unimanual and two bimanual tasks involving the relocation of single and paired objects patients with chronic stroke. chronic cerebrovascular accident individuals with partial paralysis 33 stroke patients (mean age = 53.85 years) 6 to 67 months after onset of a first stroke patients with hemiparesis for unilateral and bilateral elbow flexion twenty subjects 14 almost completely recovered hemiparetic stroke patients and 14 healthy control subjects individuals receiving twenty-five cva subjects volunteered to participate in this motor recovery protocol study chronic stroke twenty-six volunteers completed one of three motor recovery protocols according to group assignments: (1 patients with hemiparetic stroke subjects with mild to moderate chronic hemiparesis patients with hemiparesis sixteen chronic stroke subjects subjects with acute and chronic problems with one and two bilateral practice phases patients with hemiparesis (n = 25) and a control group of age-matched healthy volunteers (n = 26 thirty-two subjects with chronic stroke (57+/-14y;

p < 0.05) and cocaine-positive urine samples (52.6% versus 62.4% and 67.1% for the 20- and 0-mg groups, respectively; p < 0.05). relative efficacy was evaluated by illicit drug use, program retention and attendance, and global staff judgments. methadone reduction treatment processes were associated with poor outcomes, and many patients who were allocated to methadone reduction treatment did not receive reduction treatment as intended. the influence of program orientation on retention was greater the higher the maximum dose of methadone. in 370 opioid-dependent patients included consecutively in a low-threshold methadone maintenance program, the effect of different variables on the retention rate was assessed. patients assigned to high-dose methadone maintenance performed significantly better on measures of retention, opioid use, and opioid craving than either the low-dose methadone or the buprenorphine group at both 26-week and 52-week time points. patients taking > or = 60 mg/day and 30-59 mg/day were respectively 70 and 50% more likely to remain in treatment than those receiving a < 30 mg daily dose. dose was not related to the likelihood of a positive morphine test but was related to the likelihood of a positive cocaine test. the estimated median time in maintenance for subjects given a maximum dose of 120 mg was 1150 days while for 80 mg it was 660 days. the more 'humane' clinic policy later in the decade is likely to have increased retention and reduced illicit drug use also. through day 210 no significant difference was evident between dose groups in treatment retention (high-dose group mean retention, 159 days; moderate-dose group mean retention, 157 days). for the entire 25 weeks, retention rates for buprenorphine (30%, p less than .01) and methadone, 60 mg/ rates of abstinence from illicit opioids were significantly higher for females, within the buprenorphine 4-mg group, females also had significantly better retention, lower rates of opioid-positive urine samples, and higher rates of abstinence from illicit opioids. contingent vouchers and a methadone dose increase each significantly increased the percentage of opiate-negative urine specimens during intervention. dropouts were more likely among patients who enrolled in the first (rh 6.2, 95% ci 2.3-16.7) and second (rh 1.9, 95% ci 0.6-5.6) years of the programme, compared with subsequent years (rh 1.0). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 229 hiv-negative clients who received methadone between january 1981 and june 1991 610 opioid users admitted to methadone maintenance and followed for 1 year patient retention in a newly established methadone maintenance treatment programme maintained patients 430 street heroin addicts from 12 veterans administration hospitals 142 patients receiving eighty male and 36 female patients 370 opioid-dependent patients included consecutively in a low-threshold methadone maintenance program 146 patients receiving 498 dutch injecting drug users (idu) provided 1,969 person years of follow-up (1989-1995 one hundred ninety-two eligible clinic patients low-threshold maintenance programs two hundred and eighty patients recently enrolled in single-person, private methadone programs were interviewed and followed for 8 years all patients who initiated treatment between february 1991 and january 1995 40 to 50 mg (n = 97) or 80 to 100 mg (n = 95), with concurrent substance abuse counseling participants (n = 247) were opioid-dependent patients with a high rate of cocaine use 111 patients contributed 164.4 person-years of follow-up patients who have a long history of drug use and who have a stable income were more likely to stay in methadone maintenance treatment 229 hiv-negative clients and also from the 40 clients known to be infected with hiv during the decade patients enrolled in a methadone-maintainence program who continued to use heroin, abstinence reinforcement and a outpatient substance abuse treatment research clinic at the johns hopkins university bayview campus, baltimore, md heroin addicts patients' age, sex, family situation, employment status, length of heroin use, current route of drug consumption, previous treatments, current consumption of cocaine, alcohol and benzodiazepines, needle sharing, hiv serostatus and methadone dose opioid dependence 1503 heroin users attending public treatment centres in 1995 was studied 307 heroin addicts admitted into a high-dose, australian methadone maintenance programme in the early 1970s two hundred twenty-five treatment-seeking opioid addicts (46 women, 179 men one hundred sixty-two volunteers seeking treatment for opioid dependence heroin users in italy june 1992 and ending in october 1995 <INPUT_END>

<INPUT_END>  <punchline_text>￨<INPUT_START> there was no difference of side effects between the two groups. mifepristone and oral misoprostol are typically used for medical abortion in women up to 49 days of gestation, with a 36- to 48-hour interval between the medications. the time elapsed between ru 486 intake and expulsion of the conceptus was significantly shorter in the ru 486+pg group (n = 97, 31 days) than that in the ru 486 alone group (n = 95, 4.4 4.4 days). complete abortion rates for groups 1 and 2 were 503 of 525 (95.8%, 95% confidence interval 93.7%, 97.3%) and 521 of 531 (98.1%, 95% confidence interval 96.6%, 99.1%), respectively, which were statistically equivalent. there was no difference in efficacy or side effects whether the prostaglandin was administered 24 or 48 hours after mifepristone intake, which suggests that the treatment period can be reduced from the conventional 48 hours. vaginal bleeding followed by complete abortion occurred in 18 of 19 women who received ru486 + 1 mg pg pessary as compared to only 12 of 20 women who received ru486 alone (p less than 0.01). five of the seven regimens resulted in complete abortion rates of 60% or less. nausea, vomiting or diarrhoea in women using the standard regimen (group 2) occurred in 68%, 36%, and 20%, respectively. surgical intervention was indicated for continuing pregnancy at the second follow-up visit, excessive bleeding, or persistent products of conception 5 weeks later. efficacy and adverse effects did not differ significantly across the three study groups. intramuscular methotrexate followed by vaginal misoprostol has been shown to be effective for abortion at < or = 49 days gestation. side effects occurred with similar frequency in both treatment groups. oral administration of misoprostol was associated with a higher frequency of nausea and vomiting than vaginal administration at 1 hour after administration. in phase 1, the success rate was higher in the methotrexate group (93.0%) compared to the tamoxifen group (85.7%) (p = 0.045). the incidence of diarrhoea in pg05 group (38.7%) was significantly higher than that in the other two groups (21.6 and 20.1%) (p < 0.001), and so was vomiting. women receiving misoprostol sublingually were more likely to experience diarrhoea (p < 0.01), shivering (p < 0.01) and unpleasant mouth taste (p < 0.01). repeat administration of misoprostol or surgical treatment was required in 23 women (11%) in the 6-hour group and 8 women (4%) in the 36- to 48-hour group. the incidence of diarrhoea was significantly higher (66, 55.1 and 12.5% respectively) in the groups with oral misoprostol after abortion. cramping and nausea were the most common adverse effects reported, with similar percentages of patients in all 3 groups reporting such effects. women with complete abortions had significantly lower pretreatment levels of progesterone and a longer duration of induced bleeding than those who did not abort. cortisol (at 12 and 36 hours after mifepristone) and prolactin (at 12 hours) were significantly higher in the single 600-mg dose group. there were few gastro-intestinal side effects following prostaglandin. success rates in the oral and buccal groups were 91.3% (389 of 426) and 96.2% (405 of 421), respectively (p=.003; relative risk [rr] 0.95, 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.92-0.98). only three of the six women with treatment failure still had detectable fetal heart activity when the pregnancy was terminated by vacuum aspiration two weeks after the start of treatment. fever, chills and gastrointestinal side-effects (nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea) were significantly more common in the sublingual group. while an additional oral dose of 400 microgram misoprostol did not significantly increase the rate of complete abortion without surgical intervention, the additional dose did significantly reduce the rate of continuing pregnancies without compromising the acceptability and ease of use of the method. the efficacy of the mifepristone-prostaglandin regimen was not reduced by decreasing the dose of mifepristone from 600 mg to 200 mg. there were no differences in either group between earlier (</=49 days) and later (50-56 days) gestations. in each treatment group, women who subsequently aborted completely had significantly lower pretreatment levels of hcg than women with incomplete abortion or continuing pregnancy. the complete abortion rate in group 3 was significantly higher than that of both group 1 and group 2 (p < 0.05). overall acceptability and route acceptability were similar in the two groups. nausea was the most commonly reported side effect, affecting 70% in the buccal group and 62% in the vaginal group. there were no differences in rates of success, side effects, or acceptability between groups receiving oral and injected methotrexate. equivalence was also evident for the two intervals of administration: the rate of complete abortion was 93.5% for 24-hour interval and 91.7% for the 48-hour interval (difference -1.8%, 95% ci: -4.0 to 0.5). complete abortion occurred in 98.7% of the sublingual group and 94.0% of the oral group (p value=.006, rr: 1.05, 95% ci=1.01--1.09). methotrexate levels peaked within 1 to 2 hours and were nondetectable within 48 hours in all patients in group 1 and 72 hours in group 2. for amenorrhoea length > or =57 days, vaginal misoprostol is more effective than oral when continued with 0.4 mg oral misoprostol twice daily for seven days. however, the complete abortion rate was significantly higher in women < or = 49 days compared to women 50-63 days amenorrhoea (97.5 versus 89.1% respectively; p < 0.02). the rate of complete abortion was very high (>95%) in both groups but significantly higher after treatment with misoprostol than with gemeprost [436/453 (98.7%) versus 451/457 (96.2%), p = 0.019, difference 2.5%, confidence interval 0.4-4.7%] and there were fewer ongoing pregnancies (n = 1 versus n = 8, p < 0.018). complete abortion occurred in 28 (90%) of 31 patients in group 1 and 14 (47%) of 30 patients in group 2 (p < .001). treatment failures in group 1 were four continuing pregnancies (9%), two incomplete abortions (4%), and two women who requested surgical termination after receiving both medications (4%). the incidence of side-effects, such as vomiting, nausea, headache, diarrhea and lower abdominal pain was similar in the two groups. vomiting and diarrhea were reported more frequently by the women who received oral misoprostol than by those who received vaginal misoprostol (p = 0.04 and p = 0.002, respectively). the relative risk of failure to have a complete abortion with the lower dose of mifepristone was 1.6 (95% ci: 1.1-2.3) times that with the higher dose. the incidence of diarrhoea was significantly lower for women receiving the sequential dose, and no significant differences were found in the incidence of the other gastrointestinal side effects. no significant statistical differences were found in the success rates when misoprostol was given days 3, 4, or 5 after the administration of methotrexate (p = 0.69). complete abortion rates at 2-week follow-up were recorded for 431 (84%) in the sublingual and for 434 (85%) women in the vaginal group when misoprostol was given at 3-h intervals (difference 0.4%, 95% ci -4.0 to 4.9, p=0.85 equivalence shown), and for 399 (78%) in the sublingual and for 425 (83%) in the vaginal 12-h groups (4.6%, -0.2 to 9.5, p=0.06, equivalence not shown). there was no significant difference in the rate of complete abortion between group a regimen of mifepristone and misoprostol was significantly more effective for termination of pregnancies < or = 56 days than misoprostol alone. <INPUT_END>

women who performed special breast cleansing before breast pumping had significantly lower bacterial colony counts in their cultured breast milks. the tukey revealed significant differences (p < 0.01) between electric breast pump expression and hand expression but not between the electric and pedal pump or the pedal pump and hand expression. milk extraction efficiency was greater (p = 0.001) with the standard pump. the two groups did not differ on several demographic characteristics, stai scores, prolactin levels, number of pumping sessions per week, or weekly milk production. mothers who used the ep, who frequently double pumped, showed shorter expression times but produced no more milk than mothers who used the mp. when breast milk was expressed at home, the rates of bacterial contamination by staphylococci (p= 0.003) and gram-negative bacilli (p= 0.002) were significantly higher in the breast-pump group than the manual group. when analyses were adjusted for this, there was no difference in bibs 1 between targeted and usual care groups and in bibs 2 among the treatment groups in the proportion of women still breastfeeding at the times studied. milk yield per expression was: sequential pumping with no massage, mother's knowledge significantly increased for the intervention group but not the control group (p = 0.041). the mp was rated significantly better overall and more comfortable and pleasant to use. the fat content of the breast milk in the two groups was not significantly different. this difference did not reach statistical significance. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> wic women returning to work or school in hawaii lactating women mothers of very low birthweight infants mothers of premature or sick infants in special care nurseries (scn premature infants with a relaxation/imagery audiotape 228 ml (n = 22), 463 breast-feeding mothers egyptian mothers of preterm infants all 100 mothers initiated lactation with the cbp mothers who delivered preterm infants enrolled obese women who intended to breastfeed in two randomized trials 36 women were analysed;

least as effective as propranolol (p<0.001 in one-sided test). in both groups no severe side effects were observed. a statistically significant reduction in the frequency of the attacks was demonstrated in both groups. both drugs were generally well tolerated and the number of reported side-effects was similar to those reported during the run-in period (placebo). all three groups reported improvement, the most noticeable being in those patients who received 80 mg of nadolol daily. the treatment with both substances resulted in a statistically significant reduction in frequency of migraine attacks. headache index 0.95 propranolol and 23 patients on placebo experienced side effects (p less than 0.05). based on arima statistics, 39.3% of the patients showed a significant improvement of migraine during treatment with cyclandelate compared with 29.4% placed on propranolol. both treatments led to a significant reduction in the frequency of migraines and use of rescue analgesics with a significantly greater decrease in number of attacks for flunarizine after 1 and 4 months. concerning the frequency and intensity of attacks, additional analgesics consumption and overall evaluation, both drugs proved to be highly effective in the practice as well as in the hospital study. there was no significant difference between the two groups in terms of patient profile, onset of response to therapy, final response to therapy, incidence of dropout from the trial or incidence of side-effects. compared to the pretreatment period, prp and asa reduced migraine index, frequency, duration, severity of attacks and headache days. statistical analysis did not show any significant difference between the two drugs in respect to headache or nausea. it is concluded from the results that there are no differences in efficacy between metoprolol and propranolol regarding the studied parameters. the effectiveness of neither drug correlated with a decrease in anxiety or depression demonstrated by psychological testing. in the 37 patients who completed the trial there was no significant difference between propranolol 160 mg and femoxetine 400 mg with respect to the number of headache days or the number of migraine attacks during the last 2 months of each treatment, propranolol, however, was superior to femoxetine when the headache index was used ( adverse experiences were reported by 13 patients (16.0%) treated with cyclandelate, by 5 patients (9.1%) treated with placebo and by 19 patients (24.4%) treated with propranolol. these side effects led 45% (9/20) of the nifedipine patients to withdraw from the study within two weeks. there were no significant effects of mefenamic acid or propranolol on average duration or severity of migraine attacks. there were no significant differences between the three treatment periods in headache frequency, headache severity, nausea frequency or severity. at baseline, migraine patients had significantly higher vep amplitudes and longer latencies than did a group of 87 healthy control subjects. no significant difference was identified between divalproex and propranolol for the prophylaxis of migraine without aura. no statistical significant difference in any efficacy parameter was found between the two drugs (level 2 alpha = 0.05, alpha = 0.10). among 24 fully assessable sets of tests only four showed a decrease in the frequency of headaches by more than 50%. both tolfenamic acid and propranolol significantly reduced the number of attacks, the total duration of attacks and additional drugs taken when compared with placebo. inderal seemed to be more effective than d-propranolol, but the difference was not statistically significant (p greater than 0.05). both drugs showed a significant reduction in all the efficacy variables (headache attacks, days with headache, analgesic consumption) with no difference between treatments. la.p was significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of migraine attacks (p = 0.01 by variance analysis). chronic treatments of methysergide and propranolol, drugs exerting antagonist action at 5-ht receptors, induced a significant amelioration in 256m sufferers. after propranolol treatment, the patients showed lower adp threshold values for producing irreversible platelet aggregation and lower platelet and plasma camp levels as compared to metoprolol. a statistically significant difference in effect could not be ascertained. two and 4 months after treatment withdrawal, most subjects with a negative response to the post-treatment test maintained treatment benefit, whereas benefit was lost in patients with an early onset migraine response. it was not found statistical differences between groups, nevertheless there was a trend in the group using two drugs reaching lower values in migraine index, frequency of attacks and global evaluation. a significant reduction in the use of medication relieving attacks was observed during the propranolol treatment as compared with the pre-treatment period. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 58 patients with common or classical migraine thirty-six patients with

found regarding age, sex, number of previous episodes and duration of the recent episode and outcome. patients also demonstrated similar change-over-time improvement in ham-d-17 and ham-d-anxiety madrs responders were 58% and 56% with tianeptine and fluoxetine, respectively (p = 0.710). the total score on the hamilton rating scale for depression and the global improvement score on the clinical global impressions scale favored trazodone at the end of 3 weeks of treatment. regardless of how strict the definition of response, we found fluoxetine to be as effective as doxepin in our group of melancholic outpatients. a final hamilton depression rating scale (ham-d) score < 7 was attained in 41% of venlafaxine-treated and 36% of fluoxetine-treated patients. discontinuations for adverse events were comparable (fluoxetine, 21.4%; imipramine, 22.6%). patients taking fluoxetine reported less side-effects than those taking amitriptyline. duloxetine was superior to placebo in change on the ham-d-17 (p = .009). both patient groups had significantly lower mean scores on the hamilton depression rating scale (hdrs) 6 weeks after entry to the trial (p < 0.001), but there were no differences between the groups, either at baseline or after 6 weeks, in total hrds score or in subscores for anxiety or suicidality. a significantly greater proportion of patients treated with either reboxetine or fluoxetine also achieved a response ( between groups, the mean score of hamilton rating scale for depression (hrsd) was significantly different only after 3 weeks of treatment (am 14.7+/-5.7 vs fx 17.3+/-6.2 (p = 0.02), whereas at the end of the trial it was similar (am 8.15+/-6.9; fx 8.96+/-6.6). both venlafaxine and fluoxetine produced significant reductions from baseline to day 56 in mean ham-d, madrs, and cgi-s scores, but no significant differences were noted between groups. primary outcome measurements included the 21-item hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d) and the clinical global impressions-improvement scale (cgi-i), with scores of < or = 7 on the ham-d and < or = 2 on the cgi there were no statistically significant differences in rates or mean numbers of adverse events between paroxetine-treated patients and fluoxetine-treated patients. side effects were not predictive of being adherent or not, but a higher initial ham-d score predicted a higher adherence to the medication regimen. intragroup analysis showed that amineptine was significantly superior to fluoxetine on the retardation pole of the mood, anxiety, retardation, danger scale. efficacy was measured by the hamilton depression rating scale, the clinical global impression (severity and improvement) scales, and the patient global impression (improvement) scale. there were no significant differences in secondary efficacy outcome measures, but more patients achieved a > or = 50% decrease in hdrs score on moclobemide (71% vs 38%, p < 0.05). both agents were effective according to weekly and endpoint analyses, and there was no evidence of significant effects on blood pressure, pulse, or weight. patients taking fluoxetine also showed significant improvements at endpoint on the madrs and earlier in the study on the ham-d. no new or unusual safety concerns were generated during this study. in sleep eeg measures, trimipramine demonstrated clear-cut effects on sleep measures resulting in higher values for sleep efficiency, total sleep time, stage 2 sleep, and shorter wake time. a double-blind clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate clinical efficacy and safety of fluoxetine in comparison with the standard tricyclic antidepressant, imipramine, in the treatment of depressive illness. the success rate at the end of the treatment (madrs < or = 10) was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group (fluoxetine group: 48.4% vs tianeptine group: 28.1%) (p = 0.005). important differences were found in the side-effects profile of each group, their incidence being significantly lower and tending to disappear during the course of treatment in the group of patients treated with fluoxetine. at study endpoint, both treatments produced a significant improvement over baseline on all efficacy variables (p < 0.001). fluoxetine produced greater improvement than placebo on all major efficacy parameters and was comparable to imipramine with respect to the primary indicators of depression. both drugs produced a similarly positive response on the primary efficacy measures, with 12-week responder rates of 73% for sertraline and 71% for fluoxetine. the impact of both drugs on sleep measured using the leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire showed no significant differences between treatments, however drowsiness and disturbed sleep were reported more frequently as side effects with dothiepin. no differences in efficacy were observed, but the profile of side-effects differed with tremor, rash, nausea and headache occurring with fluoxetine, and drowsiness, dizziness and visual disturbance with dothiepin. nefazodone was associated with normal objective, and clinician- and patient-rated assessments of sleep when compared with fluoxetine. the most frequently reported side effects were nausea and nervousness for fluoxetine, and dry mouth, dizziness, and drowsiness for amitriptyline. as measured by ham-d and cgi-severity scores, there was a significant (p < .001) improvement from baseline to each follow-up visit in both treatment groups with no statistically significant difference between groups. amitriptyline 150-200 mg daily shortened the sinus cycle length by a mean of 12%, prolonged the pr interval by 8% and the qrs duration by 10%. efficacy was measured by the hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d), clinical global impression, and subjective mood ratings (45-item self-rating scale). among patients who increased their dose at 2 weeks, venlafaxine was significantly (p < 0.05) superior from week 3 onward on the ham-d. 6. significant decreases (p<.001) of 50% in the hypericum group and 58% in the fluoxetine group in the hamd score and of 42% and 52% on the ds spoke to the efficacy of both medications. there were no consistently significant differences between the two active drugs although a trend favored imipramine on a number of measures. fluoxetine was associated more frequently with nausea (p less than .05), while nortriptyline was associated more frequently with dry mouth (p less than .05). fluoxetine significantly decreased sleep efficiency and rem sleep and increased number of awakenings, stage 1 sleep, and rem latency compared with baseline. venlafaxine was superior in efficacy to fluoxetine; total scores for both the madrs and the ham-d were significantly (p < or = 0.05) lower in the venlafaxine group than in the fluoxetine group at weeks 4 and 6. recent memory improved significantly in the fluoxetine group but not in the amitriptyline group. for fluoxetine, ham-d scores were significantly lower at weeks 1 and 2 compared with those of trazodone. no statistically significant differences between the two treatment groups were noted regarding efficacy (hdrs, cgi) or safety (adverse events, laboratory examination, vital signs). both treatment groups showed a statistically significant improvement from baseline at one week, and this was maintained until the end of treatment for all of the following measures: hamilton rating scales for depression and anxiety, the montgomery asberg depression rating scale, clinical global impressions scale, zung self-rating scale for anxiety and the leeds sleep evaluation questionnaire. the decrease from baseline on the ham-d was larger in the mirtazapine than in the fluoxetine group throughout the treatment period, reaching statistical significance at days 21 and 28. improvement on the hamilton rating scale for depression was significant for both treatments from week 1 through the end of the study and did not differ between the two treatments at any week. in both treatment groups, mean scores on the hamilton depression rating scale decreased significantly between baseline (27.8, venlafaxine; 29.2, fluoxetine) and the end of the study (8.7, venlafaxine; 8.2, fluoxetine). as indicated by the significant decrease in the hamilton depression scale and the montgomery asberg depression scale, fluoxetine showed similar antidepressant effects to amitriptyline with significantly fewer adverse effects. suicidal feelings were reduced to a greater degree on fluoxetine than on mianserin and placebo at weeks 6 and 7. ham-a scores decreased by 59% for both treatment groups. analyses revealed no significant differences between treatments in the percentages of patients with substantial worsening, any worsening, worsening at endpoint, or improvement at endpoint in the ham-d sleep disturbance factor in either insomnia subgroup. the 2 treatment groups were similar in terms of number of hospitalisations and duration of stay, whether related to depression or not. no significant difference was shown between the two drugs, either in terms of efficacy (madrs, cgi, covi) or in terms of safety, except for the cgi 'severity of illness' which was lower at the end point with tianeptine than with fluoxetine. subset analyses of ham-d scores associated with anxiety and sleep revealed no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatments though improvement in anxiety scores was marginally greater for those receiving fluoxetine by the end of the trial. the frequencies of occurrence of adverse reactions were also similar, but sedation, nausea and vomiting were reported more frequently with fluoxetine, and insomnia was experienced with moclobemide. in fact clinical efficacy seems to remain comparable while side-effects are significantly less frequent. there were differences in the side-effect profiles, with fluvoxamine being associated with less nausea than fluoxetine. no differences in efficacy were found between the two groups. at day 42, the mean reductions in ham-d total score (compared with baseline) were 11.8 and 10.6 for the mirtazapine and fluoxetine groups, respectively; however, the changes were not statistically significant. we found that although clinically both drugs were equally effective, the improvement of memory performance in the fluoxetine-treated patients was significantly greater compared with that of the desipramine-treated patients. the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea, other gastrointestinal symptoms, nervousness, dizziness and sleep disorders. a significant difference was observed in females (fluoxetine, -17.8; maprotiline, -13.9; p=0.017) between treatment groups, but not in males. compared to imipramine, fluoxetine was associated with fewer complaints of dry mouth, constipation, and dizziness. venlafaxine xr but not fluoxetine was significantly better than placebo at week 2 on the ham-d depressed mood item. the efficacy and tolerability of moclobemide (300 or 600 mg daily) and fluoxetine (20 or 40 mg daily) were compared in a 6-week, double-blind study of 25 inpatients and 24 outpatients who had major depressive episodes without psychotic features (dsm-iii-r). significantly fewer fluoxetine-treated patients discontinued due to adverse events than did imipramine-treated patients (7% vs. 30%, respectively). common side effects of doxepin were dry mouth, drowsiness/sedation, constipation, and dizziness/lightheadedness. side-effect profiles were not significantly different between groups except for a significantly greater frequency of dose-related increase in heart rate > or = 100 bpm in milnacipran recipients and a significantly greater weight loss in fluoxetine recipients. headache and blurred vision were reported significantly more often (p < 0.05) in the fluoxetine group, whereas significantly more dry mouth was reported (p < 0.05) in the moclobemide group. venlafaxine and fluoxetine were well tolerated, with the most frequently experienced adverse events being nausea and headache. the drugs did not differ with respect to psychiatrists' ratings, but amitriptyline was slightly superior with respect to patients' ratings. both treatments resulted in some improvement in social adaptation self-evaluation scale total scores and this was more evident for those patients treated with reboxetine who achieved remission. both compounds proved to be similarly effective as measured by change in ham-d17, ham-d17 response, and ham-d17 remission rates. mean values for all efficacy measurements were improved over baseline with fluoxetine and imipramine treatment (p less than .001). before treatment, patients on average rated themselves as very impaired on psychological dimensions of general health and moderately impaired on physical dimensions, compared with population norms. assessment of anxiety using the hamilton anxiety rating scale (hars) and of sleep disturbances using a sleep questionnaire was carried out before treatment and at week 4. both drugs were effective and there were no statistically significant differences between them in the area under the curve of change from baseline in the hamilton depression rating scale (hamd) total score. patients in the fluoxetine group reported superior response on the health transition scale of the 36-item short-form health survey questionnaire and numerically greater improvement on the hamilton depression rating scale. the percentages of patients who achieved full remission of their depression (ham-d21 total score < or = 7) at the end of treatment were 37%, 22% and 18% for the venlafaxine xr, fluoxetine and placebo groups, respectively. significantly greater improvement for the sertraline group was apparent on the digit symbol substitution test, but not on two other measures of cognitive functioning. fluoxetine was found to have a more marked therapeutic effect than that of amineptine: better efficacy, fewer side-effects, and quicker and better improvement on the self evaluation scales. mean scores for most depression scales improved more in patients taking fluoxetine than in those receiving imipramine (p less than .05). a double-blind clinical trial was undertaken to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of fluoxetine compared with imipramine in the treatment of 59 outpatients suffering from major depressive disorder. during the six-week course of treatment with lohyp-57, the hamilton global score fell from 16.60 points at entry to 7.91 points, and in the fluoxetine sample it fell from 17.18 to 8.11 points. constipation, dyspepsia, tremor, sweating and abnormal ejaculation were more common in paroxetine-treated subjects, whereas nausea and nervousness were more frequent in fluoxetine-treated patients. paroxetine and fluoxetine showed comparable efficacy at the end of the 6-week treatment period, but a statistically significant difference in the number of responders at week 3 in favour of paroxetine was observed. no significant differences were observed between dropout rates in the two groups but anti-cholinergic side-effects were significantly more frequent with nortriptyline than with fluoxetine but there was no significant difference in cardiovascular effects in particular qtc prolongation. the results confirm the effectiveness and good tolerability of fluoxetine in the treatment of depressive disorders. no significant differences between treatment groups were found in the reductions in mean total score with the madrs, on visual analogue scales assessing the clinical profile of the compounds, fluoxetine was rated as exhibiting more psychostimulating activity than milnacipran (p = 0.0008). fluoxetine was comparable to amitriptyline in all efficacy measures except the hamd sleep factor. cognitive performance was evaluated by means of the buschke selective reminding test, the blessed information and memory test, the clifton assessment schedule, the cancellation task test, and the wechsler paired word test; the hamilton rating scale for depression (ham-d) and the clinical anxiety scale were administered to assess the course of depressive and anxiety symptoms, respectively. both groups showed a significant amelioration at the end point for hamilton rating scale of depression scores compared to the baseline value. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 178 patients with major depression depressive disorders 128 patients eligible to be randomized, with 66 patients receiving

potential amplitudes was detected. over the course of the study, five of the eight electrophysiological measures assessed showed significant improvement from baseline in the fidarestat-treated group, whereas no measure showed significant deterioration. no beneficial effect of sorbinil was demonstrated on either the clinical manifestation or on the neurophysiological measurements made in these neuropathic diabetic patients over 12 months of treatment. in placebo-treated subjects, there were decreases in exercise cardiac output (p < 0.03), stroke volume (p < 0.02), and end diastolic volume (p < 0.04). at 52 weeks, no significant differences were observed between the ponalrestat and placebo groups in motor (ulnar, median, and peroneal) or sensory (ulnar and radial) nerve conduction velocities, vibration perception thresholds, adjectival symptom scores or tests of autonomic function (mean electrocardiographic r-r interval variability on deep breathing and orthostatic blood pressure response). tolrestat 200 mg once daily was significantly better than placebo in producing concordant improvements in both motor nerve conduction velocities and paraesthetic symptom scores at 24 weeks (p = 0.01), 42 weeks (p = 0.01) and 52 weeks (p = 0.02). at 12 months, nerve function significantly improved in patients receiving tolrestat and deteriorated in patients taking placebo. compared with baseline values, postural hypotension decreased by a value of 5.9 mm hg (95% cl, 1.6 to 8.7); deep-breathing, maximum/minimum heart rate (expiration/inspiration ratio) increased by a value of 0.026 (cl, 0.015 to 0.036); and lying-to-standing heart rate ratio (30:15 ratio) increased by a value of 0.032 (cl, 0.027 to 0.052). the deterioration in mean vibration threshold of the tolrestat group was less than placebo at 24 weeks at all 3 sites measured, and reached significance at the carpal site (p less than 0.05). for the median motor, median sensory, and peroneal nerves, there were no benefits in maximum amplitudes over the follow-up period. the vibration perception threshold at two sites of the dominant leg improved by at least 3 volts in the tolrestat group and remained unchanged or slightly deteriorated in the control group. measurement of erythrocyte sorbitol concentrations demonstrated very significant inhibition of aldose reductase activity with sorbinil treatment, but no concomitant improvement in either peripheral or autonomic nerve function was observed. minimum latencies of f-wave of median and tibial motor nerves were significantly shortened by epalrestat (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively); however, no significant effects were observed in motor or sensory nerve conduction velocity. dose-dependent increments in sural nerve zenarestat level and sorbitol suppression were accompanied by significant improvement in ncv. they also had quantitative improvement in terms of the degree of paranodal demyelination, segmental demyelination, and myelin wrinkling. neither symptom scores nor cardiovascular reflexes, pupil reflexes and skin vasomotor reflexes improved after statil therapy, which led us to conclude that statil is not effective in the treatment of diabetic autonomic neuropathy. it is concluded that one-year treatment with ponalrestat has no beneficial effects on symptoms or electrophysiological parameters in diabetic neuropathy. no significant changes were observed in symptoms of pain, numbness, or paresthesia between ponalrestat and placebo groups, and there were no improvements in vpt or tt at several sites. after six months an improvement of analysed symptoms (pain and paraesthesias) and objective assessments (ncv-db) was observed in patients treated with tolrestat (group a) significantly higher than in patients treated with placebo (group b). neither did sorbinil induce marked changes in the fibrinolytic activities of the extrinsic, tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-pa), or in the intrinsic factor xii-dependent or factor xii-independent (urokinase-like) plasminogen activator systems. sural sensory velocity (p = 0.0008 in vitro platelet responsiveness to collagen and adenosine diphosphate (adp) increased in the placebo group (median change max% collagen + 8 (+2 to +30)%; adp +4.5 (0 to +20)% compared with a fall in the sorbinil treated patients (median change; collagen -17.5 (-2 to -40)%, p less than 0.05; adp, -4 (0 to -25)%, p less than 0.05). following the double-blind phase, motor and sensory nerve conduction velocity had significantly deteriorated in the placebo group, which did not occur during treatment with tolrestat. there was no evidence of continuing improvement throughout the treatment period and beneficial effects observed were no greater than those seen in previous trials of considerably shorter treatment periods. neurophysiological measurements, particularly of sensory amplitude, were considerably more sensitive than measurements of temperature and vibration sensation and remain of fundamental importance in measuring diabetic neuropathy at an early and potentially reversible stage. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients

double-blind conditions. a new, faster-acting nicotine nasal spray (nns) can provide easily self-administered relief from cigarette withdrawal. in this latter group there were significant differences (p=0.03) between those who had follow up in clinics (39% stopped) compared to those who were followed up telephone sessions (30%). there was a main treatment effect for abstinence favoring the high counseling condition in early follow-up (week 12) and for continuous abstinence. significantly more participants who had used the nicotine inhalers were continuously abstinent compared with those who had used the placebo inhalers. smoking cessation efficacy was maintained 6 months after initiation of treatment: 34 percent vs 21 percent (p = 0.08 in study 1) and 18 percent vs 7 percent (p = 0.05 in study 2). decreased cost also increased cessation attempts and 1-week cessation (p less than 0.05) and appeared to increase abstinence at 6-month follow-up (19% vs 6% vs 8%, p less than 0.10). a logistic regression model of eot quit rates showed smokers who preferred transdermal nicotine, were not reactive to smoking cues, and did not use nicotine to alleviate distress or stimulate cognitive function had higher quit rates on transdermal nicotine. smoking abstinence was not lower and the odds ratio for nicotine patch therapy was not greater in smokers with a history of alcohol dependence than in smokers with no such history. those receiving nicotine gum were more likely to be abstinent at the 2- and 6-month follow-ups. nicotine patch treatment doubled the rate of continuous abstinence up to 1 year (nicotine 9.6%, placebo 4.8%, p < 0.01); it most likely worked by reducing withdrawal symptoms. the opioid antagonist naltrexone was not found to be effective for smoking cessation and had no significant effect on daily cigarette consumption or craving. the patches were generally well tolerated, although 25% of subjects in the nicotine group and 13% in the placebo group had transient local erythema after application of the patch; 5 members of the nicotine group withdrew because of poor cutaneous tolerance. subjects with high scores (> 7) on fagerström's tolerance questionnaire had a significantly lower success rate with placebo than with the nicotine spray. biological verification of gum use and smoking abstinence were assessed in community volunteers who attended an intensive behavioral counseling program for smoking cessation while using nicotine gum for 3 months. relative to the pp group, the aa and ap groups were each significantly more likely to be abstinent at 1 week, end of treatment, and 6 months but not at 12 months postquit. there was no significant relationship between weight gained and relapse in individuals. nicotine mouth spray delivered significantly higher attendance to sessions did appear to consistently increase the likelihood of quitting smoking at posttest and at each of the follow-ups. time to relapse was slower with extended versus standard therapy (hazard ratio, 0.50 [ci, 0.35 to 0.73]; p < 0.001). of 200 who were willing to try the gum, 101 were randomly allocated to the nicotine gum and 99 to the placebo gum. in no treatment group was the outcome significantly different from that for one-time counselling at the (p less than 0.05) level. tenseness, difficulty in concentration and feelings of hunger were consistently and in part significantly lessened in the tns group. mean birth weight difference was 186 g (95% ci 35, 336 g) higher in the nicotine than placebo group, and there was an insignificantly lower rate of low birth weight (under 2500 g) in the former group. by 6 months there was no significant difference between the two groups (22/136 (16%) as+nrt and 15/109 (14%) as). biochemically validated smoking-cessation rates were not significantly higher with nicotine gum compared with placebo (after 6 weeks of treatment: 13% compared with 9.6%, p=.45; at 32-34 weeks of gestation: 18% compared with 14.9%, p=.56). the overall success rate for sustained smoking reduction was significantly higher at all time-points for active versus placebo gum (6.3% versus 0.5% after 24 months). nrt dose, level of nicotine dependence and genotype scores displayed significant interactive effects on successful quitting. nineteen (63%, 95% confidence interval, ci, 46%-80%) of the smokers treated with the transdermal nicotine patch had successfully quit smoking at the end of the program (6 weeks) and nine (30%, 95% ci 14%-46%) remained abstinent 1 year later. smoking cessation rates for the two nicotine patch doses and three levels of counseling did not differ significantly at either 8 weeks or 26 weeks following the quit date. smoking cessation rates were statistically significantly superior with sublingual nicotine vs placebo for all measures of abstinence: 6-month point prevalence, 23% vs 10%; 12-month point prevalence, 17% vs 10%. nicotine abstinence rates in the 21- and 42-mg np conditions on week 36 follow-up were 16.9% and 9.2%, respectively. the difference between the groups was significant for validated point prevalence abstinence at discharge (55%, 43%, 37% respectively, p=0.045) and at 12 months (17%, 6%, 8%, p=0.03). skills training produced higher initial cessation and more coping responses posttreatment than did support. the differences in quit rates and tobacco withdrawal symptoms between the two active groups were not statistically significant. prolonged abstinence rates (co<10 ppm) did not differ among gradual, abrupt and minimal treatment conditions (4%, 7% and 5%), nor did 7-day point prevalence rates (7%, 11% and 11%). at 12 weeks 21/315 (6.7%) subjects allocated to active treatment had stopped smoking compared with 6/314 (1.9%) allocated to placebo (absolute difference 4.7%; 95% confidence interval 1.6% to 7.9%; p = 0.003). abstinence rates for daily nicotine gum users (n = 64) at 12 months and again at 24 months remained 48.4%, as compared with 26.1% and 31.9% for the daily placebo gum users (n = 69). this study was designed to see whether the offer and prescription of nicotine chewing gum would enhance the efficacy of general practitioners' advice to stop smoking. the abstinence rates were 51, 39 and 29% after 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, respectively, as compared to 24, 19 and 18% in the placebo group (p=0.0003; p=0.003; p=0.050). the nicotine lozenge is a safe and effective new treatment for smoking cessation in low- and high-dependence smokers. the 12 month sustained success rates were: 25 mg patch for 22 weeks (l-25), 15.4%; 25 mg patch for 8 weeks (s-25), 15.9%; 15 mg patch for 22 weeks (l-15), 13.7%; 15 mg patch for 8 weeks (s-15), 11.7%; and placebo (p-0) 9.9% (placebo versus 15 mg, p<0.05; 25 mg versus 15 mg, p<0.03; 25 mg versus placebo, p<0.001, chi-squared test). after multiple adjustments, the abstinence proportions ratios seemed to follow a "dose-response" pattern: compared to gb, the ratios were 0.85 (g1-g2), 1.13 (g3-g4), 1.51 (gba), 1.66 (g1a-g2a), and 1.75 (g3a-g4a). after one year, these rates declined to 23% and 16%, respectively (p=0.476), and converged to 18% and 14% (p=0.797), respectively, at 5-year follow-up. after 6 weeks of treatment, co-validated abstinence rates were 48% in the active group and 23% in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). there was no significant difference in the rate of abstinence from the quit date until delivery between the nicotine-replacement and placebo groups (9.4% and 7.6%, respectively; unadjusted odds ratio with nicotine-replacement therapy, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.82 to 1.96), although the rate was higher at 1 month in the nicotine-replacement group than in the placebo group (21.3% vs. 11.7%). compared with placebo control subjects, participants assigned nicotine patches had higher 3-month (23.4% vs 11.4%; p < .01) and 6-month subjects who received transdermal nicotine were significantly more likely than placebo-treated subjects to remain abstinent from smoking during treatment, but not at the 1-year follow-up. there is no evidence from this study that the offer of 2 mg of nicotine-bearing gum enhances smoking cessation rates when added to a comprehensive intervention offered to all smokers in primary care. women in the cbt+nrt arm were almost three times more likely than women in the cbt-only arm to have biochemically validated cessation at both pregnancy time points (after 7 weeks: 24% vs 8%, p=0.02; at 38 weeks gestation: 18% vs 7%, p=0.04), but not at 3 months postpartum (20% vs 14%, p=0.55). at baseline, there were no significant differences among the three treatment groups with regard to age, gender, educational level, duration of smoking, number of cigarettes smoked per day, concomitant disease states or drug use, or fagerstrom score. sustained abstinence rates for the patch and nasal spray group and patch only group were 51% v 35% after 6 weeks (odds ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.17% to 3.32; p=0.011(chi2), 37% v 25% after 3 months (1.76, 1.01 to 3.08; p=0.045), 31% v 16% after 6 months (2.40, 1.27 to 4.50; p=0.005), 27% v 11% after 12 months (3.03, 1.50 to 6.14; p=0.001), and 16% v 9% after 6 years (2.09, 0.93 to 4.72; p=0.08) [corrected]. after 1 month the percentage of confirmed non-smokers in the nicotine gum group was 34%, in placebo chewing gum group 37% and the control group 24%. weight gain at seven weeks was significantly less in the combined-treatment group than in the bupropion group and the placebo group (p<0.05 for both comparisons). after a one-year follow-up period, the success rates were in the same order of magnitude for nicotine gum (active treatment: 10%, placebo: 8%) group and for acupuncture (active treatment: 8%, placebo: 10%) group. more subjects in the nicotine group (70/94 v 45/93) reported that the gum reduced the craving for smoking. short tns treatment (3 weeks) is at least as effective as a longer one (6 weeks), which is relevant both medically and economically. a slight increase in adverse cardiovascular events was noted only in the open label-pay group in comparison with the placebo group. at 2 months, tnp produced a higher level of abstinence (36%) than placebo (20%), p < .001. at least 1 adverse event was reported by 57% receiving the nicotine patch and 39% receiving placebo (p<.001). between six months and one year, relapse in the nicotine group accounted for the 30% vs. 20% success rates for nicotine and placebo observed at one year. the results at 12 months were that long follow-up showed a trend (p less than 0.12 toward being better than short follow-up, while nicotine gum was significantly better than no gum (p less than 0.05) in maintaining abstinence. higher smoking cessation rates were also observed in subjects assigned to the active patch who had lower serum levels of nicotine and cotinine at baseline, and withdrawal symptom relief was better in the active patch group compared with placebo. all pharmacotherapies differed from placebo when examined without protection for multiple comparisons (odds ratios, 1.63-2.34). continuous smoking abstinence was significantly higher for the active nicotine inhaler group compared with the placebo inhaler group. the nicotine sublingual tablet increased the smoking cessation rate compared to placebo, reduced craving in highly dependent smokers and was well tolerated. the 12-month point prevalence was 6% (5-mg patch (placebo)), 16% (15-mg patch) (p<0.05), 9% (inhaler) and 11% (15-mg patch plus inhaler), respectively. six-months' continuous abstinence rates were also significantly higher among the active nicotine group (25%) compared with placebo (12%). nicotine-treated subjects reached significantly higher abstinence rates during and at the end of treatment than both placebo- and control-subjects: 69% in the nicotine condition, 51.2% and 44.4% under placebo and control conditions respectively. the differences in outcomes were significant at the 5 percent level for all comparisons, with the exception of the 2-mg nicotine gum versus the placebo gum at one year. effects for gum were no longer significant at later follow-ups, however, overall duration and level of nicotine gum use were considerably less than optimal. at six weeks, the nicotine gum group was superior to both the self-help and control conditions. rates of sustained abstinence were significantly better with active treatment than with placebo: 53, 41, 24, and 17 percent of those in the nicotine-patch group were abstinent after 6, 12, 26, and 52 weeks, respectively, as compared with 17, 10, 5, and 4 percent of those in the placebo-patch group (p less than 0.0001). the rate of smoking was significantly reduced in volunteer subjects by providing effective nicotine replacement, self-help material, and weekly visits with a nurse for 6 weeks. results showed that precessation nicotine patch treatment was associated with a significantly higher rate of continuous smoking abstinence at 4 weeks, regardless of cigarette condition. although significant differences in the percentage of abstainers were observed between groups sbcn and sbc three weeks after treatment (39% vs. 26%), the point prevalence abstinence rate for patients at 12 months declined to 19, 18, and 12% for groups sbcn, sbc, and an, respectively. the present study shows no difference between physician versus nurse counseling and no improvement in the proportion of quitters with the addition of nicotine gum in the physician-counseled group. no treatment differences were found in trends over time for measures of mood, withdrawal symptoms, pleasant activities and events, self-efficacy, and optimism and pessimism. seven-day quit rates for nicotine gum were no better than for the placebo group (14.2% versus 11.1%, p = 0.232) at 6 months. the results of this trial do not support the routine use of higher dose nicotine patch therapy in the treatment of nicotine dependence. the success rate was 35.1 in the first group and 13.2 in the second (p less than 0.03), thus confirming the effectiveness of nicotine chewing gum. abstinence rates at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months were 29.5%, 21.8%, and 20.5% in the active group, and 8.8%, 3.8%, and 2.5% in the placebo group (p < or = .001 for each comparison), respectively. precessation mecamylamine significantly prolonged the duration of continuous smoking abstinence; abstinence rates at the end of treatment were 47.5% with mecamylamine and 27.5% without mecamylamine. mean compliance across groups was higher for the patch (mean: 78.4-82.8%) than for the gum (mean: 38.5-50.7%). however, at 6-month follow-up, the subjects who had received behavioral treatment had a significantly better abstinence rate (36.7%) than those receiving education (17.5%). after corrections for marital status and income, 10% of those who received nicotine gum and 7% of those who received placebo gum reported continuous abstinence for 11 months and passed observer and biochemical verification (this difference was not statistically significant). at 12 months, the frequency of respiratory symptoms in abstinent subjects fell significantly and lung function showed a trend toward improvement. the ncg group had higher rates of abstinence at all follow-up points, but the difference approached statistical significance at 3 months only (p less than .10). there were significant differences in a 7-day point prevalence but not continuous abstinence rates between treatment groups across targeted end points. retention rates were highest in the bup group (59.3%) and lowest in the nrt group (50.5%). there was a significant increase in smoking cessation rates after 8 weeks of follow-up but only among smokers who started on 21-mg/day patches. abstinence at 1 year was.77% in the otc condition versus 3.08% in the hcp condition [p<.01]. more general distress was observed among bt versus btp participants (i.e., increased withdrawal, tension, fatigue, and coping frequency with decreased coping effort; coping-to-urge ratio). the interaction of nicotine-gum dose and dependence group was not significant (p = 0.42), nor did the 2-mg and 4-mg doses differ significantly in effectiveness, though both 2-mg and 4-mg gum were significantly more effective than placebo gum. there were no significant differences between conditions in point-prevalence abstinence rates or in time to first slip. smokers on active gum were significantly more likely to achieve initial cessation (2 mg: or=1.42; 4 mg: or=1.90); 28-day continuous abstinence (2 mg: or=2.01; 4 mg: or=4.66); and continuous abstinence at 6 months (2 mg: or=1.80; 4 mg: or=5.96). at 6 weeks, the 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence rate for the patch alone (21.1%) was superior to the spray (13.6%) but was significantly lower than the rate for combination therapy (27.1%). eight weeks after the target quit date, self-reported 4-week abstinence rates were 41.6% in the precessation treatment group and 44.4% in the usual care group (p = .61). replacement was similar in groups lc-15 and hc-25, but the success rate was significantly lower in hc-25 group, despite similar levels of withdrawal symptoms. a higher percentage of cotinine replacement was associated with the higher 8-week smoking abstinence rate (p = .03), an association not found at long-term follow-up. at one year follow up 15.5% overall had stopped smoking, 14% in the low and 17% in the high contact group. at 3 months 36.2% of the 2 mg nicotine gum group reported to have stopped smoking, against 44.8% in the 4 mg group (non-significant difference). ratings on smoking types 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 and f-score were related to success rates. transdermal nicotine does not cause a significant increase in cardiovascular events in high-risk outpatients with cardiac disease. abstinence rates for the transdermal nicotine and nicotine nasal spray groups were not significantly different at 6-month follow-up (15.0% vs. 12.2%, respectively; p > 0.2). compared with the no-gum group, relapse occurred at a significantly lower rate in the gum group for the entire 12 months of follow-up (odds of relapse in the gum group was 0.72, 95% confidence interval, 0.62 to 0.83). time to relapse is significantly longer in group 1 as compared to that of group 2 (p = 0.041), whereas no significant differences between groups 2 and 3 were observed. at 6-month follow-up, abstinence rates for the three treatments were 4.9, 6.5, and 9.7% for the mc, cpp, and cap treatments, respectively. familiarizing with the gum as compared with regular use gave fewer reports of side effects, 15% vs 34%, p < 0.001. results showed that smokers with high levels of nicotine dependence were significantly more likely to quit smoking during treatment if they received nicotine gum (31.9%) than high-dependence smokers who did not receive the gum (12.2%). cessation rates in smokers attending special clinics or their general practitioners can be increased by transdermal nicotine (tns). survival analysis showed active inhaler was superior to placebo (p < 0.01). few side effects were reported. quit rates were dose-related at all follow-ups (p < 0.01). point abstinence at 7 weeks was 58% for mecamylamine versus 29% for placebo, p = 0.044. corresponding figures after two years were 19 (9.5%) and 6 (3.0%) (p=0.012). the treatment mainly benefited smokers with lower levels of dependence, based on fagerström test for nicotine dependence score. overall sustained abstinence was documented in 17% of subjects at 6 months; 22% and 12% for ap and pp, respectively (p = 0.03). the nicotine patch significantly improves short-term quit rates in inner-city african americans who are interested in trying to quit smoking. (relative risk 1.08 95% ci: 0.86, 1.35, p = 0.4, risk difference 1.7%, 95% ci: -3.2%, 6.6%). in this comparative effectiveness study of 5 tobacco dependence treatments, combination pharmacotherapy significantly increased abstinence compared with monotherapies. over the next 6 months, the two higher doses appeared to support more gum self-administration than the two lower doses (4 mg = 2 mg greater than 0.5 mg = 0 mg) in the subsample of long-term quitters (n = 20). a double-blind trial of a smoking-withdrawal chewing gum containing 2 mg nicotine was conducted with 100 consecutive patients in a smoking cessation clinic. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> eighty-nine smokers general practice in italy participants were 96 men and women with a diagnosis of alcohol abuse or dependence and smoking 15 or more cigarettes per day primary care clinics 2110 adult cigarette smokers originally recruited to a study of the effect of antismoking advice in general practice, 429 who reported at follow up after one year that they had tried unsuccessfully to stop smoking were offered "a special antismoking chewing gum," either participants who smoked more than 20 cigarettes a day were treated with the 30 cm2 patch and the others with the 20 cm2 patch pulmonary outpatient clinics 1,218 smokers able to quit smoking for 48 hr 1050 participants, 521 were randomly assigned to low-dependence smokers high-risk outpatients with cardiac disease in a sample of alcohol-dependent tobacco smokers in an early phase of out-patient alcohol treatment postmenopausal smokers (n=152) received 13 physicians working in the open health care system those with baseline cotinine < or = 250 ng.ml-1 (low cotinine smokers 1346 primary care patients attending routine appointments were recruited by medical assistants in 12 primary care clinics smokers attending special clinics or their general practitioners smokers with a history of alcoholism smokers not motivated or not able to quit smoking with regard to smoking reduction and smoking cessation 12 medical sites participating in the national cancer institute's community clinical oncology program 244 subjects a total of 120 participants were randomized (72% white, 70% female;

in a-a oxygen gradient (p < 0.01), but patients in group ii exhibited significantly lower increases in postoperative a-a oxygen gradient (p < 0.006). levels of urinary nag/creatinine ratio, plasma creatinine and serum cystatin c did not significantly differ between nac and placebo groups during five postoperative days. there was no difference in the proportion of patients with postoperative renal dysfunction (29.7% vs 29.0%, p = .89; relative risk [rr], 1.03 [95% confidence interval {ci}, 0.72-1.46]) in the n-acetylcysteine and placebo groups, respectively. creatine kinase mb isoform (ck-mb) mass levels did not significantly differ between the groups at both preoperative and postoperative periods. creatine kinase-mb levels at 6 and 12 hours were significantly lower in the nac group (p = 0.02). the results indicated that nac improved oxygenation (increase in pao(2)/fio(2)) and decreased mortality rate in treated patients compared to control group (p<0.05). the transplantation rate was lower in the nac group but was not significantly different between groups (32% vs 45%; p = .093). this study failed to show any beneficial effect of the intraoperative administration of nac on hemodynamics and graft function in liver transplantation in patients with chronic liver disease. the oxidative burst response of neutrophils in the patients receiving nac was significantly low at all times during bypass. plasma il-6 was lower on days 4-5 (p<0.05), il-8 on days 4-6 (p<0.05) and il-10 on days 4-6 (p<0.05) in nac group. the median percent change in egfr was 5.2% better (absolute difference) in the n-acetylcysteine arm (95% confidence interval 2.4% worse to 12.1% better; p=0.22). interleukin-8 decreased significantly only in those who received n-acetylcysteine (p =.0081). the nac and placebo groups (32 and 29 patients, respectively) were comparable at icu admission for severity of illness assessed by the simplified acute physiology score (saps) (10.8 +/- there was no significant attenuation in the increase in serum creatinine from baseline to peak when comparing n-acetylcysteine with placebo (64.5 +/- there was no significant difference between the two groups in any of the six organ dysfunction parameters, length of intensive care stay, days of mechanical ventilation and mortality. no differences were found in postoperative biochemical markers (troponin t, creatine kinase mb, creatinine, hemoglobin, and platelets) between the groups. there were no significant differences between groups in any of the measurements before treatment and after the return to baseline f1o2 at the end of the study, respectively. there was no difference in either daily organ failure score over time (p > .01, repeated-measures analysis of variance) or hospital mortality rate (90% n-acetyl-l-cysteine group, 50% placebo group) (p > .1, logistic regression) between the two groups. in both groups, the fio2 was significantly lower and the pao2/fio2 ratio was significantly higher than the initial values during the evolution (fio2 at day 3, p < .01 for nac and p acetylcysteine treated patients had a lower incidence of cerebral oedema (40% (10/25) v 68% (17/25); p = 0.047, 95% confidence interval for difference in incidence 2% to 54%), and fewer developed hypotension requiring inotropic support (48%

gastric intramucosal ph and arterial oxygen tension/inspired fractional oxygen ratio (p > 0.05). plasma concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (tnf), interleukin (il)-6, il-8, il-10, and soluble tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor-p55 (stnfr-p55) were measured by sensitive immunoassays at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 24 h. the urinary nag/creatinine ratio increased significantly from baseline to before crossclamp and remained increased on day 5 in both groups. ethane and mda concentrations were significantly reduced in the treatment groups after day 6. there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups regarding outcome as indicated by mortality and the required days of inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and intensive care. the n-acetylcysteine responders had a higher survival rate (69%) than the non-responders (19%) and were studied earlier after onset of sepsis (37 hrs) than the nonresponders (61 hrs). no improvement could be demonstrated in the pao2/fio2 ratio in the study group as compared with the control group on any day. iv nac did not affect survival, graft function or risk of aki. the rate of af was lower in nac group compared with placebo group (three patients in nac group [5.2%] and 12 patients in placebo group [21.1%] had postoperative af; odds ratio [or] 0.20; 95% confidence interval [ci] 0.05 to 0.77; p = 0.019). the change in left ventricular cardiomyocyte staining (end of cardiopulmonary bypass--before cardiopulmonary bypass) differed significantly between groups for both primary measures: 8-iso-prostaglandin-f(2)alpha, -1.8 +/- the overall mortality was 23% (10/42) and was not different (p = 0.209) in nac group (33.3%) when compared with control (16.7%), the same occurring with the

nac vs placebo, respectively, at 24 h and at 48 h). there were no significant effects on mortality, morbidity or postoperative graft function. the aagp and crp values were both elevated during cpb in the two groups without a significant difference, but 6 and 24 h post-cpb, the values were significantly higher in the control group than in the study group. nac had no significant effect on mortality, lactate clearance times (p = 0.74), or coma recovery times (p = 0.46). the difference between arterial and gastric mucosal carbon dioxide tension decreased (p = .05) and megx increased (p = .04). there was no difference in mortality among groups (placebo, 40%; nac, 36%; otz, 35%). n-acetylcysteine infusion did not increase oxygen extraction or result in an improvement in whole-blood lactate

with respect to restoration of plasma volume and hemodynamic stability. for the duration of the study and at 48 hours, there was no statistically significant difference between groups with respect to the following: cardiac index, colloid osmotic pressure (cop), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (pcwp), cop-pcwp gradient, right and left ventricular stroke work indices, and amount of constant positive airway pressure required for treatment. infusion rates and 8-hour intake were higher for the group receiving normal saline solution (p less than 0.001), as was postoperative weight gain (p less than 0.01), although urine and chest tube outputs did not differ. the effects of intraoperative changes in plasma colloid osmotic pressure (cop) on the formation of intestinal edema were studied in patients during modified whipple's operation (hemipancreato-duodenectomy). perioperative blood loss and coagulation profiles were similar between the groups, but the postoperative hemoglobin level was higher in the crystalloid group. patients in the colloid groups postoperatively had a higher serum colloid osmotic pressure (s-cop), but a higher net lung capillary filtration pressure (delta p) only on the second postoperative day than the rac group. the proportion of patients with new single-organ and multiple-organ failure was similar in the two groups (p=0.85). there was a significant difference (p < .03) in overall (30 days) survival rate between hsd (73%) and is (64%) groups. there was no difference in the postoperative course between the two groups; however, by using the lower cop limit the postoperative albumin consumption in the intensive care unit was reduced significantly and thus the costs of treatment were lowered. after volume loading, the stroke index increased in both groups, but the left ventricular stroke work index increased in group 2 only. in penetrating trauma, maximum sequential organ function scores were lower with hes than with saline (median 2.4 vs 4.5, p=0.012). all three colloids led to a transient increase in activated partial thromboplastin time postsurgery and also a transient fall in the concentration of factor viii, which were accompanied by a transient increase in bleeding time, but there was no measurable increase in blood loss. maximum platelet aggregation (ranging from -23% to -44% relative from baseline value) and maximum gradient of platelet aggregation (ranging from -26% to -45% relative from baseline values) were reduced only in the hmw-hes patients. there were no apparent differences in circulatory variables, alveolo-arterial oxygen tension difference, incidence of wound infection or postoperative restoration of intestinal activity between the groups. although patients receiving saline boluses had significantly more oliguria during a course of therapy, weight gain, number of il-2 doses, tachycardia, hypotension, vasopressor use, hospital stay, and clinical response rates did not significantly differ between arms. at 90 days after randomization, 201 of 398 patients (51%) assigned to hes 130/0.42 had died, as compared with 172 of 400 patients (43%) assigned to ringer's acetate (relative risk, 1.17; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.01 to 1.36; p=0.03); 1 patient in each group had end-stage kidney failure. adverse events were observed only with hypertonic solution administration: hypotensive episodes, sudden increases in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and ventricular arrhythmias. blood pressure in the hypertonic/hyperoncotic group increased 49 mmhg during transport (p less than 0.005); blood pressure in patients given lactated ringer's solution increased 19 mmhg (ns). sublingual capillary density was similar in both groups (21 ± 8 versus 20 ± 3 vessels/mm(2)); but capillary microvascular flow index, percent of perfused capillaries, and perfused capillary density were higher in 6% hes 130/0.4 (2.5 ± 0.5 versus 1.6 ± 0.7, 84 ± 15 versus 53 ± 26%, and 19 ± 6 versus 11 ± 5 vessels/mm(2), respectively, p < .005). the differences between groups were significant throughout 24 h. urine output and improvement of the glasgow coma score were also higher in h/h patients than in the control group (p less than 0.05). the accuracy of the stat-crit hematocrit (hct) was compared to coulter and centrifuge methods in this study of the interrelationship between non-red cell blood constituents and accuracy of conductivity-based hct measurements. with regard to hemodynamic efficiency and the change in laboratory data no relevant differences between group i, ii and iii could be seen. maximum decrease in cop was 40% (p less than 0.001) in the rl group and was insignificant in the alb group. in conclusion, postoperative fluid substitution with dextran has no advantages over crystalloids only, with regard to granulation tissue formation if postoperative fluid support is optimum, according to psco2 measurements. the results were consistent across centers and across subgroups according to the severity of shock and status with respect to malaria, coma, sepsis, acidosis, and severe anemia. pulmonary shunt fraction (qsp/qt) did not change in groups a and c but decreased during cpb in group h (from 0.22 +/- there was high correlation (r = 0.951) between measured cop and values calculated from tpri in patients receiving hypertonic fluid, colloid containing hypertonic fluid, or no fluid:cop = 4.08 (tpri)--4.61. mortality rates were similar in the two groups (p = 0.725). there were no complications associated with the infusion of the hypertonic saline-dextran solution, and execution of the protocol by paramedic personnel was both safe and uniformly successful. there was no significant difference in apache ii score between hs+hes group (13.2 ± 1.9) and hes group (14.0 ± 1.6), and the apacheii score in hs+hes group was significantly lower than that in rl group (15.2 ± 1.7, p <0.01). both the hs-ns and hs-bs (colloid) groups had a significantly less frequent incidence of nausea and vomiting, use of rescue antiemetics, severe pain, periorbital edema, and double vision. the 7.5% nacl solution significantly improved upon the predicted survival for the entire cohort and for high-risk patients when compared with the survival estimates from the triss methodology. there was no significant correlation between venous admixture, on the one hand, and pop, mpaop, pop-mpaop difference, total sodium intake or net supply of non-colloid fluids, on the other. there was no difference in 28-day survival-hsd: 74.5% (0.1; 95% confidence interval [ci], -7.5 to 7.8); colloid osmotic pressure (cop) decreased in the saline group and increased in the colloid groups (p< 0.001). total intravascular albumin decreased from 0.7 g/kg (1.4 to 0.7 g/kg) in both groups, corresponding to a plasma volume (pv) loss of 13 mg/kg without fluid infusions. treatment with 5 percent albumin from day 0 to day 14 does not decrease the burden of mods in adult burn patients. during knee replacement surgery a pronounced activation of the coagulation/fibrinolytic system was observed, regardless of whether patients received crystalloid or colloid fluids. there were significant increases in qs/qt and aado2, 48 hours after operation in group 3. in patients undergoing major surgery, volume resuscitation with medium molecular weight hes improves the splanchnic blood flow and tissue oxygenation. the measured lung water in each treatment group was significantly different from one another (p less than 0.001). pt, aptt and the levels of t-pa showed no significant differences between two groups at different time points, but the levels of plasma pai (μg/l) of the hes group decreased gradually, and was significantly lower than that before resuscitation and rl group at 24 hours after resuscitation (41.76 ± 25.95 vs. 89.11 ± 14.27, 55.08 ± 35.43, both p < 0.05). ml/kg/per cent burn (rl-colloid) at 48 h (p less than 0.01). systemic hemodynamics and oxygenation (pao(2), paco(2)) did not differ significantly between the two volume groups throughout the study. despite reduced need for extra i.v. fluid and decreased cumulative fluid balance, after hsd infusion the patients had increased filling pressures of the heart with improved cardiac output. baseline values for pv, isfv, ecfv, and oxygen delivery index did not differ between treatment groups. survival to hospital discharge in patients with baseline glasgow coma scale scores of 8 or less was correlated with treatment group (p < .05 by logistic regression and p < .01 by cox proportional-hazards analysis; with survival in the hypertonic saline solution group [34%] vs lactated ringer's solution group [12%]). in the hes group, the iap was significantly lower in 2 to 7 days, and fewer patients received mechanical ventilation (15.0% vs 47.6%). there was no significant correlation between left ventricular stroke work index and pwp in these patients, either at the completion of resuscitation or during the following three days. postoperative values of albumin concentration, circulating albumin mass and pis were significantly greater in the albumin group in comparison to the electrolyte group. there was no difference between akin and rifle criteria among groups and no difference in mortality, coagulation, or pruritus up to 90 days after treatment initiation. haemodynamic stability was achieved in both groups throughout the study period, as judged from mean arterial pressure, central venous pressure, pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, and cardiac index. all the children survived, and there was no clear advantage to using any of the 4 fluids, but the longest recovery times occurred in the lactated ringer's group. there was no difference in ventilatory parameters, blood gases, pulmonary function tests, ventilator days, or hospital days between the two groups. the group receiving saline solution had better cardiorespiratory recovery with shorter extubation time (p = 0.033), and earlier increase in cardiac index with a positive correlation between plasma sodium content and cardiac index. the post-operative changes observed in ecv were not related to copp in the range 33 mmhg to 21 mmhg. cardiac output and qs/qt increased in both groups. infusion of 250 ml hypertonic saline solution in patients with severe hypovolemia was not related to any complications, nor did it affect mortality rates; it improved map significantly, acutely expanded plasma volume by 24%, and reduced significantly the volumes of crystalloids and blood required in their resuscitation. serum concentrations of interleukin (il)-6, il-8 and il-10 and soluble adhesion molecules (selam-1 and sicam-1) were measured after induction of anesthesia, four hours after the end of surgery, as well as 24 hr and 48 hr postoperatively. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> patients with severe sepsis or septic shock hypovolemic shock blunt and penetrating trauma surgical

placebo enema (p less than 0.001) but no difference was detected among the patients receiving differing concentrations of 5-asa. budesonide and 5-asa enemas both resulted in a significant improvement in endoscopy and histopathology scores but no difference could be demonstrated between the two treatment groups. there was no significant difference with respect to age, male/female ratio, past history of proctosigmoiditis, length of colorectum involved at the time of initial presentation, symptom resolution, and endoscopic and histologic improvement among the three treatment groups. at 4 weeks clinical remission was achieved in 7 of 31 (39%) patients with placebo, in 22 of 32 (69%) patients in the 1 g mesalazine group, and 23 of 31 (74%) patients in the 1.5 g mesalazine group. improvement or remission was seen in 77% of the 5-aminosalicylic acid-treated patients and in 72% of the prednisolone-treated patients (p greater than 0.05). patient evaluation of therapy showed that foam was much better accepted than enema because foam was more comfortable, more practical, easier to retain, and interfered less with daily living.(abstract truncated at 250 words) salofalk foam and enema are equally effective for the treatment of proctitis, proctosigmoiditis and left-sided ulcerative colitis. a significant decrease in the dai score (p < 0.05) was observed in both treatment groups, with a clinical remission rate of 36.7% in the bdp group and of 29.2% in the 5-asa group. fifty-two patients with mild to moderate distal ulcerative colitis were randomized under double-blind conditions to receive a rectal preparation of either pentasa (1 g/day) or cortenema (100 mg/day) for 3 wk. in this study mesalazine foam enema was superior to prednisolone foam enema with regards to clinical remission, this was supported by favourable trends in sigmoidoscopic and histological remission rates. the difference between the treatment groups was statistically significant (p = 0.02) due to a better effect of mesalazine in patients with proctitis. the foam enemas were generally well-tolerated, and no treatment-related changes on laboratory variables and vital signs were noted. since no difference was registered between the two types of treatment (p = 0.141, x2 test), 4-asa could be a possible form of treatment for active ulcerative colitis. the combination of bdp and 5-asa was significantly superior to single-agent therapy in terms of both improved sigmoidoscopic and improved histological score. endoscopic remission rates at week 4 were 51 and 52% for the mesalazine gel and foam enemas, respectively (p = 0.925). the combination of oral and rectal mesalamine therapy was well tolerated and produced earlier and more complete relief of rectal bleeding than oral or rectal therapy alone. the patients' evaluation for tolerability and practicality showed that the pentasa suppository was significantly superior to the claversal suppository. the active drug conferred significant benefit compared with placebo as shown by several criteria, but this benefit was confined to patients not already taking sulphasalazine by mouth. patients with active distal proctitis received either 5-aminosalicylic (5-asa) acid or identical placebo suppositories, 500 mg t.i.d. for 6 weeks. remission rates at w2 were 48.1 %versus 50.6% in itt (97.5% ci -12.8%) and 49.1%versus 52.1% in pp (97.5% ci -13.8%) in foam versus liquid, respectively. the disease activity index lowered at t8 versus t4 in the beclomethasone diproprionate enema and foam the foam enema was shown to be as efficacious as the reference, even though the daily dose in the foam treatment contained only half as much active drug as in the reference treatment. mean disease activity index declined 55% for patients on 5-aminosalicylic acid and 24% for patients on placebo (p = 0.0001). the low-volume foam was associated with a lower frequency of severe discomfort, pain and retention problems. endoscopic, clinical, and histologic improvement were comparable in the two treatment groups. endoscopic remission was achieved by 45.0% of patients on 5-asa mmx and by 36.8% of those on enema, whereas 15.0% and 8% of patients, respectively, showed histologic remission. alicaforsen is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 protein expression with activity in subjects with ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. no difference could be observed in terms of efficacy; however, it was the patients' opinion that treatment with suppositories was easier than that with enemas (p less than 0.01). improvement in clinical score was achieved in seven of nine 5-asa enema-treated patients versus one of nine hydrocortisone enema-treated patients (p less than 0.05). improvement in mean disease activity index score was significantly greater with suppositories compared with oral mesalazine, both at two-week and four-week visits (mean disease activity index scores at baseline, two, and four weeks: suppositories = 7.7, 2.59, and 1.48; tablets = 7.42, 5.72, and 3.48, respectively (p < 0.001)). at the end of the study 5-asa suppositories showed significantly better results in all the

reduced social morbidity and severity of post-concussion symptoms in trial group patients at six months after head injury. at 1-year follow-up, there was no significant difference between patients who had received the intensive in-hospital cognitive rehabilitation program vs the limited home rehabilitation program in return to employment (90% vs 94%, respectively; p=.51; difference, 4% no statistical differences were found between the intervention and control groups. the treated group improved in terms of socialization and self-esteem as evidenced by a lower sickness impact profile, whereas the controls tended to get worse. improvement was greatest in those receiving intensive treatment, intermediate in those receiving conventional treatment, and least in those receiving no routine treatment. intense inpatient rehabilitation services for stroke survivors provide significantly more favorable functional and cognitive outcomes with relatively low complications than did nonintense rehabilitation efforts in home settings. there were no significant differences overall between the trial and control groups at follow up, but subgroup analysis of the patients with moderate or severe head injuries (posttraumatic amnesia > or = one hour, or admitted to hospital), showed that those in the early intervention group had significantly fewer difficulties with everyday activities (p = 0.03). the comparison group, despite initial lower injury severity and shorter hospital stay, did not demonstrate equivalent gains or any posttreatment effect. the different intensities of therapy employed in this study showed no evidence of a 'ceiling' effect and the 'intervention group' made significantly more rapid progress on tests of dependency during the period of admission. there were no significant differences between the groups on any of the four assessments. the groups generally improved a similar amount and did not differ from each other on any symptom-related, functional, or vocational variables 3-4 months after their baseline session. there were significantly more patients in the high intensity group than in the control group who achieved a maximum fim total score at the third month (47% vs. 19%, p = 0.015) and a maximum glasgow outcome scale (gos) score at the second (28% vs. 8%, p = 0.034) and third months (34% vs. 14%, p = 0.044).

the same increase was observed for sbp and cbg. lng-oc decreased hdl(2)-c and increased hdl(3)-c; hdl-c was unchanged and ldl-c decreased transiently. hemostatic activity was increased in both groups but a counteracting increase in fibrinolytic activity occurred together with an increase in coagulatory activity. high-density lipoprotein (hdl) cholesterol (p=.02) and triglycerides (p=.02 and p=.01) increased in both groups, but hdl/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (p=.02), apoprotein a1 (apo-a1) (p=.04) and apo-a1/apoprotein b (p=.048) increased significantly only with ee/cma. the glucose-induced suppression of plasma glucagon levels seemed less effective for treatment with the desogestrel-containing preparations than with the levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives. the insulin response, measured in 48 treated and eight control subjects, also increased over 12 months in both treated groups, but the total insulin area was within the range of the reference laboratory. there was a significant increase in the area under the curve for both glucose and insulin during ogtt within each group with increasing duration of use. dmpa and net-en caused significant changes in mean blood glucose and pyruvate and in mean serum insulin, growth hormone and glucagon, but not in mean fasting cortisol. at the end of treatment, no difference was found within or between groups in fasting glucose and insulin levels and in glucose rate of disappearance. the mean levels of fasting insulin and c-peptide underwent comparable increases in both regimens, suggesting a similar readjustment of glucose metabolism via slightly increased insulin secretion. thyroid stimulating hormone levels increased significantly more in the ring group at cycle 3 (p = 0.0016) but free thyroxine levels were unchanged in both groups. we found that serum resistin level remained unchanged in women receiving ethinylestradiol/desogestrel and was reduced in women treated with formulations containing gestodene. at the end of 6 months, there were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to plasma cholesterol, lipoproteins including hdl subfractions, triglycerides or glucose concentration. mean ± sd prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 and d-dimer levels remained essentially unchanged in the e(2)v/dng group (-0.6% ± 30.3% and -2.1% ± 43.5%, respectively), but increased in the ee/lng group (by 117.3% ± 358.0% and 62.9% ± 99.5%, respectively). there was a significant increase in bfg during the study and the values were still rising, when examined 2 months after discontinuation of the pill. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> subjects were healthy lean young women, needing a hormonal contraceptive singaporean women 78 participants (mean age 27.8 years healthy women aged 18-40 years 121 healthy women, 18-50 years of age 60 women, before and after 6 months of treatment twenty-eight young healthy women 167 women for 1 to 4 cycles of treatment germany over seven cycles, healthy women aged 18-50 years received seven who collaborating centres for research in human reproduction a total of 847 subjects 124 healthy women 195 women using an iud served as a comparison group normal-weight women forty-nine women participated 155 healthy women thirteen patients received forty-two women completed the study one hundred thirty women women who used oral contraceptives containing 59 women treated with healthy women chinese women sixty-five women fifty-three women were enrolled in the study 66 healthy women using phasic formulations of ocs containing either dsg (dsg-oc) or lng (lng-oc 71 normal-weight and 38 obese women initiating the oc women taking combined oral contraceptives containing 357 volunteers from four centers (hangzhou, havana, jakarta, and shanghai 38 normal women before and after 6 months' use of one of three new ethnic chinese women are presented thirty-six women fifty-seven women women <INPUT_END>

had a conspicuous beneficial effect on symptom frequency, symptoms during head up tilt, and quality of life. there was also no significant difference in the subgroups of patients who had had a mixed response and in those who had had an asystolic response during head-up tilt testing. this double-blind randomized trial of transdermal scopolamine demonstrated no significant effect of preventing vasovagal syncope. during the 1-year of follow-up, 20 patients of group a and 8 of group b had no recurrence. atropine was administered to 43 patients and was effective in 30 cases (69.7%, p<0.01 vs placebo). eight patients in gr 1 and six patients in gr 2 had mitral valve prolapse (p = 0.5). the differences in symptom reporting and mean sbp decrease after csm were both significant (p<.01 and p=.03, respectively). the likelihood of recurrent syncope was not significantly different between groups. all drugs improved the patients' well-being (anova: chi-square = 61.9, p < 0.0001). before administration of enalapril, plasma ca concentrations were significantly increased during hut compared with those in the supine position; in contrast, administration of the enalapril (10 mg/day) for >1 year inhibited the concentration of plasma ca increase and prevented syncope in all 12 patients (p < 0.05); however, placebo had no effect on plasma ca concentrations and syncope disappeared in only two of 12 patients after administration of placebo. during follow-up spontaneous syncope was reported in six patients (17.6%) in the paroxetine group as compared to 18 patients (52.9%) in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). oral etilefrine (10 mg three times a day) was not superior to placebo in preventing a positive response to head-up tilt testing. no significant differences in acute tilt-induced syncope recurrence rates were obtained among groups at test repetition since 70.2% of group a, 69.6% of group b and 62.5% of group c experienced syncope. intravenous metoprolol was found to be significantly more effective than placebo in preventing head-up tilt-table induced neurally mediated syncope. the pacemakers prevented bradycardia but had no effect on the time to syncope in a progressive test of head-up tilt followed by the addition of graded lower body suction. in this double-blind randomized trial, pacing therapy did not reduce the risk of recurrent syncope in patients with vasovagal syncope. during an average follow up of 15 (3) months there was a significant reduction in the recurrence of symptoms compared with the previous year in patients who had tilt up guided treatment (18 metoprolol, 1 clonidine). 11 patients developed profound hypotension during upright carotid sinus massage while pacing vvi compared with only two while pacing ddi. at 12 months, the rate of syncope in the np group was 40% (n = 12) compared with 10% (n = 3) in the p group (p = 0.008). vasovagal syncope was induced in 24 patients during hut alone, and in 30 patients during the hut with isoproterenol. the 41 patients programmed to cls had a mean follow-up of 19+/-4 months: none reported vvs, only four (10%) reported occasional presyncope and their quality of life greatly improved. one patient had to discontinue taking midodrine due to severe side effects and another six patients experienced minor side effects that did not require drug discontinuation. no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups with respect to recurrence of syncope (p=0.47). of the 15 patients initially given metoprolol, 2 (13.3%) did not respond; both were crossed over to verapamil, to which they remained unresponsive. syncope recurred in 16 patients (57%) of the nopacing group (mean follow-up 36 +/- syncopal events were also reduced during the follow-up period, but there were much fewer syncopal events than falls-28 episodes in paced patients and 47 in controls. dual-chamber pacing with rate-drop response reduces the likelihood of syncope in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. among the remaining 94, no difference between groups was observed regarding the distribution of time of vasovagal events (syncopes or presyncopes) during follow-up (log-rank test). the primary hypothesis was that atenolol is not superior to placebo for the treatment of vasovagal syncope. the head-up tilt test performed 1 month after pacemaker implantation was positive in 3 of 12 patients (25%) with ddd pacing with rate drop response function and in 5 of 8 patients (62.5%) with ddi pacing with rate hysteresis. qol was similar in the two pacing modes. svri was inversely associated with fractional increase in plasma adrenaline during both phases. ddd pacing with rate-drop response function is more effective than beta-blockade for the prevention of syncopal recurrences in highly symptomatic vasovagal fainters with relative bradycardia during tilt-induced syncope. during follow-up, the group treated with etilefrine had a similar incidence of first syncopal recurrence to that of placebo group both in the intention-to-treat analysis (24% versus 24%) and in on- treatment analysis (26% versus 24%). at baseline, the randomized patient groups were similar in their demographic and health characteristics and in the results of their atp tests, for example the mean cardiac pause (21.4 +/- 14 mmhg) and a higher prevalence of symptomatic pacemaker effect (50% vs 0%), of ventriculo-atrial conduction (78% vs 44%) and of orthostatic hypotension (50% vs 11%), while the entity of the systolic pressure fall caused by carotid sinus massage was similar in the two groups either during vvi mode (group a -51 +/- thus, the outcome of either treated or untreated patients was favorable (with a low recurrence rate of syncope), and the usefulness of tilting-guided medical therapy remains uncertain. intravenous disopyramide was ineffective for the prevention of neurally mediated syncope provoked by head-up tilt testing. there was no advantage with high rate intervention in delaying the loss of consciousness (or intolerable symptoms) after the initial onset of symptoms. one patient (5%) in the pacemaker arm experienced recurrence of syncope compared with 14 patients (61%) in the no-pacemaker arm (p=0.0006). the responses to head-up tilt were significantly different on the midodrine and the placebo day: on the placebo day, 67% (8/12) of the subjects suffered neurally mediated syncope, whereas only 17% (2/12) of the subjects developed neurally mediated syncope on the midodrine day (p < 0.02). <INPUT_END>

parent-reported conduct problems than the 40 children who completed treatment. improvement rate without cure during treatment was higher for the children treated with imipramine than for those treated with the detector, but at follow-up the reverse was true. uristop, a commercially available alarm device based on a theory somewhat different from those used in the common alarm devices, was tried in a prospective randomized double-blind study. the patients in group 2, who were older, had a higher rate of cure than did the patients in group 1. results indicated a significantly higher rate of

2 weeks of observation than placebo and alarm (4.1 +/- 0.4, p less than 0.05). in nonresponders the cumulative response after desmopressin treatment increased to 80% and 62% respectively. both procedures were equally effective, and in the total sample a better response to treatment was predicted by the child's report of being teased by siblings. at the end of treatment there was a significant difference in the mean number of dry nights per week between the two groups (6.3 in the alarm and desmopressin group and 4.8 in the alarm group) and also in the number of children becoming reliably dry. a significantly greater reduction in the number of wet nights was observed after the first 3 weeks of treatment in group 1. desmopressin offers better short-term results than enuresis alarm but the latter is significantly more efficient in the long term. although remission rates were similar, children treated with desmopressin had significantly more dry nights during treatment than those in the placebo group. the wetting frequency decreased during treatment by 46%, 52%, and 73% in groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. the success rate of arousal training was still significantly higher (92% continent) when compared to the urine device with specific instructions (77%) and urine alarm only (72%). similar rates of success were achieved for 47 children, aged 6 to 12 years, who partially or totally completed the 3-month period of alarm use. the enuresis tolerance scale was found to be a highly significant predictor of early termination from conditioning treatment. two studies examined the effectiveness of the body-worn alarm in out-patient treatment of childhood nocturnal enuresis. significant improvements in the p-h scale (p = 0.04) and three of its subscales

significantly (p < 0.01) greater than those of placebo. tazarotene cream and tretinoin cream significantly improved mottled hyperpigmentation and fine wrinkles. treatment response increased throughout the 36-week treatment period and the overall appearance of photodamaged skin was significantly better than with the vehicle alone. the degree to which the wrinkle score improved after laser treatment compared with that after dermabrasion was not statistically significant (p =.216). after one month of treatment the patients treated with tretinoin had significant lightening of hyperpigmented lesions as compared with the patients who received vehicle (p less than 0.002). both dermabrasion and carbon dioxide laser resurfacing are effective in the treatment of perioral rhytides. laser wavelength/pulse duration options and new techniques continue to shorten the healing phase associated with laser skin resurfacing while maintaining clinical efficacy. tretinoin-treated forearms showed significantly greater improvement in roughness, mottled hyperpigmentation, fine wrinkling, and lentigines at 24 and 48 weeks. both co2 and er:yag laser-treated sites showed overall modest wrinkle improvement compared to the pretreatment photographs. clinical examinations after 45 and 90 days' treatment showed significant improvements in skin condition in the actively treated group but not in the placebo group (p less than 0.001). clinical assessment demonstrated significant improvement with active treatment greater than control for fine wrinkling, tactile roughness, coarse rhytids, skin laxity/tone, sallowness/yellowing, and overall features. l-lactic acid cream was significantly superior to the vehicle in reducing the overall severity of photodamage (p < .05), mottled hyperpigmentation (p < .05), sallowness (p < .05), and roughness on the forearms (p < .05) at week 22. the addition of the er:yag laser following co2 laser resurfacing reduces the duration of crusting, swelling, and itching postoperatively. the laser treatment had a significantly higher erythema score at 1 month and a small but significantly greater improvement in perioral wrinkles at 6 months. posttreatment erythema was noted at 2 weeks in 14 subjects (67%) on the er:yag laser-treated side and 20 subjects (95%) on the co2 laser-treated side. ninety percent (9/10) of patients felt that overall they noticed significant improvement, however, there was no distinction between the two treatment options. it was more efficacious than vehicle in reducing skin roughness and fine wrinkling based on objective measurements. before and after treatment, we assessed histologic features, keratinocyte expression of hla-dr and intercellular adhesion molecule-1, numbers of epidermal langerhans' cells and epidermal and dermal t lymphocytes, and vascularity as measured by dermal endothelial cell area. mild to moderate skin reactions, such as erythema, peeling, and burning, were the most common side effects and, although most prevalent in the group using the 0.05% concentration, generally did not limit tretinoin use. treatment of upper lip wrinkles with baker's phenol resulted in greater improvement than treatment with the 950 microsec dwell time co2 laser. significant reductions were found in fine wrinkling, mottled hyperpigmentation, roughness, and laxity after 0.05% tretinoin therapy when compared with controls. improvement in overall severity of photodamage was significantly greater for tretinoin treated subjects and was progressive over the study period. overall there were trends towards greater improvement or less worsening in the glycolic acid group for all clinical assessments for photoaging. all 30 patients who completed the study showed statistically significant improvement in photoaging on the tretinoin-treated forearms, but not on the vehicle-treated forearms. results indicate statistically significant improvement in fine wrinkling, coarse wrinkling, and yellowing with the use of tretinoin cream 0.02% at week-24 end point, compared with placebo. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> 28 patients with facial lesions

protocols. because pregnancy rates and ongoing pregnancy rates were similar with and without estrogen supplementation (50.0% vs. 55.2% and 36.6% vs. 34.4%, respectively), we concluded that luteal estrogen supplementation in fixed multidose gnrh antagonist cycles did not change the pregnancy rates significantly. extending gnrha treatment through the luteal phase appeared not to have a significant impact on pregnancy or implantation rates in intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles. im significantly decreased e2/p ratio (p < 0.05). the overall pregnancy rate and miscarriage rate were comparable among the three groups. the luteal phase was significantly shorter in groups b, c and d, whereas group e was comparable with group a, 13.5 and 13.0 days, respectively. estradiol supplementation during the luteal phase in women undergoing ivf/icsi-et has a beneficial effect on the outcome without (at least, as seems from this study) having any adverse effects. these progesterone regimes produced no significant differences. bleeding episodes were 15.9% in group a compared with 20.8% in group b (or = 0.72; 95% ci = 0.38-1.36). pregnancy rates, ongoing/delivered, failed pregnancy rates, and product satisfaction scores for patients supplemented with crinone vaginal gel and with imp. p resulted in a higher percentage of pregnancies than the vaginal preparation, with statistically significant differences. significantly (p<0.05), more patients given dydrogesterone than micronised progesterone were satisfied with the tolerability of their treatment. the implantation rate per embryo was significantly higher in the im group (40.9%) than in the oral group (18.1%). hormonal levels did not differ between groups. following low dose vaginal treatment, a significantly higher implantation rate (30.7 versus 10.7%, p < 0.01), but similar clinical pregnancy rate (47.0 versus 33.3%) and ongoing pregnancy rate (41.1 versus 20.0%) was observed, compared with oral treatment. there was no difference between the groups in pregnancy rate, rate of spontaneous abortion, proportion of normally developing fetuses or rate of chemical pregnancy. in 148 out of 288 cycles, the luteal phase was supported only by vaginal micronized progesterone (group i). pregnancy rate in women with low late-midluteal estradiol levels was significantly lower compared to that with medium (100-500 pg/ml) and high (> 500 pg/ml) levels (13.3, 26.8, and 36.3%, respectively). administration of 0.1 mg of gnrh agonist triptorelin on day 6 after icsi led to a significant improvement of implantation and live birth rates after icsi as compared with placebo. safety parameters were similar in both groups, except for drowsiness, which was more significantly frequent in the oral progesterone group than in the crinone group at all time points. when the two groups were compared, there were also statistically significant differences in multiple pregnancy and live birth rates ( p < 0.05). gnrh agonist administration in the luteal phase was reported to beneficially affect the clinical outcome of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (icsi) and embryo transfer (et) cycles. the pregnancy rate was 21.6 versus 15.0% per transfer cycle with dydrogesterone or placebo, respectively. the ongoing pregnancy rate per transfer cycle was significantly better with hcg (18.7 versus 9.3). they did not differ in terms of e2 or p levels, endometrial thickness on the day of hcg, number of follicles > 16 mm in diameter, mature oocytes retrieved, or embryos transferred. despite higher embryo quality in group 1 than in group 2 (60.3 vs. 51.6), clinical (63.0% vs. 62.7%) and ongoing (58.7% vs. 51.0%) pregnancy rates (pr) were not significantly different. twenty-six ongoing pregnancies were achieved in the progesterone (26%) and 30 in the progesterone/e2 group (29.7%). the rate of positive beta-human chorionic gonadotrophin per transfer was 38.4% with imp, 35.0% with vpg once daily and 43.1% with vpg twice daily. similar levels of luteal e2 were documented in groups b and c. p levels were similar in the three groups. ongoing pregnancy rates were 25.2% in the utrogest 200 group and 22.2% in the crinone 8% group when patients were analyzed who normally completed the trial. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> ivf-icsi patients normal responder ivf patients

cesarean delivery with intrathecal sufentanil-morphine. neonatal outcome was similar in the two groups and all the neonates had apgar scores > or = 8 at one and five minutes. both dexamethasone and droperidol significantly decreased the total incidence of nausea and vomiting compared with saline, with incidences of 18, 21 and 51% for the three treatments respectively (p<0.01 and p<0.05 respectively). parturients who received dexamethasone, either 10 mg or 5 mg were different from those who received saline alone in the following parameters: the total incidence of nausea and vomiting, incidence of > 4 vomiting episodes, number the of parturients requiring rescue antiemetics, and the total number of parturients with no vomiting and/or no antiemetic medication (p < 0.05 to p < 0.01). patients in the group receiving metoclopramide had a significantly lower incidence of nausea and vomiting both before and after delivery than the control group (14% versus 81% overall). intraoperative nausea was decreased in the it fentanyl group compared with the iv ondansetron group: the median (interquartile range) difference in nausea scores was 1 (1, 2), p = 0.03. no differences were found between the groups in terms of severity or incidence of pain, or requests for analgesic or antipruritic medication. incidence rates for intraoperative nausea were 64% (acupressure group) and 71% (control group) (p = 0.416), with an incidence of intraoperative vomiting of 22% (acupressure group) and 27% (control group) (p = 0.506). patients in group o required significantly less vasopressor (p=0.009) and had significantly lower incidences of nausea and vomiting (p=0.049). there was also no difference between the two groups in nausea scores, number of vomiting episodes, or patient satisfaction with postoperative nausea and vomiting management. however, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in the patient's perception of the control of nausea and their overall satisfaction. the greatest reduction in emesis in the scopolamine group when compared with placebo was in the 6-24 h time period. the incidence of nausea and vomiting within 6 h postoperatively was lower and incidence of no nausea and vomiting for 24 h postoperatively was significantly higher for the combination group compared to the placebo group and the dexamethasone only group. droperidol reduced nausea and vomiting but did not prevent itching, and that epidural droperidol failed to prevent all side effects. the incidence of vomiting was lower following ondansetron (36%) compared with the control group (58%, p < 0.028). maximum analog sedation score was higher in group m compared to groups o and p (p < 0.05). patients in the group pretreated with glycopyrrolate reported a reduction in the frequency (p = 0.02) and severity (p = 0.03) of nausea. the use of acupressure reduced the incidence of nausea or vomiting from 53% to 23% compared with placebo (95% confidence interval (ci) 0.34-0.25; p = 0.002) during the operation and from 66% to 36% compared with placebo (95% ci 0.34-0.19; p = 0.003) after the operation. reduces the incidence of nausea

significant difference overall between the two groups in the incidence of intra- or postoperative nausea or vomiting/retching. control variables were similar in the two groups. the incidence of nausea, retching, and vomiting was significantly higher in the control group, compared to the propofol and midazolam groups. the administration of supplemental oxygen from anesthetic induction until the end of the surgery did not reduce the incidence of intra- and postoperative nausea or vomiting in women undergoing cesarean section under subarachnoid block. there were no differences among groups in nausea/vomiting score, pain score, sedation score, or shivering score at 4, 8, and 24 h after surgery. the incidence of nausea and vomiting was significantly decreased from 43% and 27% in the control group, to 3% and 0% in the acupressure group, respectively (p < 0.05). acupressure is an effective, non-pharmacologic method to reduce intraoperative nausea during elective cesarean section in the awake patient. no extrapyramidal symptoms or significant changes in pulse rate or blood pressure were associated with droperidol administration. this study showed a significantly lower incidence of nausea and vomiting and a tendency toward less severe emetic symptoms in the ondansetron and the droperidol groups than in the placebo group, but the ondansetron group was not statistically different from the droperidol group. ondansetron was effective in reducing the incidence of nausea and vomiting in patients receiving intrathecal morphine for caesarean section. <INPUT_END>

dysentery, and respiratory illness and a lower prevalence of fever and cough than did the zn+vm group and a lower prevalence of cough than did the placebo group (p = 0.05). prolonged zinc supplementation resulted in an increase in lymphocyte and granulocyte zinc (p = 0.0001), and an increase in interleukin-2 production (p = 0.0001), decreased incidence of documented bacteriologically positive infections (p = 0.0026), decreased number of hospitalizations and decreased number of vaso-occlusive pain crisis (p = 0.0001). the baseline characteristics, attained weight or length at 10 mo, growth velocity, gross motor development, and morbidity did not differ significantly between groups, even after control for potentially confounding variables. the mean percentage of cd4+ t lymphocytes and median haemoglobin concentrations were also similar between the two groups after zinc supplementation. there were no pneumonia-related deaths in the zinc group, but ten in the placebo group (p=0.013). zinc supplementation was significantly associated with a reduced prevalence of diarrhoea (0.87, 0.79 to 0.95). weight-for-age z score was higher in the zn group than in the placebo and fe+zn groups, knee-heel length was higher in the zn and fe groups than in the placebo group, and the bsid psychomotor development index was higher in the fe group than in the placebo group. although energy intake was similar in both groups, the zinc-supplemented infants had significantly higher linear growth gain, and their immune function improved as demonstrated by conversion of their delayed hypersensitivity skin reactions, enhanced lymphoproliferative response to pha, and increased salivary iga concentrations. zinc benefited the developmental quotient only in children who

experimental intervention was effective among patients who entered the trial with higher levels of symptom severity. there were highly significant improvements in symptoms, hrqol, mood and 'emotional bother' in 'full-pct' at 1 week, maintained over the 4-week follow-up. there was no difference between groups in the magnitude of change in global qol measures from baseline to any time point up to 9 weeks post-case conference, or at any time before death. pain problems later in the course of cancer seem to be predictable in those patients with higher scores on the cornell medical index m-r scales (greater emotional disturbance) and on the rotter locus of control at the end of the study, there were no differences in pain, mood disturbance, and concerns among the three groups. intervention patients were more likely to die at home rather than in a hospital or hospice (p=0.04), attended fewer consultations with a hospital doctor during the first 3 months (p=0.004), had fewer radiographs during the first 6 months (p=0.04), and had more radiotherapy within the first 3 months (p=0.01). there were no significant differences between the two arms with respect to changes in cancer needs, qol, or psychosocial functioning between the baseline and follow-up assessments, nor with respect to satisfaction with care. the experimental group reported significantly higher social support and lower disease uncertainty compared with the control group at 1 month after surgery and 3 months after diagnosis. no effects were found in relation to satisfaction with care, communication, or the discussion of patient problems. there were significant reductions in functional decline with inpatient geriatric evaluation and management and improvements in mental health with outpatient geriatric evaluation and management, with no increase in costs. a decrease in the incidence of pain described as more than life's usual aches and pains was found for the intervention group (p = .05). reductions in levels of anxiety, depression and perceived needs among intervention patients were not significantly different to control patients. the two groups did not differ in scores for psychosocial problems (uncertainty, anxiety, loneliness, disturbed sleep, loss of control, threat to self esteem), physical or psychological complaints, or in the coping strategies used. nurse-led early discharge had no adverse effects on quality of life or patient satisfaction, had little effect on carer burden, improved communication between primary and secondary care, reduced cancellations and was safely implemented in a mixed rural/urban setting. while the level of inadequacy in the control groups remained relatively stable at all assessment points, a slight increase in the percentage of patients being treated inadequately was found in the intervention group patients over time. the patient held record did not have an impact on communication but was significantly helpful to patients in preparing for appointments, reducing difficulties in monitoring their own progress, and helping them to feel more in control (p<0.05). the apn intervention resulted in significantly less uncertainty than the attention control intervention 6 months after surgery. a supplementary patient-held record for radiotherapy outpatients appears to have no effect on satisfaction with communication, participation in care, or quality of life. pain and nausea levels were measured at entry to trial and at one month, as were quality of life for patients and care givers' health. while no statistically significant improvements in patient satisfaction or gp confidence were shown, the data suggested that gps value contact to meet patient information needs. of women undergoing breast-conserving surgery, greater percentages in the case management group received adjuvant radiation (78.3% vs 44.8%; p=.001) and axillary dissection (71.4% vs 44.8%; patients with advanced disease were more likely than patients with non-advanced disease to report a continuing contact, and living in a rural district was positively associated with reporting a contact. findings included no differences in patient survival, activities of daily living (adl), cognitive functioning, or morale, but a significant increase in patient (p = .02) and caregiver (p = .005) satisfaction with care at one month. continued access to pain related information using either a patient- or provider-initiated format did not affect long-term pain outcomes. further work is needed to determine why depression and mental health were affected yet physical health and symptoms did not differ between groups. 554 patients expected to survive less than one year entered the trial and were randomly allocated to a coordination or a control group. the structured information pack improved gp knowledge of oncology; gps found themselves better equipped to support and counsel patients during the course of their illness, and practitioner satisfaction with the department rose. the results failed to show a significant beneficial effect of the intervention on pain control, sleep, cancer-related symptoms, or analgesic dosing, but confidence intervals were broad. unmarried women and women with no family history of breast cancer benefited from nurse interventions in mood states and well-being. patients in the augmented group improved significantly over the control group in ratings of pain intensity at its worst, whereas patients in the basic group had better ratings of pain intensity on average. during the initial 4 months of follow-up, the compliance was good (72%) and comparable among treatment groups. patients in the intervention arm experienced long-term improvements in quality-of-life outcomes related to sexual functioning and cancer worry compared with patients who received standard care. the cards did not impact on the utilization of the primary health care team and women in the intervention group were no more likely to utilize primary care sources of information than women in the non-intervention group. furthermore, in the general practice group there was a significant increase in satisfaction over baseline; a similar significant increase in satisfaction over baseline was not found in the hospital group. patients in the intervention and attention-control groups had better hrql than the control group (p =.006 and p =.01, respectively), but the intervention and attention-control groups were not significantly different (p =.80). there were no significant differences in other symptoms or quality of life between the two treatment groups. after 3 weeks, the average and worst pain experienced by patients randomized to the clinical intervention group was significantly inferior to the average pain experienced by patients in the control group (2.9/10 vs. 4.4/10 and 4.2/10 vs. 5.5/10, respectively). overall, the specialized home care intervention group was found to have increased survival (p = .002 using stratified log-rank test). gps receiving the ct sheet found correspondence significantly more useful (p < .001) and instructive (p < .001) than gps who received standard correspondence alone. telenursing participants believed that telenursing made care more accessible; they preferred telemedicine rather than waiting for face-to-face visits but still believed that face-to-face visits were best. analysis of variance revealed no differences in the physical well-being dimension of health-related quality of life between patients who received telephone follow-up and a control group who did not. at 12 and 24 months there were no differences in scores for quality of life (physical component score, p=0.88 at 12 months; p=0.28 at 24 months: mental component score, p=0.51, p=0.47; adjusted), anxiety (p=0.72; p=0.11) depression (p=0.28; p=0.80) or patient satisfaction (p=0.06, 24 months). no statistically significant differences were found in patients' experienced continuity between the trial arms, but important trends were seen in measures of needs for care in favour of those receiving the intervention. participants in both groups completed the symptom distress scale, brief fatigue inventory, and functional assessment of cancer therapy scale-general version 4 at eight intervals over six months. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> newly

the sc group had reduced handicap; but the control group showed no improvement. vestibular exercises are effective in reducing the duration of symptoms and the need of medication of patients in the early stages of peripheral vestibular disorders. odds ratios for improvement in treated patients relative to untreated patients were 3.1:1 at six weeks (95% ci = 1.4-6.8) and 3.8:1 at six months (95% ci = 1.6-8.7). vestibular rehabilitation delivered by nurses in general practice improves symptoms, postural stability, and dizziness-related handicap in patients with chronic dizziness. the use of exercises in the treatment of patients with vestibular deficits has become increasingly popular, and evidence exists that these exercises are beneficial in patients with chronic vestibular deficits. patients with positional and/or movement-related dizziness and abnormal posturography were randomly assigned to the three treatment groups. group a (6 weeks of vr) significantly (p < 0.01) increased their gait velocity and stability compared with group b (6 weeks of strengthening exercise), but there was a smaller difference (p = 0.05) between groups at 12 weeks, when both had had vr; there were no group differences at 1 year. for many patients a simple home program of vestibular habituation head movement exercises is related to reduction in symptoms and increasing independence in activities of daily living. however, older subjects receiving vestibular rehabilitation performed significantly (p<0.05) better on standing balance, timed up and go test and tandem gait, when compared with the older group that received only general instructions. although normalization of ot and svv was similar in the control and physiotherapy groups, the total sp values on day 30 after symptom onset differed significantly: 3.2 +/- the greatest difference in the rehabilitated subjects, compared with the control group, was for the dynamic gait index test; however, this difference was not statistically significant. multilevel analyses showed that vertigo decreased significantly after lm, crp, and brandt-daroff exercise; those three groups did not differ significantly. at the one-week follow-up, similar cure rates were obtained with the semont and epley maneuver (74% and 71% respectively), both cure rates being significantly higher than that obtained with brandt & daroff exercises (24%). vor on the unoperated side returned to normal values but on the lesioned side did not. balance performance was assessed by measuring the peak-to-peak magnitude and total amount of anterior-posterior body sway, and of horizontal (shear) ground reaction force during six test conditions, in which visual and somatosensory orientation cues were reduced or altered by rotation of the visual surround or support surface in proportion to the subject's sway, and in which vision was eliminated (eyes closed). as a group, patients who performed vestibular exercises showed a significant improvement in dva-predictable (p<.001) and dva-unpredictable (p<.001), while those performing placebo exercises did not (p =.07). the results from this study did not show tns to be superior to ar in reducing tinnitus, dizziness or increasing hearing ability. there were significant differences between groups regarding the change in the mean scores of the vdi (p = .001) and the vss (p = .001) at the end of the study in favour of the exercise group. a statistically significant improvement for visual vertigo symptom scores was noted only for group s (p < 0.01; total improvement 53.5 %). the sm was effective in 80% of the patients at 15 days of treatment versus 45% of those receiving only vre. rehabilitation therapy is proved to be effective in reducing disability in patients with persistent symptoms of disequilibrium after acute unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit. compared with the control group, subjects in the experimental group demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in single leg stance with eyes closed at the two-week assessment (p<0.05). a multiple comparison of the overall outcome measures showed no significant differences in group performance over an 8-week period. significant improvements were seen in symptom, disability, balance, and postural stability in chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction after an exercise program. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> unilateral vestibular hypofunction patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (bppv twenty-one patients with unilateral vestibular hypofunction, aged 20 to 86 years patients following acute onset of vestibular disturbance acute vertigo twenty-four subjects outpatient clinic of a university hospital forty patients with the clinical and electronystagmographic diagnosis of bppv benign paroxysmal postural vertigo twenty-six subjects with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo involving the unilateral posterior semicircular canal unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit patients with positional and/or movement-related dizziness and abnormal posturography after vestibular neuritis fifty-three patients after surgery 19 patients with and 20 patients without vestibular exercises dizziness and vertigo in primary care 106 bppv patients patients with persistent symptoms of disequilibrium after acute unilateral peripheral vestibular deficit 20 general practices in southern england patients with chronic unilateral vestibular dysfunction adults consulting their general practitioner (gp) with dizziness or vertigo dizzy patients after recent acute vestibular disturbance older subjects receiving benign paroxysmal vertigo benign paraoxysmal postural vertigo (bppv forty patients recently hospitalised for an acute episode of rotational vertigo which lasted days patients with chronic vestibular symptoms patients with recent unilateral vestibular disorders 18 years old) with unilateral (n = 51) or bilateral (n = 73) vestibular hypofunction, of whom 86 completed a 12-week intervention ménière disease patients with vestibular deficits 28 patients, using static posturography and.the dizziness handicap inventory short form patients with chronic peripheral vestibular dysfunction 20 patients diagnosed with menière's disease, transcutaneous nerve stimulation (tns) and applied relaxation (ar chronic dizziness 170 adult patients with chronic dizziness thirty-eight patients (10 males, 28 females;

terlipressin. mean arterial pressure, cardiac index, stroke volume index, and left ventricular stroke work index were significantly higher in avp patients. splanchnic blood flow and vo2 (p < .05) were increased in septic shock during hypotension and during vasopressor therapy. mean arterial blood pressure significantly increased (p < 0.001) and norepinephrine requirements significantly decreased (p < 0.001) in the avp/norepinephrine group. in patients with hyperdynamic septic shock, both norepinephrine and terlipressin were effective to raise mean arterial blood pressure. there were no significant differences with respect to organ failure-free days (22 vs. 25.5 days; p = 0.11), ventilator-free days (16.5 23 days; p = 0.15), length of stay (8 vs. 8.5 days; p = 0.93), or adverse event

maximum and minimum values of blood pressure and heart rate, and the time spent with systolic arterial blood pressure below 90 mmhg and above 160 mmhg, were used as indices of hemodynamic stability. there were no differences among groups in terms of systemic and regional hemodynamics. although oxygen delivery and oxygen consumption increased in both groups of patients, the phi increased significantly in those patients treated with norepinephrine whereas the phi decreased significantly in those patients receiving dopamine (p < .001, for corrected 3-hour value). no statistical

patients (42 vs 11%, p = 0.06). leukopenia was more common in the ganciclovir group (p<0.05), but in no case did it require drug discontinuation. significantly fewer patients in the 200-day group versus the 100-day group developed confirmed cmv disease up to month 12 posttransplant (16.1% vs. 36.8%; p < 0.0001). antiviral prophylaxis against cytomegalovirus has been associated with reduced risk of allograft rejection and improved allograft survival after renal transplantation. oral ganciclovir reduced the incidence of cmv infection (placebo 79 [51.5%] of 154; ganciclovir 37 [24.5%] of 150; p < 0.001) and also reduced symptomatic herpes-simplex infections (kaplan-meier estimates: placebo 36 [23.5%] of 154; ganciclovir five [3.5%] of 150; p < 0.001). this superior protection against cmv disease extends up to 1 year after transplantation and is not associated with ganciclovir resistance. the time to cmv disease was significantly prolonged in patients on acyclovir as compared to patients on placebo (p=0.013). no difference was observed between the two treatment groups with respect to detection of cmv dna, virus infections other than cmv, acute rejection episodes, and serum creatinine levels at 3 and 6 months following transplantation. there were no differences between the groups in the frequency of adverse events or in the rate of survival of either grafts or patients. the onst of cmv disease was not delayed significantly in acyclovir-treated patients compared with controls (acy, 47 +/- cmv disease developed in 23% of patients treated with acv and in 11% of patients treated with gcv + acv (p=0.03). there was also a trend for delayed acute rejection, and fewer opportunistic or other herpesvirus infections occurred in the valacyclovir group. significant reductions were observed with cmv infection (64% vs. 10%; p < 0.001) and disease severity (110 000 vs. 3200 copies/ml, p = 0.009) with extended treatment. the rate of ebv disease among patients treated with the combination regimen (eight [33%] of 24) was similar to that among patients treated with ganciclovir alone (five [21%] of 24; p = not significant). neither, the cmv status of donors and recipients nor the treatment for acute rejection had any significant impact on the occurrence of cmv infections. treatment with valacyclovir reduced the incidence or delayed the onset of cmv disease in both the seronegative patients (p<0.001) and the seropositive patients (p=0.03). from day 15 through day 60, the patients who took ganciclovir had significantly fewer urine cultures positive for cmv, but by day 90 there was no difference. cmv viremia during prophylaxis was significantly lower with valganciclovir (2.9% vs. 10.4%; p=0.001), but was comparable by 12 months (48.5% valganciclovir vs 48.8% ganciclovir). ganciclovir prophylaxis reduced the actuarial incidence of cytomegalovirus disease from 71% to 11% in cytomegalovirus-mismatched patients (p < 0.01). there was no significant difference between the two groups for age, immunosuppressive regimen, number of rejection, steroid pulses, and okt3 treatments. the incidence of cmv disease was significantly lower in the acyclovir group (5%) than in the control group (27%; p < 0.05). with respect to primary cmv infection, there was no difference in the rates in the 2 groups, but tissue invasive disease and recurrent cmv disease were less frequent in the ganciclovir group. oral and intravenous ganciclovir showed no significant difference to reduce the rate of cmv infection among high-risk kidney recipients. at termination of study enrollment, the cumulative incidence of all cmv infections (including seroconversions) was increased in group a compared with that in group g (75% versus 15%, p < 0.01), as was the incidence of overt cmv shedding and/or pneumonitis (50% versus 15%, p < 0.043). cmv disease occurred in 3 of 32 patients (9.3%) receiving oral ganciclovir and in 4 of 32 patients (12.5%) receiving iv ganciclovir within the first year after transplantation (p>0.2). cytomegalovirus was isolated from buffy-coat specimens from 17% of patients (11 of 64) receiving preemptive ganciclovir and from 35% of controls (17 of 49) (p = 0.03). the 12-month incidence of cmv disease was 67% in the def group compared with 6% in the gan group and 3% in the val group (p<0.001 gan or val vs. def; p=0.575 gan vs. val). no patients in the ganciclovir group, compared with 14 of 23 patients (61%) in the deferred-therapy group (p<0.0001), developed cmv disease during the first 12 weeks. prophylactic ganciclovir was associated with a lower incidence of serologically diagnosed secondary infection and the development of the igm anti-cmv antibody. there were no significant differences between the daily and 3-times-weekly groups with respect to survival free from cytomegalovirus infection or survival free from cytomegalovirus disease. infection rates for acyclovir vs. ganciclovir, respectively, stratified by cmv serology were: d+r-, 54 vs. 0%, p=0.0008; d+r+, 43 vs. 6.6%, p=0.01; d-r+, 8.3 vs. 0%, p=ns. preemptive ganciclovir therapy significantly reduced the incidence of cmv disease (p < .05) in cmv-seropositive

conversion to complete remission post-asct occurred in 30 and 14% of the amifostine and control groups, respectively (p=0.09). wbc toxicity (z=-0.604,p=0.546), neutrophilic granulocyte toxicity (z=-0.226,p=0.821), and platelet toxicity (z=-0.099,p=0.922) were compared; there was no statistic significance of difference (p >0.05); we found no differences regarding myelosuppression, infections or other chemotherapy complications. duration was significantly longer in b than in both a (p= .035) and c (p= .003). there was a significant reduction in the incidence of grade 3/4 mucositis (p < 0.0001), acute grade 2 xerostomia (p < 0.0001) and grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia (p = 0.012) in these patients who received a. in the zinc sulfate group, grade 3-4 mucositis was not detected in any patient; grade 0 mucositis was detected in 2, and grade 1 in 8, and grade 2 in 5 patients. the chinese herbal preparation yhd could alleviate oral mucomembranous reaction to radiation applied in patients with head-neck tumor. both study and control groups were compared with respect to the frequency [30% versus 36%, chi(2) exact test, not significant (ns)] and mean duration (4.8 +/- patients who received gm-csf had less mucosal pain (p = 0.058) and were less often prescribed opioids for pain (p = 0.042). in patients receiving less toxic regimens, a decrease in who grade 1-4 oral mucositis was noted in the gum arm compared with the standard arm (49% vs. 72%, p=0.03). the duration of objective oral mucositis > or = grade 1 (p = 0.0097), grade 2 (p = 0.0232), and grade 3 (p = 0.0168) was shorter in the glutamine arm. early during radiation therapy less oral pain was reported in the sucralfate group, but as treatment progressed all patients experienced pain. of 205 evaluable patients, 52.9% vs. 62.4% developed rtog grade 3 or greater mucositis after morning vs. afternoon rt, respectively (p = 0.17). one-year rates of locoregional failure, progression-free survival, and overall survival were not significantly different between treatments. in univariate and multivariate analysis, severe oral mucositis correlated with tbi in the conditioning regimen and lack of folinic acid rescue following mtx administration. subsequent mucositis was significantly reduced in the group assigned to receive cryotherapy as judged by the attending physicians (p = .0002) and by the patients themselves (p = .0001). we evaluated the efficacy of topically applied human recombinant epidermal growth factor (rhegf) for the treatment of oral mucositis induced by radiotherapy (rt), with or without chemotherapy, in patients with head and neck cancer. the duration of severe mucositis did not differ between pge and placebo groups (chi-square 0.95, p = ns). as compared with placebo, palifermin was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of grade 4 oral mucositis (20 percent vs. 62 percent, p<0.001), patient-reported soreness of the mouth and throat (area-under-the-curve score, 29.0 [range, 0 to 98] vs. 46.8 [range, 0 to 110]; p<0.001), the use of opioid analgesics (median, 212 mg of morphine equivalents [range, 0 to 9418] vs. 535 mg of morphine equivalents [range, 0 to 9418], p<0.001), and the incidence of use of total parenteral nutrition (31 percent vs. 55 percent, p<0.001). both cryotherapy groups had similar degrees of mucositis. the severity (maximum extent) of acute radiation therapy side effects was significantly less in enzyme-treated patients than in control patients: mucositis (mean: 1.3 vs 2.2, p < 0.001), skin reaction (1.2 vs 2.4, p < 0.001) and dysphagia (1.4 vs 2.2, p < 0.001). injection of 4000u sod immediately after receiving radiotherapy significantly reduced the occurrence rate of skin, oral mucosal, pelvic visceral and systematic adverse reaction, only the reduction of leukopenia did not reach the statistical significant level. during cycle 1, placebo-treated patients had more episodes of mucositis (47%) compared with those patients randomized to filgrastim (28%). amifostine significantly reduced the incidence of acute perineal skin and bladder toxicity (p <.0006). l-alanyl-l-glutamine patients experienced less pain (three highest numeric rating scale scores of 1.3/10 vs. 6.3/10 respectively, p = 0.008) and need for feeding tubes (14% vs. 60% respectively, p = 0.020) compared with placebo patients. g-csf therapy reduced both the incidence and duration of adm-induced oral mucositis, and a positive correlation was also seen between the incidence of mucositis and adm-induced leukopenia (< 2,000/mm3). a trend favouring shorter treatment interruptions in the prednisone arm was also found, but not a reduction in the intensity or duration of mucositis. the study demonstrated that the proportion of patients with severe mucosal reactions was significantly lower in the sucralfate group than in the placebo group. opioids than the control group. the results of the qol scales did not reveal any significant difference between the pilocarpine and placebo groups with regard to xerostomia and mucositis. comparing the time course of the mean scores for subjective intolerance, mucositis, dysphagia, dermatitis and nausea, no statistically significant differences between the two treatment arms (sucralfate, n = 38; placebo, n = 45) were observed. there was no significant difference between groups concerning the grades of mucositis on day 8 (p = 0.234) or on day 15 (p = 0.208). no significant difference was observed in hematologic toxicity, transfusion requirements, duration of fever, and hepatic toxicity between the treatment groups. the frequency of grade 2 to 4 mucositis was 43% in patients treated with kgf, compared with 67% in patients treated with placebo (p =.06). sfr has definite effect in preventing and treating radiation reaction and late stage radiation injury in patients with head and neck tumor. the distribution of grade 4 mucositis (who) was 1 case versus 8 cases, with and without amifostine, respectively. no statistically significant difference was found between the results with na sos and those with placebo for any of the variables, with the exception of skin desquamation, which showed a significant difference in the placebo group. remarkably, the hazard ratio (hr) for grades 2, 3, and 4 om was 0.41 (range, 0.22-0.75; p = .002) and for grades 3 and 4 it was 0.07 ( pilocarpine has no benefit for the moderation of the incidence, severity, or duration of mucositis in patients receiving autologous blood stem cell transplantation. however, there was significantly less mucositis (p < 0.01, analysis of variance) from weeks 3--6 in the 17 patients treated with misoprostol at loyola compared to the 18 placebo-treated patients. positive cultures for aerobic pathogenic bacteria were observed in 15 per cent of the treatment group and 65 per cent of the control group, during or after radiotherapy (p = 0.007). oral aloe vera did not improve tolerance to head-and-neck radiotherapy, decrease mucositis, reduce soreness, or otherwise improve patient well-being. local effectivity appeared to be less in the hypopharynx due to shorter time of application compared with mouth and oropharynx. the occurrence rate of grade 1-2 mucositis of the oral cavity was higher in trial group than in control group (73.68% vs. 62.50%), but the occurrence rate of grade 3-4 mucositis was lower in trial group than in control group (26.32% vs. 37.50%, p=0.470). no statistically significant difference for the objective and subjective mucositis scores was observed between the two study arms (p = 0.33). the safety and efficacy of 0.15% benzydamine oral rinse in preventing or decreasing erythema, ulceration, and pain associated with oral mucositis during rt were evaluated in a randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted in patients with head and neck carcinoma. no significant differences existed between the two mouthwashes in regard to incidence, days to onset, and severity of mucositis. prophylactic oral glutamine could ameliorate the neoadjuvant chemotherapy-induced increase in intestinal permeability, but had no significant positive clinical effect on stomatitis and diarrhea and did not interfere with the antitumor effect of chemotherapy. the severity of mucositis was reduced in the gm-csf arm (p<0.05). amifostine significantly reduced the mean questionnaire scores from 6.49 to 3.73, the incidence of grade > or = 2 mucositis from 75% to 36% and acute xerostomia from 82% to 39%. in the chlorhexidine-based group, a significant decrease of the aerobic (p=0.042) and anaerobic (p=0.008) bacterial flora was identified. the 650 nm wavelength reduced the severity of oral mucositis and pain scores. no difference in the visually assessed degree of mucositis or oral pain reported by the patients was found between the study and the control groups. there was significant reduction in the symptomatic grade 3/4 mucositis among honey-treated patients compared to controls; i.e. 20% versus 75% ( p 0.00058). we found no significant difference between the molgramostim and the control groups in the oral mucositis grade, oral pain, use of analgesic drugs, weight loss, or survival. benzydamine hydrochloride rinse was shown to prevent oral mucositis in radiation therapy. om occurred significantly more often in females than in males (86% vs 60%, p=0.0016) and was worse and of longer duration. the highest grade of mucositis during the treatment time was significantly different between two groups (p = 0.049). the prophylactic value of twice-daily mouth rinses with a solution of 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate in minimizing oral complications during remission-induction chemotherapy was tested in sixteen patients with acute myeloblastic leukemia. there was no difference in the frequency or severity of oral mucositis between the sucralfate- and the placebo-treated group. acute nausea/vomiting was frequently observed immediately during or after the application of amifostine despite intensive antiemetic prophylaxis consisting of 5-ht3-receptor antagonists/dexamethasone/trifluorpromazine. the frequency of grade 2 to 4 mucositis was 100% for patients in the placebo group, 64% for patients in the 25 microg/kg group (p = 0.041 versus placebo), and 50% for patients in the 50 microg/kg group (p = 0.006 versus placebo). a significant reduction in mucositis among honey-received patients compared with controls (p=0.000) occurred. patients in the control group developed grade 2 mucositis and dermatitis earlier and sooner than patients in the experimental group. evaluation of the data showed delayed mucositis in the experimental group for grades 1 to 3, with a significant difference at grade 3 compared with controls. their scores were also significantly lower when compared to the salt/soda and chlorhexidine groups from the fourth and fifth week, respectively, after radiotherapy. palifermin was associated with reduced incidence and mean severity of mucositis in patients conditioned with cy/tbi but not bu/cy. there were no substantial differences in mucositis attributable to the two mouthwashes in the patients who crossed-over on their second cycle of chemotherapy. there were no statistically significant differences between the arms in the extent of severe mucositis as measured by physician, in oral toxicities as recorded by patients, or in radiotherapy delays. there were no significant differences or substantial trends in the mucositis scores between the two study arms as measured by either the physicians or the patients. the mean total duration of mucositis was 2.75 weeks in treatment patients and 9.25 weeks in control patients. amifostine given subcutaneously did not improve the rates of xerostomia and mucositis with this fairly intensive chemoradiotherapy regimen. ip test score was significantly higher than those of the control group [6.78% (4.63, 10.66) vs. 2.17% (1.38, 2.40), p<0.001]. adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation and death did not differ significantly between groups. propantheline is effective in reducing the incidence and severity of mucositis in patients receiving high-dose etoposide. patients given sucralfate suspension were less likely than subjects receiving placebo to acquire colonization with potentially pathogenic microorganisms: 14 (58%) of 24 versus 22 (92%) of 24, respectively (p = 0.008). amifostine reduced grade > or =2 acute xerostomia from 78% to 51% (p<.0001) and chronic xerostomia grade > or = 2 from 57% to 34% (p=.002). there was a trend for more mucositis and there was substantially more toxicity (eg, mouthwash-induced discomfort, taste alteration, and teeth staining) on the chlorhexidine arm. -csf only improved the incidence of severe mucositis during the induction course (p = 0.003) and probably also improved the median duration of fever (p = 0.07). grade 3 mucositis was more common in patients receiving chemotherapy (p = 0.05) or bid fractionation (p = 0.04) or having a poor kps (p = 0.02). analysis of variance indicated significant direct gm-csf treatment effects on the mean auc of gross/functional scores and duration of moderate gross mucositis (grade > or = 2) over both periods. subset analysis did reveal unsuspected differential effects between males and females that could not be explained by reasons other than chance. duration of moderate/severe mucositis was, although not significantly, lower in the int group (17 days, s.d. = 12) than in the lim group (19 days, s.d. = 13). compared with placebo, palifermin reduced the cumulative incidence of moderate to severe (grade 2 or higher) mucositis (44% vs. 88%; p < 0.001; difference, -44 percentage points [95% ci, -71 to -16 percentage points) and severe (grade 3 or 4) mucositis (13% vs. 51%; p = 0.002; difference, -38 percentage points [ci, -67 to -9 percentage points]). concomitant reductions in total oral streptococci (p less than 0.02-p less than 0.001) and oral candida (p less than 0.004) were seen in patients using chlorhexidine. the incidence rates of mucositis, pain, xerostomia and taste disturbance were all markedly lower in polaprezinc group than in control. in previous studies oral glutamine was found to protect animals from the effects of whole abdominal radiation and methotrexate-induced enteritis. there was a reduction in mucositis distribution (p = 0.002), mucositis area (p = 0.028), dysphagia (p = 0.006) and weight loss (p = 0.009) in the active arm. there was no significant difference between the cohorts in stomatitis severity, incidence of uom, peak mouth pain, peak difficulty swallowing, amount of opiate analgesics used, or adverse event type or incidence. the benzydamine topical application was more effective than placebo in the control of mucositis symptoms and signs produced by radiotherapy and/or intra-arterial antineoplastic chemotherapy. for the maximum mucositis scores, no statistically significant differences were found between the placebo and the verum group. overall survival was significantly greater in the granulocyte-colony stimulating factor arm (hazard ratio, 0.37; p = 0.037). although the frequency of culture-positive herpes simplex virus was low in the untreated group, it was significantly lower, zero, in the acyclovir-treated group. fu dose reductions in the second chemotherapy cycle were more frequent in the placebo group (31%) than in the palifermin group (14%). patients in the sucralfate group experienced significantly lower degree of mucositis than placebo group (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine had no effects of any clinical significance on parameters such as number of days with fever, number of oral lesions, plaque score, gingival bleeding score, or occurrence of candidiasis. the incidences of grade iii-iv mucositis and infection were significantly reduced (p = 0.005, p = 0.001, respectively) and duration of hospitalization was modestly shortened by 1 day (p = 0.02) in rhgm-csf treated patients. the result showed a significant difference in pain and mucositis (p<0.001) between the two groups. colonisation index of candida species and gram-negative bacilli was reduced in the pta group and not in the placebo group (p<0.05). no differences were found in the median subjective pain scores, who scores, and oral assessment scores between the placebo and the gm-csf groups. we could not identify any significant difference in the incidence of severe mucositis based on whether patients were allocated to receive misoprostol or placebo. the trends of decreased median length of stay and the median number of days of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) were seen in the group supplemented with the >0.285-g/kg (the recommended dosage) dose of glutamine; however, there was no statistically significant difference in the nutritional status and overall patient outcome as assessed by days receiving tpn, number of days required until oral intake resumed, length of hospitalization, number of days and highest grade of mucositis, and quantity and number of days of diarrhea. in the control group, stomatitis occurred in 9 of the 10 patients receiving pf therapy and in all of the 5 receiving vac. the grades of mucositis were marginally higher in the evening-irradiated group than in the morning-irradiated group 38% vs. 26% (p = 0.08). mucositis was significantly reduced by cryotherapy considering both the first cycle of therapy (the mean toxicity score for cryotherapy was 0.59 and it was 1.1 for the control group, p < or = 0.05) and all the chemotherapeutic courses (the mean toxicity score for cryotherapy was 0.36 when it was 0.69 for the control group, p < or = 0.05). palifermin appeared to reduce mucositis, dysphagia, and xerostomia during hyperfractionated radiotherapy (n = 40) but not standard radiation therapy (n = 59). compared to the normal saline group, patients using cryotherapy experienced less grade 3-4 mucositis, 14 vs 74%, p=0.0005. patient preference favored sucralfate, but this preference failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.06). stomatitis worsened in only 7 patients (47%) in the traumeel s treatment group compared with 14 patients (93%) in the placebo group. visual analogue scale for oral pain and oral function was not significantly different between the two groups. assessment of the area under the curve revealed statistically significant reductions in om severity in the rhitf-treated groups versus placebo. the clinical trial showed that application of ir can reduce the severity of radiation mucositis (p = 0.01), anorexia (p = 0.002), and swallowing difficulty (p = 0.002). a 42% risk (15/36) of mucositis grade > or = 3 was evident on day 15 in patients receiving gm-csf compared to 2 of 9 patients on the placebo arm. amifostine provided reduction in acute xerostomia and mucositis but had no obvious influence on karnofsky performance status, body weight, cutaneous side effects, and alopecia. the treatment duration was significantly shorter in the amifostine-treated group (p = 0.013), because treatment interruptions were more frequent in the control group. the colonization index of viridans streptococci was significantly reduced only after 5 weeks of chlorhexidine 0.1% treatment. the supplement was well tolerated with no apparent adverse effects, but failed to have any significant effect on oral mucositis assessed by the patients or investigator. the gln-treated patients lost significantly less weight, tended to have shorter in-patient duration and had less severe oral mucositis than controls. oral enzymes act as a potent antiinflammatory, antiedematous agents thereby decreasing acute toxigenic effect of radiation and increasing compliance, quality of life of our patients. the analysis showed that the higher education level and the use of dentures significantly reduced the occurrence of mucositis, and allopurinol mouth rinse (1 mg/ml) was ineffective in the prophylaxis of fluorouracil-induced mucositis. our findings revealed that the patients in the e2 group not only had later onset of stomatitis than those in the control and the e1 groups, but also had lesser degree of oral injury measured by the overall assessment score. no statistically significant between-group differences were seen in mean worst scores across time using repeated measures analysis of variance (hickey, p = 0.231; who, p= 0.288). the main endpoint was severe mucositis that was more frequent in the placebo group than in the sucralfate group (47% vs. 29%, p = 0.07). <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> from july 1997 through june 1998, 17 patients

ic 95% = 2.03-18.67) and after (or = 2.14; ic 95% = 1.16-3.94). children with dental fluorosis were 1.75 times more likely to be free of caries (or = 1.75-ci:0.43, 6.68). from logistic regression, the prevalence of caries was significantly associated with age, dental attendance, and the use of a water supply fluoridated at 1.0 ppm. the prevalence of fluorosis among children in acorn group a-c was significantly greater than in groups d-f. the prevalence of fluorosis by tf1+ case definition declined from 34.7% to 22.1% and by tf2+ case definition from 17.9% to 8.3%. a very strong association was observed with inappropriate fluoride supplement use (or = 23.74, 95% ci 3.43-164.30). mean dmft values in perth and bunbury were 0.32 and 0.28 (p > 0.05). there was no statistically significant increased risk of dental fluorosis prevalence associated with any of the fluoride exposure risk factors examined, including reported usage of (1000 ppm) fluoride toothpaste from time of first deciduous tooth eruption. in bivariate analyses, mild fluorosis was significantly related to ingestion of fluoride dentifrice at ages 24 and 36 months (p = .02 for both). swallowed fluoride toothpaste in the early years of life has been postulated to be a risk factor for fluorosis, but the epidemiological evidence is weakened by the fact that most of the relevant studies were done in developed countries where an individual is exposed to multiple sources of fluoride. an odds ratio of 1.7 associated with infant formula use was suggestive of an increased risk of enamel fluorosis as was an odds ratio of 2.9 associated with fluoride dentifrice use. logistic regression established tooth brushing frequency and fluoride supplement use, in addition to tap water fluoride concentrations above 0.7 mg/l, as significant risk factors when the presence of fluorosis on at least one tooth was used as outcome variable. there was no association between behavior problems and dental fluorosis in this population. the child's birth weight and liking for or swallowing of toothpaste did not influence the prevalence of fluorosis. multivariate analysis indicated that area of residence (odds ratio = 4.5), jarman score (odds ratio = 0.99 per jarman unit) and type of toothpaste (odds ratio = 1.6) were statistically significantly related to presence or absence of fluorosis: the risk factors were--fluoridated area, affluence, and use of adult toothpaste. those who brushed their teeth before the age of 25 months had 11 times the odds of fluorosis compared with those beginning toothbrushing later; prolonged use of infant formula (greater than or equal to 13 months) was associated with 3.5 times the risk of fluorosis, compared with no, or shorter duration of, formula use. there was a strong association between mild-to-moderate fluorosis on later forming (fri classification ii) enamel surfaces and both supplement use (or = 7.97, 95% ci 2.98-21.33) and early toothbrushing habits (or = 4.23, 95% ci 1.72-10.41). the risk of fluorosis was significantly greater for children who had greater exposure to fluoridated water and who used larger amounts of fluoridated toothpaste up to age eight. <INPUT_END>  <population>￨<INPUT_START> maxillary central incisors of 325 consecutive children cases and non-cases were identified by the screening of 8-, 9-, and 10-year-old schoolchildren in the fluoridated community of east york, ontario pre-school children who were 2-years-old at the start of the 3-year trial children who began brushing with children < 6 years of age dental fluorosis in permanent incisor teeth in relation to water fluoridation, social deprivation and toothpaste use in infancy schoolchildren of campeche, mexico permanent teeth of canadian children infancy and fluorosis of permanent maxillary incisors at age 8-9 years children who used a low fluoride toothpaste between 2 and 5 years of age fluorosis risk in grade 2 students residing in a rural area with widely varying natural fluoride dental caries and fluorosis prevalence study in a nonfluoridated brazilian community 1189 seventh grade children with a mean age of 12.2 years south australian children mean age of weaning of those who had been breast-fed was 7.7 months;

release was similar in the two groups throughout (p > or = 0.12). htea showed improved physiotherapy cooperation (p < 0.001), arterial oxygen tension (p = 0.041), and peak expiratory flow rate (p = 0.001). no statistically significant differences between the 2 study groups were found in these main measurements. high tea was effective in all patients of this group, the somatosensory block extended from t1 through t7 vertebrae. more than 30 episodes of hypoxemia developed on the second night in 22% of patients (11 of 50 patients), and on the third night in 30% of patients (14 of 46 patients). there were no significant differences in cardiac index between the two groups of patients, although heart rate and mean arterial pressure decreased before surgery in patients who received extradural analgesia. this method of analgesia was also associated with minimal side effects and provides an alternate approach for treatment of pain after cardiac operations. the incidence of perioperative dysarrhythmias was significantly lower (p < .01) in the ga+tea group (3%) than in the ga group (23.7%). like il-10, opioids downregulate the immune responses in vivo and in vitro, including the activity of the cytokine-producing monocytes and granulocytes. mean troponin t levels at 24 h were not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.41). immunostaining intensity in the sections after incubation with each primary antibody increased in the ga + tea group compared with the ga group. in group e 22 of 44 (50%), in group e+a 10 of 35 (28.6%), in group a 10 of 36 (27.8%), and in the control group 20 of 48 (41.7%) patients developed af (odds ratio amiodarone/nonamiodarone 0.47 [0.24-0.90]; p = 0.02). preoperatively no intergroup differences were observed in "the starling forces" (coppl, copif, pif). thirty-day survival free from myocardial infarction, pulmonary complications, renal failure, and stroke was 85.2% in the tea group and 89.7% in the ga group (p = 0.23). there were no differences in postoperative spirometry or chest radiograph changes or in markers for postoperative myocardial ischemia or infarction. vas score, ss, and postoperative pao2 were significantly (p less than or equal to 0.01) better in the tea group. the increase in the plasma levels of bactericidal permeability-increasing protein, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, and c-reactive protein showed the same pattern in all groups, and no significant differences among the 4 groups were observed. extubation was achieved earlier (p < 0.0001) and with significantly fewer lower respiratory tract infections in group tea (tea = 31 of 206, ga = 59 of 202; p = 0.0007). during bypass svr and mean arterial pressure (map) were significantly higher and pump flow lower in the hf group compared to the lf+tea group. forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume in one second followed the same pattern for first four postoperative days and peak expiratory flow rate remained statistically high till second postoperative day. a 50-70% reduction in forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (fev1.0) and peak expiratory flow rate (pefr) was seen after surgery, but higher fev1.0 and pefr on days 2 and 3 were seen in the epidural group than in the control group. in the tea+ga group, the bcl-2 positive cardiomyocytes were distinctly statistically increased compared to the ga group (p<0.001). increases of pct, tnf-alpha and leukocyte count were significantly attenuated in the dpx and epi groups at different time points. pain score in the epidural group was lower on the first postoperative day than in the extubated group with general anesthesia (3.0 plus minus 1.6 visual analog scale v 4.6 plus minus 1.8 visual analog scale; p = 0.01). the gae, compared with ga, group reported significantly lower levels of impairment for all pain domains and reduced morphine usage (odds ratio = 0.07, 95% ci [0.03-0.17]; p < 0.001). on the first postoperative day, a slight reduction in paco2 was seen in the tea group, but no differences in shunt, va/q matching, or oxygenation compared with the ga group. time to extubation was shorter (p <

was considered as the gold standard method (r= 0.943; p= 0.000). both molecular assays are suitable for the detection of m. tuberculosis isolates in smear-positive pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens, while the sensitivity of the detection of m. tuberculosis isolates in smear-negative specimens was variable. based on culture as the gold standard, the overall sensitivity and specificity for all sample types for the xpert mtb/rif assay were 90.9 and 89%, respectively, while for the mtd assay, the overall sensitivity and specificity were 97.3 and 87.1%, respectively. in patients infected with hiv compared with patients uninfected with hiv xpert mtb/rif showed a trend to reduced sensitivity (p=0.09) and significantly reduced negative predictive value (p=0.01). sensitivity and specificity of mtbdr for detection of isoniazid resistance were 83.3% and 100%, respectively. global control of tuberculosis is hampered by slow, insensitive diagnostic methods, particularly for the detection of drug-resistant forms and in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. median time to detection of tuberculosis for the mtb/rif test was 0 days (iqr 0-1), compared with 1 day (0-1) for microscopy, 30 days (23-43) for solid culture, and 16 days (13-21) for liquid culture. the genexpert assay was highly effective for tuberculosis diagnosis and identification of rifampin-resistant strains in smear-negative samples. the sensitivity and specificity of pcr were respectively 100% and 100%, and 85.7% and 97.3% for respiratory and non-respiratory samples. the specificity for detecting m. tuberculosis was 92.0% (23/25) and for rmp resistance it was 100% (8/8). the genexpert mtb/rif assay is a novel integrated diagnostic device for the diagnosis of tuberculosis and rapid detection of rif resistance in clinical specimens. the xpert mtb/rif test has superior performance for rapid diagnosis of mycobacterium tuberculosis over existing afb smear microscopy and other molecular methodologies in an hiv- and tb-endemic region. the accuracy of the xpert mtb/rif assay for diagnosing tb and drug resistance was assessed in comparison with other

higher in patients treated with omeprazole 10 mg [32.3%, 95% confidence interval (ci), 22.9%-41.6%] or 20 mg (25.8%, 95% ci, 16.9%-34.7%) than in the placebo group (12.0%, 95% ci, 5.3%-18.6%). omeprazole significantly improved reflux score irrespective of h. pylori infection while famotidine significantly improved reflux score in h. pylori-positive patients but not in h. pylori-negative patients. compared with placebo, cisapride significantly reduced scores for daytime and nighttime heartburn (p < 0.001), total regurgitation (p < 0.001), eructation (p = 0.04), and early satiety (p = 0.04). patients in the esomeprazole group (n = 85) demonstrated statistically significant reductions in their gerdq index, from 19.45 to 15.37 and to 14.32 (p = 0.013, p = 0.005) at weeks 4 and 8, respectively. we conclude that omeprazole is superior to cimetidine for the relief of all grades of heartburn in gerd, whether or not the patient has unequivocal endoscopic oesophagitis. omeprazole was significantly (p< or =.003) more effective than placebo for the treatment of acid regurgitation, dysphagia, epigastric pain, and nausea. complete heartburn relief at week 4 was 32% with rabeprazole and 3.8% with placebo (p < or = .001). at 4 weeks the proportion of patients with complete absence of heartburn was 46% (95% confidence interval, 39-53%) with 20 mg omeprazole, 31% (25-38%) with 10 mg omeprazole, and 13% (7-20%) with placebo. lansoprazole therapy is more effective than standard dosages of ranitidine or placebo in relieving symptoms in patients with endoscopically confirmed non-erosive reflux esophagitis. significant (p less than 0.05) decreases in symptom frequency and severity were noted throughout the study in the cimetidine-treated patients, as compared with the placebo group. quality of life was improved in all treatment groups, and the improvement in the reflux dimension of the gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (gsrs) score was significantly different between groups (p = 0.002). patients with heartburn and normal endoscopy results or mild erosive changes received omeprazole 10 mg or 20 mg daily or ranitidine 150 mg twice daily for 2 weeks. endoscopic healing at 4 weeks occurred in 76% of oesophagitis patients on ome20 and in 56% on ome10. ranitidine was superior to placebo with regard to effect on symptoms, improvement of oesophagitis as assessed by endoscopy and biopsy, and decrease of oesophageal acid hypersensitivity. on completion, symptom relief favoured omeprazole: 57% of patients on omeprazole were free of heartburn (vs. 19% on placebo), 75% were free of regurgitation (47%) and 43% were completely asymptomatic (14%), each with p < 0.0001. at two weeks there was no significant difference between placebo and ranitidine, regarding the proportion of patients with complete relief from symptoms or satisfied with treatment. at two weeks cimetidine was significantly more effective than placebo. pantoprazole is significantly superior to ranitidine in the treatment of key and associated gastrointestinal symptoms of gerd and is well tolerated. there were no differences between the groups with respect to changes in esophageal mucosal sensitivity to acid perfusion or changes in histologic grading of esophageal mucosal biopsy specimens. proportions of patients with total heartburn relief were higher in patients with eo (71%-80% of patients from day 4 onwards) compared to those without eo (52%-67% of patients from day 4 onwards). dexlansoprazole mr 30 and 60 mg were superior to placebo in providing 24-h heartburn-free days and nights in nerd patients. pantoprazole was associated with significantly higher rates of complete control of gord symptoms than ranitidine at four weeks (40% v 19%; p < 0.001), eight weeks (55% v 33%; p < 0.001), six months (71% v 56%; p = 0.007) and 12 months (77% v 59%; p = 0.001). omeprazole 20 mg once daily was highly effective in relieving heartburn whereas cisapride 20 mg twice daily was not significantly more effective than placebo. the percentage of heartburn-free days was significantly higher with esomeprazole 40 mg (63%, 66%) or 20 mg (63%, 68%) than with placebo (46%, 36%; p < or = 0.001) in each of the two studies. there was a significant correlation between the ph registration result and response to omeprazole (p = 0.04, chi2), but not to placebo (p = 0.16). ranitidine-treated patients had more favorable scores on the general health status dimensions of physical functioning, bodily pain, and vitality (p < .05), and more favorable scores on all dimensions of the heartburn-specific questionnaire (p < .05). symptom relief after 4 weeks was achieved by 61% (om20), 49% (om10), and 40% (ran) patients (om20 versus om10, p < 0.0167; om20 versus ran, p < 0.0001; om10 versus ran, p < 0.01). both famotidine regimens resulted in a significantly greater proportion of patients with complete endoscopic healing than placebo, with the bid dosing being numerically superior to the 40-mg hs dose. daily diaries documented heartburn relief (score < or = 3/7 on < or = of 7 prior days) and relapse (score > or = 4 on > or = 2 of 7 prior days). in both treatment periods, metoclopramide-treated patients had significantly more symptomatic improvement than the control group (p less than 0.05). <INPUT_END>

performance in line with the guidelines by 13.5% (95% ci = 6% to 20.9%) attributable to outreach, while larger practices improved by only 1.4% (95% ci = -2.4% to 5.3%, p-value for interaction <0.001). physicians in the combined intervention group had higher self-reported and observed rates for several risk assessment questions and counseling recommendations than did physicians in the control group or the group that only received educational materials. both group and individual academic detailing improved antihypertensive prescribing over and above usual care but may require reinforcement to sustain improvements. our objective was to evaluate the effect of training in a patient-centred intervention for gps and practice nurses on outcomes for patients with type ii diabetes. practice-based training plus support telephone calls was the most effective and cost-effective strategy to encourage implementation of sbi by gps. educational outreach visits, particularly when combined with social marketing, appear to be a promising approach to modifying health professional behaviour, especially prescribing. practices participating in the intervention showed increases in the percentage of records containing at least one periodontal diagnostic notation, and those practices employing hygienists showed an increase in the percentage of records with at least one preventive notation and one treatment item.(abstract truncated at 250 words) we conclude that the academic detailing process was successful in modifying prescribing patterns and that it also decreased prescription numbers and costs. one-to-one education obtained an average prescribing behavior improvement of 6.5% (p < 0.001) in the 9 months after intervention. prescribing in both the intervention and control group moved towards that recommended by the guidelines but there was no difference between the groups in either the proportion of prescriptions in line with the guidelines or the overall cost. no change was seen in drug usage, rate of influenza vaccination, functional status, or psychological wellbeing as a result of the intervention. face-to-face visits proved the most successful of the two methods to influence gp prescribing, although the workbook promoted more change than that seen in the control group. in the 6 months post-intervention, median psa testing rate in the eov group was significantly lower than in the postal group, which in turn was significantly lower than the control group (p < 0.001). accepting a visit had little effect on prescribing: a change of 0.003 (95 per cent ci -0.021 to +0.027) dose units. there were no significant differences in use of "minimal intervention" components of the kit, ratings of overall acceptability of delivery, perceptions of cultural and structural barriers to using the kit, and ratings of the overall acceptability of the kit. clinical guidelines implemented with workshops and educational outreach visits improved some but not all aspects of prescribing in the short-term. the visits by non-physician observers resulted in a higher score on extent of use of records and on assessment on outcome and year report. a multifaceted intervention using algorithms can reduce the number of antimicrobial prescriptions for suspected urinary tract infections in residents of nursing homes. a total of 64.3% of the physicians rated the par as useful, 26.5% found the cmep to be useful, and 41.0% considered the mentor strategy to be a useful form of continuing medical education. compared with usual practice, disease management was associated with improvements in helicobacter pylori testing (61% vs 9%; p = .001), use of recommended h pylori treatment regimens (96% vs 10%; p = .001), and discontinuation rates of proton pump therapy after treatment (70% vs 36%; p = .04). they were also partially effective in improving the appropriate use of drugs, reducing the use of non-rehydration medications. local guidelines disseminated via practice based education improve the management of diabetes and possibly of asthma in inner city, non-training practices. during the intervention year intervention practices made 292 more requests (99% increase) and control practices made 74 fewer requests (23% decrease; p=0.001 for difference in median change). a limited simultaneous educational outreach intervention for parents and providers reduced antibiotic use among children in primary care practices, even in the setting of substantial secular trends toward decreased prescribing. patient satisfaction scores improved significantly in the comprehensive intervention group (by 0.06 points on a 1 to 5 scale, p = 0.02) but not in the education only group (by 0.02 points, p = 0.42); however, the improvement was not significantly greater in the comprehensive intervention group (p = 0.20). practices where primary care teams received an educational outreach visit demonstrated a significantly greater improvement in uptake in high-risk groups for pneumococcal but not influenza vaccine. the mean stay in the icu did not differ between the control and intervention groups (10.9 v. 11.8 days; p = 0.7). the use of oral cephalosporins increased in the ig and was reduced in the cg (p less than 0.01). patients in intervention practices had greater improvements than those in control practices for diagnoses of hypertension (improvement difference, 15.7 percentage points [95% ci, 5.2 to 26.3 percentage points]) and blood pressure control in patients with hypertension (improvement difference, 8.0 percentage points [ci, 0.0 to 16.0 percentage points]). a follow-up survey conducted 4 weeks after the intervention showed that the oral information campaign positively affected physicians' attitudes about the value of oral drug information from an industry-independent source. after adjusting for confounders, there was a differential downward trend in prescriptions per diagnosis of insomnia but not to a statistical level. the patient care appraisal did not lead to significant improvement of physicians' management of the conditions. compliance rates for 12 evidence-based indicators for the management of patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, angina pectoris, or heart failure. length of stay, intensive care unit transfers, readmission rates, and in-hospital death rates were similar in both groups (p> or =.10 for all). performance of the procedure necessary to diagnose hypercholesterolaemia even deteriorated. professional standards review organization claims data were used in defining, planning, implementing and evaluating an approach to an ambulatory medical care problem utilizing educational intervention. intervention produced a significant increase (p less than 0.005) in the prescribing cost of ibuprofen, the non-steroidal promoted as first choice agent, which was sustained for at least 5 months. the adjusted increase in adr reporting rates attributable to intervention was 90.19 for total adrs adjusted odds ratios were 1.03 (95% confidence interval 0.78-1.36) in patients whose blood pressure was controlled at baseline and 1.25 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.65) in those whose blood pressure was not. no evidence was found for an improvement in asthma related quality of life among newly surveyed patients in intervention practices compared with control practices. no significant differences were observed for the primary outcome measure: practices receiving outreach visits prescribed only 2.1% [95% confidence interval (ci): -0.8 to 5.0] more of the three recommended nsaids than the control practices did and 1.6% (95% ci: -1.4 to 4.7) more than practices that received guidelines only. neither strategy was effective in improving the appropriateness of otc management of vulvovaginal candidiasis by community pharmacy staff. there was no significant decrease in the number of prescriptions written by the face-to-face group compared with the control group, suggesting that drug substitution rather than deletion was the method used by physicians to lower drug costs. rates of ventouse delivery increased significantly in intervention units but not in control units; there was no difference between the two types of units in uptake of other practices. the number of goals set and the increase in the use of medical record tools were greatest in the combined intervention group, with improvements noted in all groups. mammography completion within 8 weeks of clinic visits was significantly higher among intervention (49%) than control (22%) no differences in appropriateness were found between the two intervention groups, but in the first postintervention month the mean rate of inappropriate prescribing per control practitioner was 80%, versus less than 32% for the intervention groups (p less than 0.01). no significant differences were found between the groups for the time to symptom resolution. at endpoint, cde recommendation and performance rates were both significantly higher for the intervention as compared to the control practices (or = 2.28; 95% ci: 1.37, 3.78, and or = 1.63; 95% ci: 1.06, 2.50, respectively). experimental homes participated in an outreach program that was designed to influence drug use through improved teamwork among physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and nurses' assistants. a marked decrease in benzodiazepine prescribing was seen over the course of the study in both intervention and control groups but no differential effect due to the educational outreach visit was found. in the experimental nursing homes residents who were initially taking antipsychotic drugs showed less deterioration on several measures of cognitive function than similar residents in the control facilities, but they were more likely to report depression. the tailored multifaceted intervention delivered by nurse facilitators was effective in modifying physician practice patterns and significantly improved preventive care performance. there were significantly fewer referrals (20% v 29%; odds ratio 0. there were no significant differences between study groups in the proportion of patients who were referred for x-ray, issued with a sickness certificate, prescribed opioids or muscle relaxants, or who were referred to secondary care, but significantly more patients in the intervention group were referred to physiotherapy or the back pain unit (difference in proportion = 12.2%, 95% confidence interval [ci] = 2.8% to 21.6%). improvements between baseline and posttest in patient recall of fp advice about nicotine replacement patches and gum were significantly greater in the intervention than in the control group (p = 0.0056 and p = 0.0002, respectively). printed educational materials alone may be as effective as audit and feedback and educational outreach in improving nurses' performance and outcomes of care for people with ui. practices were randomized to receive either the intervention for hyperlipidaemia or for hypertension; practices acted as control for the intervention not received. the tailored intervention was evaluated in a randomized trial, and was shown to significantly increase the use of thiazides for patients started on antihypertensive medication, but had little or no impact on other outcomes. results indicated that the outreach program significantly improved many patient care processes (lab work, nursing, dietary management, ventilator management, ventilator weaning). brief, focused educational outreach visits by transfusion specialists can substantially improve the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of blood product use in surgery. after training, there was a significant increase in knowledge about diarrhoea and its treatment among counter attendants in kenya, where these changes were measured. the number of prescriptions of lipid-lowering drugs per month increased in the intervention health centres and the increase was statistically different from the corresponding change in the control health centres among women in the age group 30-65 years (p = 0.03). scores on a counseling measure also significantly increased from a mean of 2.7 to 9.9 in the counseling group, whereas scores in the control group remained low and stable (2.3 and 1.9, respectively). there were no differences between the intervention and control groups for the three month fall rate. asthma specialist nurses using a liaison model of care reduced unscheduled care for asthma in a deprived multiethnic health district. <INPUT_END>
