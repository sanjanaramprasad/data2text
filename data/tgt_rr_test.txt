results indicate that pan may be an effective treatment of the mild to moderate alcoholic withdrawal state. the rapidity of the therapeutic effect of pan therapy coupled with the minimal sedative requirements, may enable patients to enter the psychological treatment phase more quickly than those on sedative regimens, accelerating the patients recovery. our review does not provide strong evidence due to the small sample sizes of the included trials. neither does the review indicate any causes for concern that pan is more harmful than the benzodiazepines. clinicians wishing to use pan may initially wish to do so within trial settings. further high quality trials should be done to confirm these findings and to investigate whether the pan therapy has fewer adverse effects than other treatments for the alcohol withdrawal states. studies to investigate the possible cost-effectiveness of pan by reducing costly hospital admissions and decreasing post administration supervision also need to be performed.
there is insufficient evidence to support the use of parenting programmes to treat physical abuse or neglect. there is, however, limited evidence to show that some parenting programmes may be effective in improving some outcomes that are associated with physically abusive parenting. further research is urgently needed.
valproate is effective in reducing headache frequency and is reasonably well tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine.
this systematic review found one randomised controlled trial with a small number of patients in the different clinical subgroups of neurological manifestation. there is very low-quality evidence that cyclophosphamide is more effective in reducing symptoms of neuropsychiatric involvement in sle compared with methylprednisolone. however, properly designed randomised controlled trials that involve large numbers of individuals, with explicit clinical and laboratory diagnostic criteria, sufficient duration of follow-up and description of all relevant outcome measures, are necessary to guide practice. as we did not find any new trials to include in this review at update, the conclusions of the review did not change.
there is some evidence that patients discharged from a nlu are better prepared for discharge but it is unclear if this is simply a product of an increased length of inpatient stay. no statistically significant adverse effects were noted but the possibility of increased early mortality cannot be discounted. more research is needed.
there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of erythromycin in low or high doses for preterm infants with or at risk of feeding intolerance. future research is needed to determine if there is a more precise dose range where erythromycin might be effective as a prokinetic agent in preterm infants > 32 weeks' ga.
although this review suggests that diazepam alone compared with combination of phenobarbitone and chlorpromazine may be more effective in treating tetanus, the small size, methodological limitations and lack of data on drug safety from available trials preclude definite conclusions to support change in current clinical practice. the application of this observation should be moderated by local needs and circumstances, pending the availability of better evidence. we recommend a reinforcement of preventive measures against tetanus infection and it is hoped that in the light of clear evidence about the preventive efficacy of tetanus toxoid immunization, concerted efforts should be made towards preventive interventions and ultimate eradication such that there will not be enough case materials for a trial. in the event of a need for a trial, a large prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, which compares diazepam alone with combinations of other drugs (excluding diazepam) will be ideal.
epidural analgesia provides better pain relief (especially during movement) in the period up to three postoperative days. it reduces the duration of postoperative tracheal intubation by roughly half. the occurrence of prolonged postoperative mechanical ventilation, myocardial infarction, gastric complications and renal complications was reduced by epidural analgesia. however, current evidence does not confirm the beneficial effect of epidural analgesia on postoperative mortality and other types of complications.
in some cases of unilateral refractive amblyopia it appears that there is a treatment benefit from refractive correction alone. where amblyopia persists there is evidence that adding occlusion further improves vision. despite advances in the understanding of the treatment of amblyopia it is currently still not possible to tailor individual treatment plans for amblyopia. the nature of any dose/response effect from occlusion still needs to be clarified. partial occlusion appears to have the same treatment effect as glasses alone when started simultaneously for the treatment of unilateral refractive amblyopia. treatment regimes for bilateral and unilateral refractive amblyopia need to be investigated further.
since the last publication of this review new good-quality evidence has appeared, strengthening the conclusions of the review. chest physiotherapy does not improve the severity of the disease, respiratory parameters, or reduce length of hospital stay or oxygen requirements in hospitalised infants with acute bronchiolitis not on mechanical ventilation. chest physiotherapy modalities (vibration and percussion or passive expiratory techniques) have shown equally negative results.
the available data from several small trials show that in patients with chronic heart failure, conventional diuretics appear to reduce the risk of death and worsening heart failure compared to placebo. compared to active control, diuretics appear to improve exercise capacity.
in two trials of protein containing synthetic surfactants compared to animal derived surfactant extract, no statistically different clinical differences in death and chronic lung disease were noted. in general, clinical outcomes between the two groups were similar. further well designed studies of adequate size and power will help confirm and refine these findings.
there is no evidence to show a significant beneficial effect of calcium antagonists on muscle function in dmd.
there is only limited evidence that tens reduces pain in labour and it does not seem to have any impact (either positive or negative) on other outcomes for mothers or babies. the use of tens at home in early labour has not been evaluated. tens is widely available in hospital settings and women should have the choice of using it in labour.
given the modest effect on seizure frequency and significant withdrawal rate it is unlikely that remacemide will be further developed as an antiepileptic drug.
curcumin may be a safe and effective therapy for maintenance of remission in quiescent uc when given as adjunctive therapy along with mesalamine or sulfasalazine. however, further research in the form of a large scale methodologically rigorous randomized controlled trial is needed to confirm any possible benefit of curcumin in quiescent uc.
the current evidence base is too heterogeneous and sparse to draw conclusions on the overall effectiveness of family therapy in the treatment of depression. at this point, use of psychological interventions for the treatment of depression for which there is already an evidence-base would seem to be preferable to family therapy. further high quality trials examining the effectiveness and comparative effectiveness of explicitly defined forms of family therapy are required.
there is some evidence that haloperidol is an effective treatment for acute mania. from the limited data available, there was no difference in overall efficacy of treatment between haloperidol and olanzapine or risperidone. some evidence suggests that haloperidol could be less effective than aripiprazole. referring to tolerability, when considering the poor evidence comparing drugs, clinicians and patients should consider different side effect profiles as an important issue to inform their choice.
inactivated vzv vaccine might reduce zoster severity in adult sct recipients. inactivated influenza vaccine might reduce respiratory infections and hospitalization in adults with multiple myeloma or children with leukemia or lymphoma. however, the quality of evidence is low. local adverse effects occur frequently. further high-quality rcts are needed.
in the small trials included in this review, when compared to cotrimoxazole rechallenge for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections, cotrimoxazole desensitization resulted in fewer treatment discontinuations and overall adverse reactions in hiv-infected patients with a previous history of mild or moderate hypersensitivity to cotrimoxazole. paediatric data and trials in resource-poor settings are urgently required. further randomised controlled trials are also needed for the treatment of opportunistic infections, treating-through, adjunctive medications, and different desensitization-dosing schedules.
pretreatment with glucocorticosteroids before treatment with alfa interferon in patients with hepatitis b 'e' antigen positive chronic hepatitis b may be more effective than treatment with alfa interferon alone with regard to loss of hepatitis b 'e' antigen and hepatitis b virus dna, but evidence for effect on clinical outcomes is lacking.
acts appear to be safe for individuals (adults and children) with stable bronchiectasis, where there may be improvements in sputum expectoration, selected measures of lung function and health-related quality of life. the role of these techniques in people with an acute exacerbation of bronchiectasis is unknown. in view of the chronic nature of bronchiectasis, more data are needed to establish the clinical value of acts over the short and long term on patient-important outcomes, including symptoms, on physiological outcomes which may clarify the rationale for each technique and on long-term parameters that impact on disease progression in individuals with stable bronchiectasis. this is necessary in order to provide further guidance of specific act prescription for people with bronchiectasis. it may also be important to establish the comparative effect of different types of acts in people with bronchiectasis.
there was insufficient evidence to reach firm conclusions for practice. there was suggestive evidence of short-term benefit from prompted voiding, but longer-term effects are not known, and prompted voiding has significant resource implications.
honey dressings do not increase rates of healing significantly in venous leg ulcers when used as an adjuvant to compression. honey may delay healing in partial- and full-thickness burns in comparison to early excision and grafting, and in cutaneous leishmaniasis when used as an adjuvant with meglumine antimoniate. honey might be superior to some conventional dressing materials, but there is considerable uncertainty about the replicability and applicability of this evidence. there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice in other types of wounds, and health services may wish to consider avoiding routine use of honey dressings until sufficient evidence of effect is available.
we could not find convincing evidence that nbi is significantly better than high definition wlc for the detection of patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas. we found evidence that nbi might be better than standard definition wlc and equal to high definition wlc for detection the patients with colorectal polyps, or colorectal adenomas.
antibiotics for copd exacerbations showed large and consistent beneficial effects across outcomes of patients admitted to an icu. however, for outpatients and inpatients the results were inconsistent. the risk for treatment failure was significantly reduced in both inpatients and outpatients when all trials (1957 to 2012) were included but not when the analysis for outpatients was restricted to currently used antibiotics. also, antibiotics had no statistically significant effect on mortality and length of hospital stay in inpatients and almost no data on patient-reported outcomes exist. these inconsistent effects call for research into clinical signs and biomarkers that help identify patients who benefit from antibiotics and patients who experience no effect, and in whom downsides of antibiotics (side effects, costs and multi-resistance) could be avoided.
the absolute and comparative efficacy and tolerability of anti-spasticity agents in multiple sclerosis is poorly documented and no recommendations can be made to guide prescribing. the rationale for treating features of the upper motor neurone syndrome must be better understood and sensitive, validated spasticity measures need to be developed.
although dbt and fsht were better than no treatment when used in combination with an alarm, there was insufficient evidence to support their use without an alarm. an alarm on its own was also better than dbt on its own, but there was some evidence that combining an alarm with dbt was better than an alarm on its own, suggesting that dbt may augment the effect of an alarm. there was also some evidence that direct contact with a therapist might enhance the effects of an intervention.
there is no evidence to support the use of abdominal decompression in normal pregnancies. future research should be directed towards the use of abdominal decompression during labour, and during complicated pregnancies.
there is no evidence to show that oxatomide has a significant effect on the control of stable asthma. some studies reported significant benefits in subjective parameters. there was improvement in some lung function outcomes reported, but this were not consistent across measures or studies and may represent reporting bias. adverse events, including drowsiness, were significantly greater with oxatomide than placebo.
a policy of using ecmo in mature infants with severe but potentially reversible respiratory failure results in significantly improved survival without increased risk of severe disability. the benefit of ecmo for babies with diaphragmatic hernia is unclear. further studies are needed to consider the optimal timing for introducing ecmo; to identify which infants are most likely to benefit; and to address the implications of neonatal ecmo during later childhood and adult life.
since the last version of this review three new studies were identified but excluded from the review. current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of cancer pain. more rcts are needed.
there is currently no strong evidence for laser peripheral iridoplasty’s use in treating angle-closure.
use of limited asthma education as it has been practiced does not appear to improve health outcomes in adults with asthma although perceived symptoms may improve. provision of information in the emergency department may be effective, but this needs to be confirmed.
there may be some benefit in using an egg-free diet in infants with suspected egg allergy who have positive specific ige to eggs. little evidence supports the use of various exclusion diets in unselected people with atopic eczema, but that may be because they were not allergic to those substances in the first place. lack of any benefit may also be because the studies were too small and poorly reported. future studies should be appropriately powered focusing on participants with a proven food allergy. in addition a distinction should be made between young children whose food allergies improve with time and older children/adults.
although statistical evidence is minimal for the superiority of pain relief over analgesic therapy, the fact that cpb causes fewer adverse effects than opioids is important for patients. further studies and rcts are recommended to demonstrate the potential efficacy of a less invasive technique under eus guidance.
no definitive conclusions can be made about the efficacy of cardioprotective agents for which pooling of results was impossible. dexrazoxane prevents heart damage and no evidence for a difference in response rate or survival between the dexrazoxane and control groups was identified. the evidence available did not allow us to reach any definite conclusions about adverse effects. we conclude that if the risk of cardiac damage is expected to be high, it might be justified to use dexrazoxane in patients with cancer treated with anthracyclines. however, clinicians should weigh the cardioprotective effect of dexrazoxane against the possible risk of adverse effects for each individual patient.
in conclusion, in this cochrane systematic review we found that that the effects of family-based prevention interventions are small but generally consistent and also persistent into the medium- to longer-term.
the currently available evidence from trials reporting clinically relevant outcomes is low quality and insufficient to draw conclusions on the effects of taping, whether used on its own or as part of a treatment programme. further research involving large, preferably multi-centre, good quality and well reported randomised controlled trials that measure clinically important outcomes and long-term results is warranted. before this, consensus is required on the diagnosis of patellofemoral pain syndrome, the standardisation of outcome measurement and an acceptable approach for patellar taping.
there is insufficient evidence from the two included trials, to conclude that one procedure is better or worse than another. the included trials compared different interventions and were at high risk of bias and therefore no implications for practice can be given. further high quality randomized controlled trials with long term follow-up are required.
there is not evidence to make conclusions on whether recruitment manoeuvres reduce mortality or length of ventilation in patients with ali or ards.
compared with placebo, combination therapy led to a significant reduction of a quarter in exacerbation rates. there was a significant reduction in all-cause mortality with the addition of data from the torch trial. the increased risk of pneumonia is a concern, and better reporting of this outcome in future studies would be helpful. in order to draw firmer conclusions about the effects of combination therapy in a single inhaler more data are necessary, particularly in relation to the profile of adverse events and benefits in relation to different doses of inhaled corticosteroids.
single-dose regimen of antibiotics may be less effective than the seven-day regimen. women with asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy should be treated by the standard regimen of antibiotics until more data become available testing seven-day compared with three- or five-day regimens.
there is limited evidence that cyclosporine is more effective than standard treatment alone for severe ulcerative colitis. the relatively quick response makes the short-term use of cyclosporine potentially attractive, but the long-term benefit is unclear, when adverse events such as cyclosporine-induced nephrotoxicity may become more obvious. there is a need for additional research on quality of life, costs and long-term results from cyclosporine therapy in severe ulcerative colitis.
there is insufficient evidence from high quality comparative studies for the overall superiority of any individual type of prosthetic ankle-foot mechanism, although there is a small trend towards the flex-foot in comparison with the sach foot for greater stride length and lower energy cost in individuals with a transtibial amputation, and improved gait efficiency and lower energy cost in high activity individuals with a transfemoral amputation. in prescribing prosthetic-ankle foot mechanisms for individuals with a lower limb amputation, practitioners should take into account availability, patient functional needs, the type of knee mechanism to be prescribed and the inter-relationship with ankle-foot mechanisms, and cost.
enteral supplementation of probiotics prevents severe nec and all cause mortality in preterm infants. our updated review of available evidence supports a change in practice. more studies are needed to assess efficacy in elbw infants and assess the most effective formulation and dose to be utilized.
d-penicillamine is unlikely to affect survival, and may reduce the incidence of acute rop among survivors. studies to date justify further investigation of this drug in a broader population; careful attention to possible side effects is needed.
there is no evidence to suggest that the use of platinum agents, doxorubicin or paclitaxel used as maintenance chemotherapy is more effective than observation alone. further investigations regarding the effect of paclitaxel used as maintenance chemotherapy are required.
there is limited evidence to suggest that mp in combination with other rehabilitation treatment appears to be beneficial in improving upper extremity function after stroke, as compared with other rehabilitation treatment without mp. evidence regarding improvement in motor recovery and quality of movement is less clear. there is no clear pattern regarding the ideal dosage of mp required to improve outcomes. further studies are required to evaluate the effect of mp on time post stroke, volume of mp that is required to affect the outcomes and whether improvement is maintained long-term. numerous large ongoing studies will soon improve the evidence base.
in settings with limited resources where the number of visits is already low, reduced visits programmes of antenatal care are associated with an increase in perinatal mortality compared to standard care, although admission to neonatal intensive care may be reduced. women prefer the standard visits schedule. where the standard number of visits is low, visits should not be reduced without close monitoring of fetal and neonatal outcome.
due to lack of evidence it is impossible to determine whether amantadine is a safe and effective form of treatment for levodopa-induced dyskinesias in patients with parkinson's disease.
based on the heterogeneity and the low quality of the included trials that precluded pooled meta-analysis, there is silver level evidence that following hip or knee joint replacement, early multidisciplinary rehabilitation can improve outcomes at the level of activity and participation. the optimal intensity, frequency and effects of rehabilitation over a longer period and associated social costs need further study. future research should focus on improving methodological and scientific rigour of clinical trials, and use of standardised outcome measures, so that results can be pooled for statistical analysis.
the effects of volume expansion therapy have been studied properly in only two trials of patients with aneurysmal sah, with very small numbers. at present, there is no sound evidence for the use of volume expansion therapy in patients with aneurysmal sah.
evidence for the effectiveness of sgas is limited to one small trial of fluoxetine compared with placebo, which shows a non-significant effect in favour of fluoxetine, and two small trials comparing fluoxetine against light therapy, which suggest equivalence between the two interventions. the lack of available evidence precludes the ability to draw any overall conclusions on the use of sgas for sad. further larger rcts are required to expand and strengthen the evidence base on this topic, and should also include comparisons with psychotherapy and other sgas. data on adverse events were sparse, and a comparative analysis was not possible. therefore the data we obtained on adverse effects is not robust and our confidence in the data is limited. overall, up to 27% of participants treated with sgas for sad withdrew from the studies early due to adverse effects. the overall quality of evidence in this review is very low.
at present, data from trials do not confirm or refute an advantage for cr cbz over ir cbz for seizure frequency or adverse events in patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy. for trials involving epilepsy patients already prescribed ir cbz, no conclusions can be drawn concerning the superiority of cr cbz with respect to seizure frequency. there is a trend for cr cbz to be associated with fewer adverse events when compared to ir cbz. a change to cr cbz may therefore be a worthwhile strategy in patients with acceptable seizure control on ir cbz but experiencing unacceptable adverse events. the included trials were of small size, poor methodological quality and possessed a high risk of bias, limiting the validity of this conclusion. randomised controlled trials comparing cr cbz to ir cbz and using clinically relevant outcomes are required to inform the choice of cbz preparation for patients with newly diagnosed epilepsy.
as only one study was identified for inclusion, the results are inadequate to inform clinical practice in regard to the use of email for clinical communication between healthcare professionals. future research needs to use high-quality study designs that take advantage of the most recent developments in information technology, with consideration of the complexity of email as an intervention, and costs.
based on two brace and three insole studies, we conclude that there is 'silver' level evidence (www.cochranemsk.org) that a brace and a lateral wedge insole have small beneficial effect. there is 'silver' level evidence that strapped insoles correct leg alignment. however, long-term adherence to brace and insole treatment is low. there is no evidence whether a brace is more effective than an insole.
there is lack of robust and randomised controlled evidence that can clarify the efficacy of propofol and thiopental sodium over each other in the treatment of rse. there is a need for large, randomised controlled trials for this serious condition.
epidural analgesia may be useful for postoperative pain relief following major lower limb joint replacements. however, the benefits may be limited to the early (four to six hours) postoperative period. an epidural infusion of local anaesthetic or local anaesthetic-narcotic mixture may be better than epidural narcotic alone. the magnitude of pain relief must be weighed against the frequency of adverse events. the current evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions on the frequency of rare complications from epidural analgesia, postoperative morbidity or mortality, functional outcomes, or length of hospital stay.
the licensed ty21a and vi polysaccharide vaccines are efficacious. the new and unlicensed vi-repa vaccine is as efficacious and may confer longer immunity.
electrocoagulation was associated with less morbidity including post-operative pain when compared with the modified pomeroy and tubal ring methods, despite the risk of burns to the small bowel. the small sample size and the relative short period of follow-up in these studies limited the power to show clinical or statistical differences for rare outcomes such as failure rates. aspects such as training, costs and maintenance of the equipment may be important factors in deciding which method to choose.
one year of 28 iu/m²/wk rhgh in children with ckd resulted in a 3.88 cm increase in height velocity above that of untreated patients. studies were too short to determine if continuing treatment resulted in an increase in final adult height.
complete avoidance of breastfeeding is efficacious in preventing mtct of hiv, but this intervention has significant associated morbidity (e.g., diarrheal morbidity if formula is prepared without clean water). if breastfeeding is initiated, two interventions 1). exclusive breastfeeding during the first few months of life; and 2) extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant (nevirapine alone, or nevirapine with zidovudine) are efficacious in preventing transmission.
this review fails to demonstrate a clear overall benefit from prophylactic antibiotic treatment for preterm labour with intact membranes on neonatal outcomes and raises concerns about increased neonatal mortality for those who received antibiotics. this treatment cannot therefore be currently recommended for routine practice. further research may be justified (when sensitive markers for subclinical infection become available) in order to determine if there is a subgroup of women who could experience benefit from antibiotic treatment for preterm labour prior to membrane rupture, and to identify which antibiotic or combination of antibiotics is most effective. [note: the 17 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
the efficacy of corticosteroid injections for de quervain's tenosynovitis has been studied in only one small controlled clinical trial, which found steroid injections to be superior to thumb spica splinting. however, the applicability of our findings to daily clinical practice is limited, as they are based on only one trial with a small number of included participants, the methodological quality was poor and only pregnant and lactating women participated in the study. no adverse effects were observed.
the one significant pooled effect in the current review does not allow for any firm conclusions to be made about the impact of prevention programs for eating disorders in children and adolescents, although none of the pooled comparisons indicated evidence of harm. the meta-analysis is in the process of being revised to account for the impact of cluster randomised trials.
the evidence that exercise therapy is more effective in treating pfps than no exercise was limited with respect to pain reduction, and conflicting with respect to functional improvement. there is strong evidence that open and closed kinetic chain exercise are equally effective. further research to substantiate the efficacy of exercise treatment compared to a non-exercising control group is needed, and thorough consideration should be given to methodological aspects of study design and reporting.
the small number of studies included in this review do not permit any conclusions to be drawn on the effectiveness of meditation therapy for anxiety disorders. transcendental meditation is comparable with other kinds of relaxation therapies in reducing anxiety, and kundalini yoga did not show significant effectiveness in treating obsessive-compulsive disorders compared with relaxation/meditation. drop out rates appear to be high, and adverse effects of meditation have not been reported. more trials are needed.
aquatic exercise appears to have some beneficial short-term effects for patients with hip and/or knee oa while no long-term effects have been documented. based on this, one may consider using aquatic exercise as the first part of a longer exercise programme for osteoarthritis patients. the controlled and randomised studies in this area are still too few to give further recommendations on how to apply the therapy, and studies of clearly defined patient groups with long-term outcomes are needed to decide on the further use of this therapy in the treatment of osteoarthritis.
evidence is available for the effectiveness of comprehensive voice therapy comprising both direct and indirect therapy elements. effects are similar in patients and in teachers and student teachers screened for voice problems. larger and methodologically better studies are needed with outcome measures that match treatment aims.
oral acyclovir did not reduce the incidence of phn significantly. there is insufficient evidence from randomised controlled trials to determine whether other antiviral treatments prevent phn. additional well-designed, randomised controlled trials of famciclovir or other new antiviral agents, with a greater number of participants are needed. future trials should pay more attention to the severity of pain and quality of life of participants, and should be conducted among different subgroups of people, such as people who are immunocompromised.
art is a potent intervention for prevention of hiv in discordant couples in which the index partner has ≤550 cd4 cells/µl. a recent multicentre rct confirms the suspected benefit seen in earlier observational studies and reported in more recent ones. questions remain about durability of protection, the balance of benefits and adverse events associated with earlier therapy, long-term adherence and transmission of art-resistant strains to partners. resource limitations and implementation challenges must also be addressed. counselling, support, and follow up, as well as mutual disclosure, may have a role in supporting adherence, so programmes should be designed with these components. in addition to art provision, the operational aspects of delivering such programmes must be considered.
there is a lack of evidence for the benefits or risks of the different treatments for both stuttering and fulminant priapism in sickle cell disease. this systematic review has clearly identified the need for well-designed, adequately-powered, multicentre randomised controlled trials assessing the effectiveness of specific interventions for priapism in sickle cell disease.
hysteroscopic myomectomy might increase the odds of clinical pregnancy in women with unexplained subfertility and submucous fibroids, but the evidence is at present not conclusive. the hysteroscopic removal of endometrial polyps suspected on ultrasound in women prior to iui might increase the clinical pregnancy rate. more randomised studies are needed to substantiate the effectiveness of the hysteroscopic removal of suspected endometrial polyps, submucous fibroids, uterine septum or intrauterine adhesions in women with unexplained subfertility or prior to iui, ivf or icsi.
we did not find evidence either to support or refute the use of colchicine for patients with primary biliary cirrhosis. as we are not able to exclude a detrimental effect of colchicine, we suggest that it is only used in randomised clinical trials.
we did not find rcts evaluating the effects of primary surgical versus primary non-surgical interventions for central giant cell granuloma of the jaws. although a number of non-surgical therapies have been proposed for treating central giant cell granuloma of the jaws, our review did not identify evidence from rcts to support their use. more research is needed on this topic.
implications for practice: nippv is a useful method of augmenting the beneficial effects of ncpap in preterm infants. its use reduces the incidence of symptoms of extubation failure more effectively than ncpap. within the limits of the small numbers of infants randomised to nippv there is a reassuring absence of the gastrointestinal side effects that were reported in previous case series. implications for research: future trials should enroll a sufficient number of infants to detect differences in important outcomes such as chronic lung disease and gastrointestinal perforation. the impact of synchronisation of nippv on the technique's safety and efficacy should be established in future trials.
according to the results, there is no evidence from randomised controlled trials to indicate any benefit of zinc supplementation with regards to serum zinc level in patients with thalassaemia. however, height velocity was noted to increase among those who received this intervention. there is mixed evidence on the benefit of using zinc supplementation in people with sickle cell disease. for instance, there is evidence that zinc supplementation for one year increased the serum zinc levels in patients with sickle cell disease. however, though serum zinc level was raised in patients receiving zinc supplementation, haemoglobin level and anthropometry measurements were not significantly different between groups. evidence of benefit is seen with the reduction in the number of sickle cell crises among sickle cell patients who received one year of zinc sulphate supplementation and with the reduction in the total number of clinical infections among sickle cell patients who received zinc supplementation for both three months and for one year. the conclusion is based on the data from a small group of trials,which were generally of good quality, with a low risk of bias. the authors recommend that more trials on zinc supplementation in thalassaemia and sickle cell disease be conducted given that the literature has shown the benefits of zinc in these types of diseases.
there is no convincing evidence relating type or intensity of diabetic treatment to the prevention or management of cognitive impairment in type ii diabetes. future research on treatments for diabetes should include standardized assessments of cognitive function as outcome measures.
the meta-analysis shows that exercise significantly improves glycaemic control and reduces visceral adipose tissue and plasma triglycerides, but not plasma cholesterol, in people with type 2 diabetes, even without weight loss.
thrombolysis appears to offer advantages in terms of reducing post-thrombotic syndrome and maintaining venous patency after dvt. use of strict eligibility criteria has improved the safety and acceptability of this treatment. the optimum drug, dose and route of administration have yet to be determined.
u and lmw heparins protect against lower limb dvt. there is insufficient evidence to confirm either protection against pulmonary embolism or an overall benefit, or to distinguish between various applications of heparin. foot and calf pumping devices appear to prevent dvt, may protect against pulmonary embolism, and reduce mortality, but compliance remains a problem. good quality trials of mechanical methods as well as direct comparisons with heparin and low dose aspirin should be considered.
low-dose rate brachytherapy did not reduce biochemical recurrence-free survival versus radical prostatectomy at 5 years. for short-term severe adverse events, low-dose rate brachytherapy was significantly more favorable for urinary incontinence, but radical prostatectomy was significantly more favorable for urinary irritation. evidence is based on one rct with high risk of bias.
the findings of this review identified one its study for a non-medical procedure conducted in a dental outpatient setting. the study suggested that the use of a specific educational intervention, in the above-mentioned context, which targets junior dental staff using a training session that included cases of wrong-site surgery, presentation of clinical guidelines and feedback by the instructor, was associated with a reduction in the incidence of wrong-site tooth extractions. given the nature of the intervention in a very specific population, application of these results to a broader population undergoing other forms of surgery or invasive procedures should be undertaken cautiously.
there was a clear primary patency benefit for autologous vein when compared to synthetic materials for above knee bypasses. in the long term (five years) dacron confers a small primary patency benefit over ptfe for above knee bypass. ptfe with a vein cuff improved primary patency when compared to ptfe alone for below knee bypasses. further randomised data is needed to ascertain whether this information translates into improvement in limb survival.
perioperative chemotherapy for resectable gastroesophageal adenocarcinoma increases survival compared to surgery alone. it should thus be offered to all eligible patients. there is a trend to a larger survival advantage for tumors of the ge junction as compared to other sites and for chemoradiotherapy as compared to chemotherapy in esophageal and ge junction tumors. likewise, there is an interaction between age and treatment effect, with younger patients having a larger survival advantage, and no survival advantage for elderly patients.
metronidazole, given as a single dose, is likely to provide parasitological cure for trichomoniasis, but it is not known whether this treatment will have any effect on pregnancy outcomes. the cure rate could probably be higher if more partners used the treatment.
placebo-controlled trials have established the benefits of both long-acting beta-agonist and inhaled corticosteroid therapy for copd patients as individual therapies. this review, which included trials allowing comparisons between laba and ics, has shown that the two therapies confer similar benefits across the majority of outcomes, including the frequency of exacerbations and mortality. use of long-acting beta-agonists appears to confer a small additional benefit in terms of improvements in lung function compared to inhaled corticosteroids. on the other hand, inhaled corticosteroid therapy shows a small advantage over long-acting beta-agonist therapy in terms of health-related quality of life, but inhaled corticosteroids also increase the risk of pneumonia. this review supports current guidelines advocating long-acting beta-agonists as frontline therapy for copd, with regular inhaled corticosteroid therapy as an adjunct in patients experiencing frequent exacerbations.
immunoglobulins seem to be effective for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of hepatitis a. however, caution is warranted for the positive findings due to the limited number of trials, year of conductance, and risk of bias. conductance of rigorous trials will be justifiable.
these results suggest that children with acute pyelonephritis can be treated effectively with oral antibiotics (cefixime, ceftibuten and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) or with short courses (2 to 4 days) of iv therapy followed by oral therapy. if iv therapy is chosen, single daily dosing with aminoglycosides is safe and effective. studies are required to determine the optimal total duration of therapy.
implications for practice: nasal cpap is effective in preventing failure of extubation in preterm infants following a period of endotracheal intubation and ippv. implication for research: further definition of the gestational age and weight groups in whom these results apply is warranted. optimal levels of ncpap as well as methods of administration remain to be determined.
the results of this review do not support the use of prophylactic caffeine for preterm infants at risk of apnoea. any future studies need to examine the effects of prophylactic methylxanthines in preterm infants at higher risk of apnoea. this should include examination of important clinical outcomes such as need for ippv, neonatal morbidity, length of hospital stay and long term development.
calcium supplementation appears to approximately halve the risk of pre-eclampsia, to reduce the risk of preterm birth and to reduce the occurrence of the composite outcome 'death or serious morbidity'. we considered the latter benefit to outweigh the increase in hellp syndrome, which was small in absolute numbers. there were no other clear benefits, or harms.
there was insufficient evidence to assess the effectiveness of chinese herbal medicines alone for treating threatened miscarriage. a combination of chinese herbal and western medicines was more effective than western medicines alone for treating threatened miscarriage. however, the quality of the included studies was poor. more high quality studies are necessary to further evaluate the effectiveness of chinese herbal medicines for threatened miscarriage.
caffeine appears to improve airways function modestly, for up to four hours, in people with asthma. people may need to avoid caffeine for at least four hours prior to lung function testing, as caffeine ingestion could cause misinterpretation of the results. drinking caffeinated coffee before taking exhaled nitric oxide measurements does not appear to affect the results of the test, but more studies are needed to confirm this.
the clinical studies on nicergoline were carried out with diverse criteria and modalities of evaluation. despite this, the 14 studies included in this review, have presented generally consistent results. results of this meta-analysis provide some evidence of positive effects of nicergoline on cognition and behaviour and these effects are supported by an effect on clinical global impression. there was some evidence that there were increased risk of adverse effects associated with nicergoline. these results were obtained on older patients with mild to moderate cognitive and behavioural impairment of various clinical origins, including chronic cerebrovascular disorders and alzheimer's dementia. the few studies specifically performed on patients with alzheimer's disease were performed with too few people to give a definitive answer to the questions concerning the use of nicergoline for this form of dementia.this drug has not been evaluated using current diagnostic categories such as mci or in association with therapeutic agents of different nature such as cholinesterase or antioxidant drugs.
these data do not support the use of tamoxifen for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. further research on the effects of tamoxifen in hepatocellular carcinoma does not seem warranted.
there is currently not enough evidence from randomised controlled trials regarding the efficacy or safety of gp iib-iiia inhibitors therapy in acute ischaemic stroke. results from ongoing trials will help to understand the risk to benefit ratio of these agents.
although there were significant glucose-lowering effects with the use of some herbal mixtures, due to methodological deficiencies and small sample sizes we are unable to draw any definite conclusions regarding their efficacy. though no significant adverse events were reported, there is insufficient evidence at present to recommend the use of these interventions in routine clinical practice and further studies are needed.
since no rcts, quasi-randomised trials or ccts in which only the use of intracystic bleomycin differed between the treatment groups in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children, no definitive conclusions could be made about the effects of intracystic bleomycin in these patients. only one low-power rct comparing intracystic bleomycin with intracystic 32p treatment was available, but no definitive conclusions can be made about the effectiveness of these agents in children with cystic craniopharyngiomas. based on the currently available evidence, we are not able to give recommendations for the use of intracystic bleomycin in the treatment of cystic craniopharyngiomas in children. high quality rcts are needed.
the vast majority of technical, human and organisational interventions that are recommended by standard texts of safety, consultants and safety courses have not been adequately evaluated. there is no evidence that introducing regulations for reducing fatal and non-fatal injuries are effective as such. there is neither evidence that regionally oriented safety campaigns, training, inspections nor the introduction of occupational health services are effective at reducing non-fatal injuries in construction companies. there is low-quality evidence that company-oriented safety interventions such as a multifaceted safety campaign and a multifaceted drug workplace programme can reduce non-fatal injuries among construction workers. additional strategies are needed to increase the compliance of employers and workers to the safety measures that are prescribed by regulation. continuing company-oriented interventions among management and construction workers, such as a targeted safety campaign or a drug-free workplace programme, seem to have an effect in reducing injuries in the longer term.
brynskov 1989a enrolled a small number of patients and the modified clinical grading scale used in the study has not been validated in other studies. furthermore, statistically significant clinical improvement does not imply induction of clinical remission. indeed, brynskov 1989a found no statistically significant differences in the mean crohn's disease activity index score at 12 weeks indicating that cyclosporine was no more effective than placebo for induction of remission in crohn's disease. the results of this review demonstrate that low dose (5 mg/kg/day) oral cyclosporine is not effective for the induction of remission in crohn's disease. patients treated with low dose oral cyclosporine are more likely than placebo treated patients to experience adverse events including renal dysfunction. the use of low dose oral cyclosporine for the treatment of chronic active crohn's disease does not appear to be justified. oral dosing at higher levels or parenteral administration of cyclosporine have not been adequately evaluated in controlled clinical trials. higher doses of cyclosporine are not likely to be useful for the long-term management of crohn's disease because of the risk of nephrotoxicity and the availability of other proven interventions.
we have found no conclusive evidence to indicate that the use of recombinant human growth hormone therapy in children with x-linked hypophosphatemia is associated with changes in longitudinal growth, mineral metabolism, endocrine, renal function, bone mineral density, and body proportions.
peginterferon plus ribavirin may be considered a treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis c and stable hiv who have not received treatment for hepatitis c as the intervention may clear the blood of hcv rna. supporting evidence comes mainly from the analysis of this non-validated surrogate outcome assessed in comparisons against other antiviral treatments. there is no evidence on treatment of patients who have relapsed or did not respond to previous therapy. careful monitoring of adverse events is warranted.
despite some positive results shown in the included trials, there is insufficient evidence that biofeedback is effective for the management of pain during labour.
conclusive evidence supporting the treatment of acute ocular surface burns with amt is lacking. heterogeneity of disease presentation, variations in treatment, undefined criteria for treatment success and failure, and non-uniform outcome measures are some of the factors complicating the search for clear evidence regarding this treatment.
delivery of the placenta with cord traction at caesarean section has more advantages compared to manual removal. these are less endometritis; less blood loss; less decrease in haematocrit levels postoperatively; and shorter duration of hospital stay. future trials should provide information on interval between the delivery of the infant and of the placenta, change in lochia, blood splashing during placental removal and uterine pain after operation, as well as the effects of delayed cord clamping.
there is currently no evidence that beta blockers adversely affect walking distance in people with intermittent claudication. however, due to the lack of large published trials beta blockers should be used with caution if clinically indicated.
a few non-invasive physical treatments may be effective as prophylactic treatments for chronic/recurrent headaches. based on trial results, these treatments appear to be associated with little risk of serious adverse effects. the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of non-invasive physical treatments require further research using scientifically rigorous methods. the heterogeneity of the studies included in this review means that the results of a few additional high-quality trials in the future could easily change the conclusions of our review.
the present review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of inhaled steroids in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. while a therapeutic trial may be justified in adults with difficult to control symptoms and in certain subgroups, this has to be balanced with adverse events especially if high doses are used. no recommendation can be made for the use of ics in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state) as there were no studies.
evidence available to date does not allow any firm conclusions to be drawn concerning the effectiveness of ambulatory domicilary oxygen therapy in patients with copd. further studies are required in order to understand the role of ambulatory oxygen in the management of patients with copd on long-term oxygen therapy. these studies should separate patients who desaturate from those who do not desaturate.
there are no high quality data on the efficacy of dietary intervention for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. more well-designed, long-term studies, providing well-reported, high-quality data are required before proper conclusions can be made into the best dietary advice for the prevention of diabetes mellitus in adults.
recommendations on the use of zuclopenthixol acetate for the management of psychiatric emergencies in preference to 'standard' treatment have to be viewed with caution. most of the small trials present important methodological flaws and findings are poorly reported. this review did not find any suggestion that zuclopenthixol acetate is more or less effective in controlling aggressive acute psychosis, or in preventing adverse effects than intramuscular haloperidol, and neither seemed to have a rapid onset of action. use of zuclopenthixol acetate may result in less numerous coercive injections and low doses of the drug may be as effective as higher doses. well-conducted pragmatic randomised controlled trials are needed.
p-chem may reduce the risk of progression to gtn in women with cms who are at a high risk of malignant transformation; however, current evidence in favour of p-chem is limited by the poor methodological quality and small size of the included studies. as p-chem may increase drug resistance, delay treatment of gtn and expose women unnecessarily to toxic side effects, this practice cannot currently be recommended.
there is no firm evidence to support or refute tace or tae for patients with unresectable hcc. more adequately powered and bias-protected trials are needed.
the limited evidence does not demonstrate that ginkgo biloba is effective for tinnitus when this is the primary complaint.
considering the small number of patients examined, the methodological flaws in many of the studies and the possibility of publication bias, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of any given form of physiotherapy over another in parkinson's disease. another cochrane review, physiotherapy for patients with parkinson's disease, found that there was insufficient evidence to support or refute the efficacy of physiotherapy compared to no physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. a wide range of physiotherapy approaches were used in these studies and a survey of uk physiotherapists confirmed that they also use an eclectic combination of techniques in the treatment of parkinson's disease (plant 1999). therefore a consensus must be found as to 'best practice' physiotherapy for parkinson's disease. the efficacy of 'standard' physiotherapy should be proved first before examining variations in physiotherapy methods. therefore large well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to judge the effect of physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. after this large rcts are needed to demonstrate the most effective form of physiotherapy in parkinson's disease. outcome measures with particular relevance to patients, carers, physiotherapists and physicians should be chosen and the patients monitored for at least 6 months to determine the duration of any effect. the trials should be reported according to consort guidelines (consort 1996).
this review suggests topical steroids for nasal polyposis in patients with cystic fibrosis have no demonstrable effect on subjective nasal symptom scores. they have some effect in reducing the size of the polyps, but due to the small sample size, poor study completion rates and lack of follow-up, the study is at high risk of bias and evidence for efficacy is limited. overall there is no clear evidence for using topical steroids in people with cystic fibrosis and nasal polyposis. a well-designed randomised controlled trial of adequate power and long-term follow-up is needed. validated measures of symptoms and physical findings should be performed and quality of life issues addressed.
in women with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer, ability to achieve surgery with complete cytoreduction (no visible residual disease) is associated with significant improvement in overall survival. however, in the absence of rct evidence, it is not clear whether this is solely due to surgical effect or due to tumour biology. indirect evidence would support surgery to achieve complete cytoreduction in selected women. the risks of major surgery need to be carefully balanced against potential benefits on a case-by-case basis.
since the last version of the review, neither of the two new relevant studies have provided additional information to change the conclusions. in patients with acute ischaemic stroke, immediate anticoagulant therapy is not associated with net short or long-term benefit. treatment with anticoagulants reduced recurrent stroke, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, but increased bleeding risk. the data do not support the routine use of any the currently available anticoagulants in acute ischaemic stroke.
there is no evidence to support or refute the use of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation. there is no evidence to prefer any particular technique of veno-venous bypass in liver transplantation.
this review found that programmes to promote smoke alarms have at most modest beneficial effects on smoke alarm ownership and function, and no demonstrated beneficial effect on fires or fire-related injuries. counselling as part of child health surveillance has a somewhat greater effect on smoke alarm ownership and function, but its effects on injuries are unevaluated. community smoke alarm give-away programmes have not been demonstrated to increase smoke alarm prevalence or to reduce fires or fire-related injuries. community-based education programmes have not been shown to reduce burns or fire-related injuries. community smoke alarm installation programmes may increase the prevalence of working alarms and reduce fire-related injuries, but these results require confirmation, and the cost-effectiveness of such programmes has not been evaluated. efforts to promote smoke alarms through installation programmes should be evaluated by adequately designed randomised controlled trials measuring injury outcomes and cost-effectiveness.
the data are too few to support the use of hydration as a specific treatment for women presenting with preterm labour. the two small studies available do not show any advantage of hydration compared to bed rest alone. intravenous hydration does not seem to be beneficial, even during the period of evaluation soon after admission, in women with preterm labour. women with evidence of dehydration may, however, benefit from the intervention.
there is encouraging evidence that some patients may benefit from exercise therapy and no evidence that exercise therapy may worsen outcomes on average. however the treatment may be less acceptable to patients than other management approaches, such as rest or pacing. patients with cfs who are similar to those in these trials should be offered exercise therapy, and their progress monitored further high quality randomised studies are needed.
there is no evidence of benefit or harm in the limited number of small-sized published trials. adherence to relevant cf guidelines on vitamin d should be considered until further evidence is available.
surgical sealants reduce postoperative air leaks and time to chest drain removal but this reduction is not always associated with a reduction in length of postoperative hospital stay. therefore, systematic use of surgical sealants with the objective of reducing hospital stay cannot be recommended at the moment. more and larger randomized controlled clinical trials are needed.
concerns over the analysis and availability of data from the studies bring into question the superiority of ics/laba over laba alone in preventing exacerbations. the effects on hospitalisations were inconsistent and require further exploration. there was moderate quality evidence of an increased risk of pneumonia with ics/laba. there was moderate quality evidence that treatments had similar effects on mortality. quality of life, symptoms score, rescue medication use and fev1 improved more on ics/laba than on laba, but the average differences were probably not clinically significant for these outcomes. to an individual patient the increased risk of pneumonia needs to be balanced against the possible reduction in exacerbations. more information would be useful on the relative benefits and adverse event rates with combination inhalers using different doses of inhaled corticosteroids. evidence from head-to-head comparisons is needed to assess the comparative risks and benefits of the different combination inhalers.
sulfasalazine has modest efficacy compared to placebo and is inferior to corticosteroids for the treatment of mild to moderately active crohn's disease. olsalazine and low dose mesalamine (1 to 2 g/day) are not superior to placebo. high dose mesalamine (3 to 4.5 g/day) is not more effective than placebo for inducing response or remission. high dose mesalamine was inferior to budesonide for inducing remission in a single trial. in conclusion, sulfasalazine shows modest efficacy for the treatment of active crohn's disease. however, the existing data show little benefit for 5-aminosalicylates.
if available, breastfeeding or breast milk should be used to alleviate procedural pain in neonates undergoing a single painful procedure rather than placebo, positioning or no intervention. administration of glucose/sucrose had similar effectiveness as breastfeeding for reducing pain. the effectiveness of breast milk for painful procedure should be studied in the preterm population, as there are currently a limited number of studies in the literature that have assessed it's effectiveness in this population.
there is some evidence that face washing combined with topical tetracycline can be effective in reducing severe trachoma and in increasing the prevalence of clean faces. current evidence does not however support a beneficial effect of face washing alone or in combination with topical tetracycline in reducing active trachoma.
while the choice between dpma and net-en as injectable progestogen contraceptives may vary between both health providers and patients, data from randomized controlled trials indicate little difference between the effects of these methods, except that women on dmpa are more likely to develop amenorrhoea. there is inadequate data to detect differences in some non-menstrual major and minor clinical effects.
the effects of general antenatal education for childbirth or parenthood, or both, remain largely unknown. individualized prenatal education directed toward avoidance of a repeat caesarean birth does not increase the rate of vaginal birth after caesarean section. [note: the 58 citations in the awaiting classification section may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
there is limited evidence to support the use of pilocarpine hydrochloride in the treatment of radiation-induced salivary gland dysfunction. currently, there is little evidence to support the use of other parasympathomimetic drugs in the treatment of this condition. available studies suggest approximately half of patients will respond, but side effects to responders can be problematic. adverse effects are dose dependant therefore it is important to keep dose to 5 mg tds.
for the secondary prevention of recurrent ischemic stroke after tia or minor stroke of presumed arterial origin, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that vitamin k antagonists in any dose are not more efficacious than antiplatelet therapy and that medium and high intensity anticoagulation leads to a significant increase in major bleeding complications.
the available randomized controlled literature does not permit any meaningful conclusions about the efficacy of any form of treatment for ocular myasthenia. data from several reasonably good quality observational studies suggest that corticosteroids and azathioprine may be beneficial in reducing the risk of progression to generalized myasthenia gravis.
variation in the measures used, the included populations and interventions, and the risk of bias within the included studies limit the conclusions that can be reached. the findings provide some evidence to suggest that parenting programmes may be effective in improving a number of aspects of parent-child interaction both in the short- and long-term, but further research is now needed.
interventions aimed at increasing exercise combined with diet are able to decrease the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in high risk groups (people with impaired glucose tolerance or the metabolic syndrome). there is a need for studies exploring exercise only interventions and studies exploring the effect of exercise and diet on quality of life, morbidity and mortality, with special focus on cardiovascular outcomes.
the effectiveness of vasodilators in the treatment of isshl remains unproven. the included studies were of relatively poor quality and the number of patients included was small. moreover, there were differences in the type, dosage and duration of vasodilator used in each study. due to the degree of heterogeneity the results could not be combined to reach a conclusion.
tramadol or tramadol/paracetamol decreases pain intensity, produces symptom relief and improves function, but these benefits are small. adverse events, although reversible and not life threatening, often cause participants to stop taking the medication and could limit tramadol or tramadol plus paracetamol usefulness.
pooled data suggest that natalizumab is effective for induction of clinical response and remission in some patients with moderately to severely active crohn's disease. the clinical benefit of induction therapy with natalizumab in crohn's disease should be weighed against the potential risk of serious adverse events. preliminary data from the retrospective investigation of adverse events associated with natalizumab suggest that it may be possible to identify patients at risk for pml by testing for the appearance of jc virus in plasma.
for pregnant women with non-severe pre-existing or non-proteinuric gestational hypertension, there is insufficient evidence to determine how tight control of hypertension should be achieved to improve maternal and fetal-neonatal outcomes.
although it is desirable to reduce the number of antiretroviral drugs given in combination therapy for reasons of compliance and toxicity, maintenance regimens with fewer drugs are associated with significantly increased resistance and risk of loss of viral suppression. successful initial therapy, as evidenced by suppresion of viral load, should not be modified in the maintenance phase unless clinically necessary.
the small body of evidence available provides no consistent evidence that the public release of performance data changes consumer behaviour or improves care. evidence that the public release of performance data may have an impact on the behaviour of healthcare professionals or organisations is lacking.
there are insufficient studies which compare differing methods of chest drain clearance to support or refute the relative efficacy of the various methods in preventing cardiac tamponade. nor can the need to manipulate chest drains be supported or refuted by results from rcts.
caffeine has shown effectiveness for treating pdph, decreasing the proportion of participants with pdph persistence and those requiring supplementary interventions, when compared with placebo. gabapentin, theophylline and hydrocortisone have also shown a decrease in pain severity scores when compared with placebo or conventional care. there is a lack of conclusive evidence for the other drugs assessed (sumatriptan and acth). these conclusions should be interpreted with caution, due to the lack of information to allow correct appraisal of risk of bias, the small sample sizes of studies and also the limited generalisability, as most participants were post-partum women in their 30s.
antibiotic prophylaxis is effective in the prevention of postoperative complications in appendectomised patients, whether the administration is given pre-, peri- or post-operatively, and could be considered for routine in emergency appendectomies.
data for most comparisons were only available from single studies and they are too small for reliable conclusions about which types of dietary advice are the most suitable for women with gdm. based on the current available evidence, we did not find any significant benefits of the diets investigated. further larger trials with sufficient power to assess the effects of different diets for women with gdm on maternal and infant health outcomes are needed. outcomes such as longer-term health outcomes for women and their babies, women's quality of life and health service cost should be included.
there was no clear evidence that pep was a more or less effective intervention overall than other forms of physiotherapy. there was limited evidence that pep was preferred by participants compared to other techniques, but this finding is from studies of low quality.
this small but clear improvement in survival from chemotherapy encourages further study of drug treatment of these tumours
whether steroidal contraceptives influence fracture risk cannot be determined from existing information. many trials had small numbers of participants and some had large losses to follow up. health care providers and women should consider the costs and benefits of these effective contraceptives. for example, injectable contraceptives and implants provide effective, long-term birth control yet do not involve a daily regimen. progestin-only contraceptives are considered appropriate for women who should avoid estrogen due to medical conditions.
doxorubicin-based adjuvant chemotherapy appears to significantly improve time to local and distant recurrence and overall recurrence-free survival in adults with localised resectable soft tissue sarcoma. there is some evidence of a trend towards improved overall survival.
in exacerbation of myasthenia gravis, one rct of ivig versus placebo showed some evidence of the efficacy of ivig and two did not show a significant difference between ivig and plasma exchange. another showed no significant difference in efficacy between 1 g/kg and 2 g/kg of ivig. a further, but underpowered, trial showed no significant difference between ivig and oral methylprednisolone. in chronic myasthenia gravis, there is insufficient evidence from rcts to determine whether ivig is efficacious.
the evidence base for the use of vitamin d for chronic pain in adults is poor at present. this is due to low quality and insufficient randomised controlled trials in this area of research.
we did not find convincing evidence that bcaa had a significant beneficial effect on patients with hepatic encephalopathy. the trials performed in this field were small with short follow-up and most had low methodological quality.
in preterm infants > 3 weeks with cld administration of a single dose of aerosolized furosemide improves pulmonary mechanics. in view of the lack of data from randomized trials concerning effects on important clinical outcomes, routine or sustained use of aerosolized loop diuretics in infants with (or developing) cld cannot be recommended based on current evidence. randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate clinically important effects of aerosolized diuretics.
limited data were available when considering the impact of galantamine on vascular dementia or vascular cognitive impairment. the data available suggest some advantage over placebo in the areas of cognition and global clinical state. in both included trials galantamine produced higher rates of gastrointestinal side-effects. more studies are needed before firm conclusions can be drawn.
it is difficult to draw any conclusions from this review, however, suggestions are made for methods of improving future research involving orthodontic adhesives.
there was consistent evidence from multiple trials that cognitive stimulation programmes benefit cognition in people with mild to moderate dementia over and above any medication effects. however, the trials were of variable quality with small sample sizes and only limited details of the randomisation method were apparent in a number of the trials. other outcomes need more exploration but improvements in self-reported quality of life and well-being were promising. further research should look into the potential benefits of longer term cognitive stimulation programmes and their clinical significance.
topical fluorides (mouthrinses, gels, or varnishes) used in addition to fluoride toothpaste achieve a modest reduction in caries compared to toothpaste used alone. no conclusions about any adverse effects could be reached, because data were scarcely reported in the trials.
high quality evidence suggests that there is no clinically relevant difference between smt and other interventions for reducing pain and improving function in patients with chronic low-back pain. determining cost-effectiveness of care has high priority. further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect in relation to inert interventions and sham smt, and data related to recovery.
there is a lack of robust, randomised, controlled evidence to support the choice of antiepileptic drug for the treatment of seizures in adults with brain tumours. while some authors support the use of non enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, reliable, comparative evidence to provide clinical justification for this is limited. there is a need for further large, randomised, controlled trials in this area.
in women undergoing surgery for benign ovarian tumours, laparoscopy was associated with a reduction in fever, urinary tract infection, postoperative complications, postoperative pain, number of days in hospital, and total cost. these findings should be interpreted with caution since only a small number of studies were identified. these included a total of only 769 women and not all of the important outcomes were reported in each study.
current evidence is insufficient to support the effectiveness of nutritional screening, although equally there is no evidence of no effect. therefore, more high quality studies should be conducted to assess the effectiveness of nutritional screening in different settings.
although urate oxidase might be effective in reducing serum uric acid, it is still unclear whether this translates into a reduction in mortality or renal failure. clinicians should weigh the potential benefits of reducing uric acid and uncertain benefits of preventing renal failure or mortality from tls against the potential risk of adverse effects.
the quality of the evidence was poor, but the findings suggest that the combination of antacids plus h2 antagonists was more effective than no intervention, and superior to antacids alone in preventing low gastric ph. however, none of the studies assessed potential adverse effects or substantive clinical outcomes. these findings are relevant for all women undergoing caesarean section under general anaesthesia.
we found no evidence that the topical administration of a short-acting sodium channel blocker improves respiratory condition in people with cystic fibrosis and some limited evidence of deterioration in lung function.
extended tip spatulas of various designs appear to be better for collecting endocervical cells than the commonly used ayre spatula. the most effective combination appears to be the cytobrush with an extended tip spatula. the rate of detection of endocervical cells appears to be a valid and convenient surrogate for the ability to detect dyskaryosis and for adequate smear rates. the ability of the extended tip spatula with the cytobrush compared with the extended tip spatula alone to detect disease, needs to be evaluated in a trial.
aliskiren has a dose-related blood pressure lowering effect better than placebo. this effect is similar to that determined for ace inhibitors and arbs.
there is no evidence, either supporting or refuting the use of bed rest at home or in hospital, to prevent preterm birth. although bed rest in hospital or at home is widely used as the first step of treatment, there is no evidence that this practice could be beneficial. due to the potential adverse effects that bed rest could have on women and their families, and the increased costs for the healthcare system, clinicians should not routinely advise women to rest in bed to prevent preterm birth. potential benefits and harms should be discussed with women facing an increased risk of preterm birth. appropriate research is mandatory. future trials should evaluate both the effectiveness of bed rest, and the effectiveness of the prescription of bed rest, to prevent preterm birth. [note: the two citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
there is a paucity of high quality trials evaluating interventions for acute otitis externa. the results of this systematic review are largely based on odds ratios calculated from single trials, most of which have very broad 95% confidence intervals because of small to modest sample sizes. the findings may not be wholly generalisable to primary care for a variety of reasons; only two of the 19 trials included in the review were conducted in a primary care population setting, and in 11 of the 19 trials ear cleaning formed part of the treatment (an intervention unlikely to be available in primary care). despite these reservations, some meaningful conclusions can be drawn from the evidence available: topical treatments alone, as distinct from systemic ones, are effective for uncomplicated acute otitis externa. in most cases the choice of topical intervention does not appear to influence the therapeutic outcome significantly. any observed differences in efficacy were usually minor and not consistently present at each follow-up visit. acetic acid was effective and comparable to antibiotic/steroid at week 1. however, when treatment needed to be extended beyond this point it was less effective. in addition, patient symptoms lasted two days longer in the acetic acid group compared to antibiotic/steroid. the evidence for steroid-only drops is very limited and as yet not robust enough to allow us to reach a conclusion or provide recommendations. further investigation is needed. given that most topical treatments are equally effective, it would appear that in most cases the preferred choice of topical treatment may be determined by other factors, such as risk of ototoxicity, risk of contact sensitivity, risk of developing resistance, availability, cost and dosing schedule. factors such as speed of healing and pain relief are yet to be determined for many topical treatments and may also influence this decision. patients prescribed antibiotic/steroid drops can expect their symptoms to last for approximately six days after treatment has begun. although patients are usually treated with topical medication for seven to 10 days it is apparent that this will undertreat some patients and overtreat others. it may be more useful when prescribing ear drops to instruct patients to use them for at least a week. if they have symptoms beyond the first week they should continue the drops until their symptoms resolve (and possibly for a few days after), for a maximum of a further seven days. patients with persisting symptoms beyond two weeks should be considered treatment failures and alternative management initiated.
the effects of dietary manipulation, including vegetarian, mediterranean, elemental and elimination diets, on rheumatoid arthritis are still uncertain due to the included studies being small, single trials with moderate to high risk of bias. higher drop-out rates and weight loss in the groups with dietary manipulation indicate that potential adverse effects should not be ignored.
there is some evidence to support the use of external fixation for dorsally displaced fractures of the distal radius in adults. though there is insufficient evidence to confirm a better functional outcome, external fixation reduces redisplacement, gives improved anatomical results and most of the excess surgically-related complications are minor.
on the basis of this one trial and subsequent analysis of data as reported by the authors, indomethacin cannot be recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate severity alzheimer's disease. at doses of 100-150 mg daily, serious side effects will limit its use.
although there was low quality evidence of improvement in some parameters with creatine, oral sucrose, ramipril and a carbohydrate rich diet, none was sufficiently strong to indicate significant clinical benefit.
in the included rcts there was no consistent evidence favouring either iv beta2-agonists or iv aminophylline for patients with acute asthma. the opportunity to draw clear conclusions is limited by the heterogeneity of outcomes evaluated and the small sample sizes in the included studies. it is recommended that these data should be viewed carefully alongside the conclusions from separate cochrane reviews comparing iv beta2-agonists plus inhaled beta2-agonists versus inhaled beta2-agonists alone and iv aminophylline plus inhaled beta2-agonists versus inhaled beta2-agonists alone.
there is weak evidence that regular planned recall of patients for appointments, structured monitoring of risk factors and prescribing, and education for patients can be effective in increasing the proportions of patients within target levels for cholesterol control and blood pressure. further research in this area would benefit from greater standardisation of the outcomes measured.
exercise seems to improve depressive symptoms in people with a diagnosis of depression when compared with no treatment or control intervention, however since analyses of methodologically robust trials show a much smaller effect in favour of exercise, some caution is required in interpreting these results.
because of the limitations of the studies it is not possible to draw conclusions for clinical practice. anyone introducing a system into practice should give careful consideration to conducting an evaluation using a robust design.
our systematic review establishes the effectiveness of topical and systemic lidocaine for the prevention of postoperative sore throat resulting from intubation. the risk and severity of postoperative sore throat tended to be reduced. the effect size of lidocaine appeared to be affected by drug concentration and route of administration; management of cuff pressure during anaesthesia; the included population; and the type of outcome measured.
there is evidence suggesting that treatment of a varicocele in men from couples with otherwise unexplained subfertility may improve a couple's chance of pregnancy. however, findings are inconclusive as the quality of the available evidence is very low and more research is needed with live birth or pregnancy rate as the primary outcome.
although ethosuximide, lamotrigine and valproate are commonly used to treat people with absence seizures we have insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice, and the few trials included in this review were of poor methodological quality and did not have sufficient number of participants. more trials of better quality are needed.
there is currently no evidence of benefit from corticosteroids, but the small number of participants means it is difficult to exclude an effect on death in either direction. data on clinical complications are difficult to assess.
people with amd may experience delay in progression of the disease with antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation. this finding is drawn from one large trial conducted in a relatively well-nourished american population. the generalisability of these findings to other populations is not known. although generally regarded as safe, vitamin supplements may have harmful effects. a systematic review of the evidence on harms of vitamin supplements is needed.
there are not sufficient data to determine the effect of vitamin d compounds on mortality and cardiovascular outcomes in people with ckd not requiring dialysis. while vitamin d compounds reduce serum pth (49.3 pg/ml (5.6 pmol/l)) compared with placebo, the relative clinical benefits of pth lowering versus treatment-related increases in serum phosphorus and calcium remain to be understood.
current evidence suggests that supplementary oxygen given to healthy term pregnant women during elective caesarean section under regional anaesthesia is associated with higher maternal and neonatal oxygen levels (maternal spo2, pao2, uapo2 and uvpo2) and higher levels of oxygen free radicals. however, the intervention was neither beneficial nor harmful to the neonate's short-term clinical outcome as assessed by apgar scores.
quinine loading dose reduced fever clearance time and parasite clearance time. data are insufficient to directly demonstrate an impact of loading dose on risk of death.
we found venom immunotherapy using extracted insect venom to be an effective therapy for preventing further allergic reactions to insect stings, which can improve quality of life. the treatment carries a small but significant risk of systemic adverse reaction.
current evidence does not support the routine use of rtms for the treatment of stroke. further trials with larger sample sizes are needed to determine a suitable rtms protocol and the long-term functional outcome.
based on the studies carried out so far, the efficacy of aspirin, steroid and nsaids (traditional nsaids and cox-2 inhibitors) is not proven. therefore, these drugs cannot be recommended for the treatment of ad.
there is good evidence that both ert and hrt do not prevent cognitive decline in older postmenopausal women when given as short term or longer term (up to five years) therapy. it is not known whether either specific types of ert or hrt have specific effects in subgroups of women, although there was evidence that combined hormone therapy in similarly aged women was associated with a decrement in a number of verbal memory tests and a small improvement in a test of figural memory. there is insufficient evidence to determine whether subgroups of women using specific types of hormone therapy could benefit from treatment. it remains to be determined whether factors such as younger age (< 60 years of age), type of menopause (surgical or natural) and type of treatment (type of estrogen with or without a progestagen), mode of delivery (transdermal, oral or intramuscular) and dosage have positive effects at a clinically relevant level. in addition, whether the absence or presence of menopausal symptoms can modify treatment effects should be investigated in more detail. large rcts currently underway in the usa may be able to provide answers to these uncertainties by the year 2010. in the meantime, based on the available evidence, ert or hrt cannot be recommended for overall cognitive improvement or maintenance in older postmenopausal women without cognitive impairment.
calcitonin appears to preserve bone mass in the first year of glucocorticoid therapy at the lumbar spine by about 3% compared to placebo, but not at the femoral neck. our analysis suggests that the protective effect on bone mass may be greater for the treatment of patients who have been taking corticosteroids for more than three months. efficacy of calcitonin for fracture prevention in steroid-induced osteoporosis remains to be established.
oral ondansetron increased the proportion of patients who had ceased vomiting and reduced the number needing intravenous rehydration and immediate hospital admission. intravenous ondansetron and metoclopramide reduced the number of episodes of vomiting and hospital admission, and dimenhydrinate as a suppository reduced the duration of vomiting.
there is some evidence of a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation, weaning duration and icu los with use of standardized protocols, but there is significant heterogeneity among studies and an insufficient number of studies to investigate the source of this heterogeneity. although some study authors suggest that organizational context may influence outcomes, these factors were not considered in all included studies and therefore could not be evaluated.
well designed rcts, evaluating a high number of patients were included in the review. recombinant ifn beta does not prevent the development of permanent physical disability in spms. we were unable to verify the effect on cognitive function for the lack of comparable data. this treatment significantly reduces the risk of relapse and of short -term relapse-related disability. overall, these results show that ifns' anti-inflammatory effect is unable to retard progression, when established. in the future, no new rcts for ifns versus placebo in spms will probably be undertaken, because research is now focusing on innovative drugs. we believe that this review gives conclusive evidence on the clinical efficacy of ifns versus placebo in spms.
haloperidol is a potent antipsychotic drug but has a high propensity to cause adverse effects. where there is no treatment option, use of haloperidol to counter the damaging and potentially dangerous consequences of untreated schizophrenia is justified. however, where a choice of drug is available, people with schizophrenia and clinicians may wish to prescribe an alternative antipsychotic with less likelihood of adverse effects such as parkinsonism, akathisia and acute dystonias. haloperidol should not be a control drug of choice for randomised trials of new antipsychotics.
treatment with rhu epo in pre-dialysis patients corrects anaemia, avoids the requirement for blood transfusions and also improves quality of life and exercise capacity. we were unable to assess the effects of rhu epo on progression of renal disease, delay in the onset of dialysis or adverse events. based on the current evidence, decisions on the putative benefits in terms of quality of life are worth the extra costs of pre-dialysis rhu epo need careful evaluation.
a single, non-randomised, poorly reported trial of vitamin c as a treatment for tetanus suggests a considerable reduction in mortality. however, concerns about trial quality mean that this result must be interpreted with caution and that vitamin c cannot be recommended as a treatment for tetanus on the basis of this evidence. new trials should be carried out to examine the effect of vitamin c on tetanus treatment.
using a more conservative statistical approach, combination treatments were superior to single psychotherapy. this was the only statistically significant difference between treatments. the number of trials might be insufficient to show the statistical significance of a 19% absolute risk reduction in efficacy favouring psychotherapy or combination treatments over single antidepressants. psychotherapy appeared to be more acceptable to subjects. when antidepressants were combined with psychological treatments, acceptability of the latter was significantly reduced.
further research examining the effectiveness of family therapy versus a no-treatment control condition is needed to determine whether family therapy is an effective intervention for children with adhd. there were no results available from studies investigating forms of family therapy other than behavioural family therapy.
paracetamol is a safe, effective drug for the treatment of postoperative pain following the surgical removal of lower wisdom teeth.
telehealthcare in copd appears to have a possible impact on the quality of life of patients and the number of times patients attend the emergency department and the hospital. however, further research is needed to clarify precisely its role since the trials included telehealthcare as part of more complex packages.
the results of one well designed study using lenalidomide did not show any statistically significant benefit over placebo. the use of thalidomide or lenalidomide for induction of remission in crohn's disease is not recommended until data from a definitive study are available.
the available data from the trials suggest that there is little difference between regular long term use of ipb alone and salmeterol if the aim is to improve copd symptoms and exercise tolerance. however, salmeterol was more effective in improving lung function variables. in terms of post-bronchodilator lung function, combination therapy conferred modest benefits, a significant improvement in hrql, and reduced supplemental short-acting beta-agonist requirement, although this effect was not consistent. additional studies are needed to assess the relative effects of combining therapies, using validated subjective measurements, and should consider concordance and the convenience of people having to use different inhaler devices.
the evidence suggests that the optimal duration of antithyroid drug therapy for the titration regimen is 12 to 18 months. the titration (low dose) regimen had fewer adverse effects than the block-replace (high dose) regimen and was no less effective. continued thyroxine treatment following initial antithyroid therapy does not appear to provide any benefit in terms of recurrence of hyperthyroidism. immunosuppressive therapies need further evaluation.
this review was unable to draw firm conclusions for the role of psychological interventions in asthma due to the absence of an adequate evidence base. larger, well-conducted and reported randomised trials are required in this area, in order to determine the effects of these techniques in the treatment of asthma in adults.
due to the paucity of available evidence, it is not possible to provide firm conclusions as to the effects of tartrazine on asthma control. however, the six rcts that could be included in this review all arrived at the same conclusion. routine tartrazine exclusion may not benefit most patients, except those very few individuals with proven sensitivity.
shouldice herniorrhaphy is the best non-mesh technique in terms of recurrence, though it is more time consuming and needs a slightly longer post-operative hospital stay. the use of mesh is associated with a lower rate of recurrence. the quality of included studies, assessed with jaded scale, were low. patients have similar characteristic in the treatment and control group but seems more healthy than in general population, this features may affect the dimension of effect in particularly recurrence rate could be higher in general population. lost to follow-up were similar in the treatment and control group but the reasons were often not reported. the length of follow-up vary broadly among the studies from 1 year to 13.7 year.
the failure of vitamin c supplementation to reduce the incidence of colds in the general population indicates that routine vitamin c supplementation is not justified, yet vitamin c may be useful for people exposed to brief periods of severe physical exercise. regular supplementation trials have shown that vitamin c reduces the duration of colds, but this was not replicated in the few therapeutic trials that have been carried out. nevertheless, given the consistent effect of vitamin c on the duration and severity of colds in the regular supplementation studies, and the low cost and safety, it may be worthwhile for common cold patients to test on an individual basis whether therapeutic vitamin c is beneficial for them. further therapeutic rcts are warranted.
the data do not allow firm conclusions about the effectiveness of acupuncture for acute low-back pain. for chronic low-back pain, acupuncture is more effective for pain relief and functional improvement than no treatment or sham treatment immediately after treatment and in the short-term only. acupuncture is not more effective than other conventional and "alternative" treatments. the data suggest that acupuncture and dry-needling may be useful adjuncts to other therapies for chronic low-back pain. because most of the studies were of lower methodological quality, there certainly is a further need for higher quality trials in this area.
laparoscopic surgery for small bowel cd may be as safe as the open operation. there was no significant difference in the perioperative outcomes and the long term reoperation rates for disease-related or non-disease related complications of cd.
treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with metalloporphyrins may reduce neonatal bilirubin levels and decrease the need for phototherapy and hospitalization. there is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that treatment with a metalloporphyrin decreases the risk of neonatal kernicterus or of long-term neurodevelopmental impairment due to bilirubin encephalopathy. there is no evidence to support or refute the possibility that cutaneous photosensitivity is increased with metalloporphyrin treatment. routine treatment of neonatal unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia with a metalloporphyrin cannot be recommended at present.
limited evidence is available for the effectiveness of interventions to reduce stress levels in healthcare workers. larger and better quality trials are needed.
current evidence shows significant short-term benefit from oral steroids, splinting, ultrasound, yoga and carpal bone mobilisation. other non-surgical treatments do not produce significant benefit. more trials are needed to compare treatments and ascertain the duration of benefit.
once- and three-times daily aminoglycoside antibiotics appear to be equally effective in the treatment of pulmonary exacerbations of cystic fibrosis. there is evidence of less nephrotoxicity in children.
this review highlights the dearth of evidence investigating long-term therapy-based rehabilitation interventions for patients with stroke.
duloxetine did not seem to provide a significant advantage in efficacy over other antidepressive agents for the acute-phase treatment of major depression. no differences in terms of efficacy were found, even though duloxetine was worse than some ssris (most of all, escitalopram) and newer antidepressants (like venlafaxine) in terms of acceptability and tolerability. unfortunately, we only found evidence comparing duloxetine with a handful of other active antidepressive agents and only a few trials per comparison were found (in some cases we retrieved just one trial). this limited the power of the review to detect moderate, but clinically meaningful differences between the drugs. as many statistical tests have been used in the review, the findings from this review are better thought of as hypothesis forming rather than hypothesis testing and it would be very comforting to see the conclusions replicated in future trials. most of included studies were sponsored by the drug industry manufacturing duloxetine. as for all other new investigational compounds, the potential for overestimation of treatment effect due to sponsorship bias should be borne in mind. in the present review no trials reported economic outcomes. given that several ssris and the great majority of antidepressants are now available as generic formulation (only escitalopram, desvenlafaxine and duloxetine are still on patent), more comprehensive economic estimates of antidepressant treatment effect should be considered to better inform healthcare policy.
the lack of effect on maternal and infant mortality and morbidity, with exception of some improved infant morbidity in one small study, and the improvement in maternal vitamin a status, suggest that maternal postpartum vitamin a supplementation offers limited benefits.
only pharmacological interventions were included and none proved to be effective as a disease-modifying therapy for hd. further trials with greater methodological quality should be conducted using more sensitive biological markers. pre-symptomatic mutation carriers should be included in future studies.
currently available evidence from rcts does not support prophylactic antibiotic use in patients with bsf, whether there is evidence of csf leakage or not. until more research is completed, the effectiveness of antibiotics in patients with bsf cannot be determined because studies published to date are flawed by biases. large, appropriately designed rcts are needed.
currently, there is no clear evidence for any intervention offering significant benefits in the reduction of bacterial infections and wound complications in liver transplantation. selective bowel decontamination increases the risk of infection and hospital stay compared to prebiotics and probiotics. the use of prebiotics and probiotics offers promise. further randomised clinical trials are necessary.
the available evidence does not support the use of many red flags to specifically screen for vertebral fracture in patients presenting for lbp. based on evidence from single studies, few individual red flags appear informative as most have poor diagnostic accuracy as indicated by imprecise estimates of likelihood ratios. when combinations of red flags were used the performance appeared to improve. from the limited evidence, the findings give rise to a weak recommendation that a combination of a small subset of red flags may be useful to screen for vertebral fracture. it should also be noted that many red flags have high false positive rates; and if acted upon uncritically there would be consequences for the cost of management and outcomes of patients with lbp. further research should focus on appropriate sets of red flags and adequate reporting of both index and reference tests.
based on limited data, azithromycin or clarithromycin appeared to be a prophylactic agent of choice for mac infection. further studies are needed, especially direct comparison of clarithromycin and azithromycin. in additions, studies that will compare different doses and regimens are needed.
methyldopa lowers blood pressure to varying degrees compared to placebo for patients with primary hypertension. its effect on clinical outcomes, however, remains uncertain.
there is still lack of strong evidence for an optimal dose for clinical practice. the quality of trials suggests that an over estimate of effect is likely and we think this is most probably for the mid-range doses. one such dose (standard-lower dose range, 4-<6 mg/day) does seem optimal for clinical response and adverse effects. weak evidence suggests that low doses (≧2-<4 mg/day) may be of value for people in their first episode of illness. high doses (≧10 mg/day) did not confer any advantage over any other dose ranges and caused more adverse effects, especially for movement disorders. ultra low dose (<2 mg/day) seemed useless. we advise the use of dosages from low dose to standard-lower dose for different kinds of individual patients. future trials should focus on specific populations, e.g. those in their first episode, with acute exacerbation, in relapse or refractory to treatment, and should also test the optimal dose of risperidone over a longer period of time and in the community.
currently there are no indications for igg in the prophylaxis of cmv disease in recipients of solid organ transplants.
there is currently only one randomised controlled trial evaluating the effects of high versus low dose of initial thyroid hormone replacement for cht. there is inadequate evidence to suggest that a high dose is more beneficial compared to a low dose initial thyroid hormone replacement in the treatment of cht.
there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of stress management training interventions to reduce job stress and prevent burnout among healthcare workers beyond the intervention period. low quality evidence suggests that longer-term interventions with refresher or booster sessions may have more sustained positive effect, but this needs to be rigorously evaluated in further trials. low quality evidence exists to show that management interventions may improve some measures of job satisfaction. however, further trials are needed to assess whether this finding is replicable in other settings. there was insufficient evidence of the benefit of management interventions on staff absenteeism. rigorous trials are needed to assess the effects of longer-term stress management training and management interventions in primary care and developing country settings.
despite evidence from a small number of individual studies to suggest that emg-bfb plus standard physiotherapy produces improvements in motor power, functional recovery and gait quality when compared to standard physiotherapy alone, combination of all the identified studies did not find a treatment benefit. overall the results are limited because the trials were small, generally poorly designed and utilised varying outcome measures.
there is insufficient good quality evidence to make recommendations about the relative effect of simultaneous bilateral training compared to placebo, no intervention or usual care. we identified evidence that suggests that bilateral training may be no more (or less) effective than usual care or other upper limb interventions for performance in adl, functional movement of the upper limb or motor impairment outcomes.
there are insufficient data to recommend beta-blocking drugs for akathisia. these drugs are experimental for this problem, and this review highlights the need for more evaluative studies.
methadone dosages ranging from 60 to 100 mg/day are more effective than lower dosages in retaining patients and in reducing use of heroin and cocaine during treatment. to find the optimal dose is a clinical ability, but clinician must consider these conclusions in treatment strategies.
both danazol and progesterone + oestrogen add-back have been shown to be protective of bmd, while on treatment and up to six and 12 months later, respectively. however, by 24 months of follow-up there was no difference in bmd in those women who had hrt add-back. studies of danazol versus gnrha did not report long-term follow-up. the significant side effects associated with danazol limit its use.
the most suitable method for milk expression may depend on the time since birth, purpose of expression and the individual mother and infant. low cost interventions including early initiation when not feeding at the breast, relaxation, hand expression and lower cost pumps may be as effective, or more effective, than large electric pumps for some outcomes. small sample sizes, large standard deviations, small number of studies reviewed, and the diversity of the interventions argue caution in applying these results beyond the specific method tested in the specific settings.
this review has found evidence to support the role of laparoscopy for the management of early endometrial cancer. for presumed early stage primary endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the endometrium, laparoscopy is associated with similar overall and disease-free survival. laparoscopy is associated with reduced operative morbidity and hospital stay. there is no significant difference in severe post-operative morbidity between the two modalities.
the available evidence base remains insufficient to guide practice. in addition, the finding that placebo saline injection was followed by a similar symptomatic improvement to bulking agent injection raises questions about the mechanism of any beneficial effects. one small trial comparing silicone particles with pelvic floor muscle training was suggestive of benefit at three months but it is not known if this was sustained, and the treatment was associated with high levels of postoperative retention and dysuria. greater symptomatic improvement was observed with surgical treatments, though the advantages need to be set against likely higher risks. no clear-cut conclusions could be drawn from trials comparing alternative agents, although dextranomer hyaluronic acid was associated with more local side effects and is no longer commercially available for this indication. there is insufficient evidence to show superiority of mid-urethral or bladder neck injection. the single trial of autologous fat provides a reminder that periurethral injections can occasionally cause serious side effects.
there are insufficient data from trials to recommend any change in clinical practice. available data should, however, encourage further work to address the safety of more conservative policies of hospitalisation for women with suspected placenta praevia, and the possible value of insertion of a cervical suture. [note: the six citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
one cluster-rct provides limited evidence that a live-attenuated vaccine is effective in preventing cutaneous anthrax. vaccines based on anthrax antigens are immunogenic in most vaccinees with few adverse events or reactions. ongoing randomized controlled trials are investigating the immunogenicity and safety of anthrax vaccines.
the results of our review suggest that there is an overall survival benefit for intensifying the follow up of patients after curative surgery for colorectal cancer. because of the wide variation in the follow-up programmes used in the included studies it is not possible to infer from the data the best combination and frequency of clinic (or family practice) visits, blood tests, endoscopic procedures and radiological investigations to maximise the outcomes for these patients. nor is it possible to estimate the potential harms or costs of intensifying follow up for these patients in order to adopt a cost-effective approach in this clinical area. large clinical trials underway or about to commence are likely to contribute valuable further information to clarify these areas of clinical uncertainty.
the results of this meta-analysis would suggest that pd is the more effective endoscopic treatment in the long term (greater than six months) for patients with achalasia.
there is limited evidence which supports the use of compensatory scanning training for patients with visual field defects (and possibly co-existing visual neglect) to improve scanning and reading outcomes. there is insufficient evidence to reach a conclusion about the impact of compensatory scanning training on functional activities of daily living. there is insufficient evidence to reach generalised conclusions about the benefits of visual restitution training (vrt) (restitutive intervention) or prisms (substitutive intervention) for patients with visual field defects after stroke.
there is no high-quality research evidence evaluating complex interventions for preventing diabetic foot ulceration and insufficient evidence of benefit.
the available evidence suggests that use of high-carbohydrate, high-protein, low-fat enteral feeds in patients with at least 10% tbsa burns might reduce the incidence of pneumonia compared with use of a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet. the available evidence is inconclusive regarding the effect of either enteral feeding regimen on mortality. note that the available evidence is limited to two small studies judged to be of moderate risk of bias. further research is needed in this area before strong conclusions can be drawn.
limited evidence from randomised controlled trials suggests that corticosteroid treatment offers short-term benefit in myasthenia gravis compared with placebo. this supports the conclusions of observational studies and expert opinion. limited evidence from randomised controlled trials does not show any difference in efficacy between corticosteroids and either azathioprine or intravenous immunoglobulin.
combination cisplatin-based chemotherapy could be a viable option for patients of good performance status with recurrent/metastatic cervical cancer, but further trials that report adequate survival and qol data are sought. response rates and improvements in survival are low. cisplatin-based combinations have significant toxicity. outcomes are poor and novel cytotoxic/biological agents and optimal scheduling need further investigation. future trials need to stratify for and perform planned subgroup analysis with respect to previous treatment and site of recurrence.
the best evidence suggests that newer treatments including terbinafine, itraconazole and fluconazole may be similar to griseofulvin in children with tinea capitis caused by trichophyton species. newer treatments may be preferred because shorter treatment durations may improve treatment adherence, although they may be more expensive. there is not enough evidence on the use of systemic treatments in children with microsporum infections. not all treatments for tinea capitis are available in paediatric formulations but all have reasonable safety profiles.
universal initial treatment with either surgery or thrombolysis cannot be advocated on the available evidence. there is no overall difference in limb salvage or death at one year between initial surgery and initial thrombolysis. thrombolysis may be associated with a higher risk of ongoing limb ischaemia and haemorrhagic complications including stroke. the higher risk of complications must be balanced against risks of surgery in each person.
although topical steroids are considered to be first line treatment, we identified no rcts that compared steroids with placebo in patients with symptomatic olp. from the trials in this review there is no evidence that one steroid is any more effective than another. there is weak evidence that aloe vera may reduce the pain of olp and improve the clinical signs of disease compared to placebo. there is weak and unreliable evidence that cyclosporin may reduce pain and clinical signs of olp. there is no evidence that other calcineurin inhibitors reduce pain compared to either steroids or placebo. from the 28 trials included in this systematic review, the wide range of interventions compared means there is insufficient evidence to support the effectiveness of any specific treatment as being superior.
there is insufficient evidence to support the use of chloroquine as an oral steroid-sparing agent in chronic asthma. further trials should optimise oral steroid dosage before addition of the steroid-sparing agent.
evidence suggests that oral antibiotics reduce the incidence of nec in low birth weight infants. however concerns about adverse outcomes persist, particularly related to the development of resistant bacteria. to address this question further, a large trial would be required with a sample size sufficient to examine all the important benefits and harms. adverse outcomes associated with infection should be evaluated, and microbiological studies looking for the development of resistant bacteria should be undertaken
we found no evidence of a difference in mortality, 'clinically significant' or 'severe bleeding', transfusion reactions or adverse events between pathogen-reduced and standard platelets. for a range of laboratory outcomes the results indicated evidence of some benefits for standard platelets over pathogen-reduced platelets. these conclusions are based on data from 1422 patients included in 10 trials. results from ongoing or new trials are required to determine if there are clinically important differences in bleeding risk between pathogen-reduced platelet transfusions and standard platelet transfusions. given the variability in trial design, bleeding assessment and quality of outcome reporting, it is recommended that future trials apply standardised approaches to outcome assessment and follow-up, including safety reporting.
we found only one rct, with a moderate risk of bias, which showed that providing pep support by phone calls did not result in higher adherence to pep. however, the rct was conducted in an upper-middle-income country with high hiv prevalence, on a high-risk population and the applicability of its results on other settings and contexts is unclear. there is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of using phone calls for providing pep support and for other hiv prevention interventions.
there is no evidence from randomised trials to suggest that any antibiotic regimen may be better than any other in the treatment of presumed early neonatal sepsis. more studies are needed to resolve this issue.
only one rct of treatment for amphetamine psychosis has been published. outcomes from this trial indicate that antipsychotic medications effectively reduce symptoms of amphetamine psychosis, the newer generation and more expensive antipsychotic medication, olanzapine, demonstrates significantly better tolerability than the more affordable and commonly used medication, haloperidol. there are other two studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria for this review. the results of these two studies show that agitation and some psychotic symptoms may be abated within an hour after antipsychotic injection. whether this limited evidence can be applied for amphetamine psychotic patients is not yet known. the medications that should be further investigate are conventional antipsychotics, newer antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. however, naturalistic studies of amphetamine psychotic symptoms and the prevalence of relapse to psychosis in the presence of amphetamine, are also crucial for advising the development of study designs appropriate for further treatment studies of amphetamine psychosis.
this review did not find any evidence that dietary sodium reduction significantly improves asthma control. although dietary sodium reduction may result in improvements in lung function in exercise-induced asthma, the clinical significance of this effect is unclear.
although intravenous doxapram might reduce apnea within the first 48 hours of treatment, there are insufficient data to evaluate the precision of this result or to assess potential adverse effects. no long-term outcomes have been measured. further studies are needed to determine the role of this treatment in clinical practice.
there is limited evidence, from single trials only, regarding the effectiveness of different methods of surgical fixation of fractures and non-union of the middle third of the clavicle.
there is not sufficient evidence to state that the occlusal splint is effective for treating sleep bruxism. indication of its use is questionable with regard to sleep outcomes, but it may be that there is some benefit with regard to tooth wear. this systematic review suggests the need for further investigation in more controlled rcts that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and sufficient duration of follow up. the study design must be parallel, in order to eliminate the bias provided by studies of cross-over type. a standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of sleep bruxism should be established in the rcts.
subcutaneous unfractionated heparin for the treatment of venous thromboembolism cannot be considered non-inferior to other treatment modalities in terms of recurrent dvt and pe at three months, but seems as safe and effective with regards to rates of major bleeding and death.
the evidence is inconclusive to allow us to make any recommendations for interpersonal psychotherapy for the treatment of antenatal depression. the one trial included was too small, with a non-generalisable sample, to make any recommendations. [note: the 12 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
based on current evidence from small pilot trials, there are too few data to be able to say whether remote ischaemic preconditioning has any beneficial or harmful effects. the safety of this technique needs to be confirmed in adequately powered trials. therefore, further randomised trials on this technique are required.
there is no evidence that the use of perioperative local anaesthetic in patients undergoing tonsillectomy improves post-operative pain control. the trials identified were of small size and several involved the perioperative co-administration of intravenous opiates which may have masked any beneficial effect of the local anaesthetic. further randomised controlled trials are necessary.
we found only one eligible study. although this study showed the use of the telephone for hiv test results notification was more effective than face-to-face delivery, it had a high-risk of bias. the study was conducted about 13 years ago in a high-income country, on a high-risk population, with low hiv prevalence, and the applicability of its results to other settings and contexts is unclear. the study did not provide information about telephone hiv test results notification of hiv positive people since none of the intervention group participants were hiv positive. we found no information about the acceptability of the intervention to patients’ and providers’, its economic outcomes or potential adverse effects. there is a need for robust evidence from various settings on the effectiveness of telephone use for hiv test results notification.
es was shown to have a clinically beneficial effect on grip strength and fatigue resistance for ra patients with muscle atrophy of the hand. however, these conclusions are limited by the low methodological quality of the trial included. more well-designed studies are therefore needed to provide further evidence of the benefits of es in the management of ra.
ebrt reduces the risk of locoregional recurrence but has no significant impact on cancer-related deaths or overall survival. it is associated with significant morbidity and a reduction in quality of life. there is no demonstrable survival advantage from adjuvant ebrt for high-risk stage i endometrial cancer, however, the meta-analyses of this subgroup were underpowered and also included high-intermediate risk women, therefore we cannot exclude a small benefit in the high-risk subgroup. ebrt may have an adverse effect on endometrial cancer survival when used to treat uncomplicated low-risk (ia/b grade 1/2) endometrial cancer. for the intermediate to high-intermediate risk group, vbt alone appears to be adequate in ensuring vaginal control compared to ebrt. further research is needed to guide practice for lesions that are truly high risk. in addition, the definitions of risk should be standardised.
there is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice on the benefits and harms of immediate delivery compared with expectant management for women with pprom. to date all of the clinical trials have had methodological weaknesses and have been underpowered to detect meaningful measures of infant and maternal morbidity.
available evidence regarding cognitive training remains limited, and the quality of the evidence needs to improve. however, there is still no indication of any significant benefit derived from cognitive training. trial reports indicate that some gains resulting from intervention may not be captured adequately by available standardised outcome measures. the results of the single rct of cognitive rehabilitation show promise but are preliminary in nature. further, well-designed studies of cognitive training and cognitive rehabilitation are required to obtain more definitive evidence. researchers should describe and classify their interventions appropriately using available terminology.
results are inconclusive with most outcomes being either non-significant or producing contradictory findings. currently, adjunctive dhea should remain an experimental treatment for people with schizophrenia.
the results indicate evidence for the effectiveness of mirror therapy for improving upper extremity motor function, activities of daily living and pain, at least as an adjunct to normal rehabilitation for patients after stroke. limitations are due to small sample sizes of most included studies, control interventions that are not used routinely in stroke rehabilitation and some methodological limitations of the studies.
the included studies do not provide sufficient detail about the harms and benefits of treating covert bacteriuria to enable formation of reliable conclusions. it appears that antibiotic treatment for covert bacteriuria is unlikely to benefit children in the long term.
the snris duloxetine and milnacipran provided a small incremental benefit over placebo in reducing pain. the superiority of duloxetine and milnacipran over placebo in reducing fatigue and limitations of qol was not substantial. duloxetine and milnacipran were not superior to placebo in reducing sleep problems. the dropout rates due to adverse events were higher for duloxetine and milnacipran than for placebo. the most frequently reported symptoms leading to stopping medication were nausea, dry mouth, constipation, headache, somnolence/dizziness and insomnia. rare complications of both drugs may include suicidality, liver damage, abnormal bleeding, elevated blood pressure and urinary hesitation.
vns for partial seizures appears to be an effective and well tolerated treatment. adverse effects of hoarseness, cough, pain, paresthesias, and dyspnea are associated with the treatment but appear to be reasonably well tolerated as dropouts were rare. typical central nervous system adverse effects of antiepileptic drugs such as ataxia, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, and somnolence were not statistically significantly associated with vns treatment.
both arthroscopy and nonsurgical treatments reduced pain after 6 months. when compared with arthroscopy, open surgery was more effective at reducing pain after 12 months. nevertheless, there were no differences in mandibular functionality or in other outcomes in clinical evaluations. arthroscopy led to greater improvement in maximum interincisal opening after 12 months than arthrocentesis; however, there was no difference in pain.
there is insufficient evidence to support the use of herbal medicines in hiv-infected individuals and aids patients. potential beneficial effects need to be confirmed in large, rigorous trials.
the included studies were of limited applicability to clinical practice. however, the findings indicate that music therapy may help children with autistic spectrum disorder to improve their communicative skills. more research is needed to examine whether the effects of music therapy are enduring, and to investigate the effects of music therapy in typical clinical practice.
primary radiotherapy to the groin results in less morbidity but may be associated with a higher risk of groin recurrence and decreased survival when compared with surgery. due to the small numbers in this trial and criticisms regarding the depth of radiotherapy applied, corroboration of these findings by larger rcts using a standardised radiotherapy method, is desirable. however, until better evidence is available, surgery should be considered the first choice treatment for the groin nodes in women with vulvar cancer. individual patients not physically able to withstand surgery may be treated with primary radiotherapy.
nrt appears to be a safe and effective intervention for the treatment of chronic non-specific lbp. the efficacy is less clear for sub-acute lbp. however, these results are limited to three trials conducted by a small number of specifically trained and experienced clinicians, in a limited geographical location. no data are available on the ease and time-frame needed to achieve that level of expertise. rcts by other practitioners, in other locations, that replicate the effects reported in this review are needed before recommending a broader practice.
problems following abi vary. consequently, different interventions and combinations of interventions are required to suit the needs of patients with different problems. patients presenting acutely to hospital with moderate to severe brain injury should be routinely followed up to assess their needs for rehabilitation. intensive intervention appears to lead to earlier gains. the balance between intensity and cost-effectiveness has yet to be determined. patients discharged from in-patient rehabilitation should have access to out-patient or community-based services appropriate to their needs. those with milder brain injury benefit from follow up and appropriate information and advice. not all questions in rehabilitation can be addressed by randomised controlled trials or other experimental approaches. some questions include which treatments work best for which patients over the long term, and which models of service represent value for money in the context of life-long care. in future, such questions will need to be set alongside practice-based evidence gathered from large systematic, longitudinal cohort studies conducted in the context of routine clinical practice.
from the single, small and ill-reported, included study, the hostel ward type of facility appeared cheaper and positively effective. currently, the value of this way of supporting people - which could be considerable - is unclear. trials are needed. any 24 hour care 'ward-in-a-house' is likely to be oversubscribed. we argue that the only equitable way of providing care in this way is to draw lots as to who is allocated a place from the eligible group of people with serious mental illness. with follow-up of all eligible for the placements - those who were lucky enough to be allocated a place as well as people in more standard type of care - real-world evaluation could take place. in the uk further randomised control trials are probably impossible, as many of these types of facilities have closed. the broader lesson of this review is to ensure early and rigorous evaluation of fashionable innovations before they are superseded by new approaches.
insufficient evidence exists for the safety or efficacy of naloxone or nalbuphine in the treatment of obd. long-term efficacy and safety of any of the opioid antagonists is unknown, as is the incidence or nature of rare adverse events. alvimopan and methylnaltrexone both show promise in treating obd, but further data will be required to fully assess their place in therapy.
in preterm infants with respiratory distress the application of cdp either as cpap or cnp is associated with reduced respiratory failure and reduced mortality. cdp is associated with an increased rate of pneumothorax. four out of six of these trials were done in the 1970's. therefore, the applicability of these results to current practice is difficult to assess. where resources are limited, such as in developing countries, cpap for rds may have a clinical role. further research is required to determine the best mode of administration and the role of cdp in modern intensive care settings
we identified insufficient high-quality evidence to reach any generalised conclusions about the effect of cognitive rehabilitation on executive function, or other secondary outcome measures. further high-quality research comparing cognitive rehabilitation with no intervention, placebo or sensorimotor interventions is recommended.
the meta-analysis confirmed the beneficial effect of anti-platelet treatment as an adjuvant used to increase the patency of a-v fistulae and grafts in the short term.
there is insufficient evidence to support the use of troleandomycin in the treatment of steroid dependent asthma.
this review has shown that routine pre-operative testing does not increase the safety of cataract surgery. alternatives to routine preoperative medical testing have been proposed, including self-administered health questionnaires, which could substitute for health provider histories and physical examinations. such avenues may lead to cost-effective means of identifying those at increased risk of medical adverse events due to cataract surgery. however, despite the rare occurrence, adverse medical events precipitated by cataract surgery remain a concern because of the large number of elderly patients with multiple medical comorbidities who have cataract surgery in various settings. the studies summarized in this review should assist recommendations for the standard of care of cataract surgery, at least in developed settings. unfortunately, in developing country settings, medical history questionnaires would be useless to screen for risk since few people have ever been to a physician, let alone been diagnosed with any chronic disease.
results from four randomised controlled clinical trials suggest that rhtsh is as effective as thw on iodine-131 thyroid remnant ablation, with limited data on significant benefits in decreased whole body radiation exposure and health-related quality of life. it is still uncertain whether lower iodine-131 doses (1110 mbq or 1850 mbq versus 3700 mbq) are equally effective for remnant ablation under rhtsh stimulation. randomised controlled clinical trials are needed to guide treatment selection for metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer.
there is no evidence that pharmacological cardioversion of atrial fibrillation to sinus rhythm is superior to rate control. rhythm control is associated with more adverse effects and increased hospitalisation. it does not reduce the risk of stroke. the conclusions cannot be generalised to all people with atrial fibrillation. most of the patients included in these studies were relatively older (>60 years) with significant cardiovascular risk factors.
overall there has been very little good quality research on treatments for bcc. most trials have only evaluated bccs in low risk locations. surgery and radiotherapy appear to be the most effective treatments with surgery showing the lowest failure rates. although cosmetic outcomes appear good with pdt, long-term follow-up data are needed. other treatments might have some use but few have been compared to surgery. an ongoing study comparing imiquimod to surgery should clarify whether imiquimod is a useful option.
available evidence supports the implementation of immunisation practices on women of childbearing age or pregnant women in communities with similar, or higher, levels of risk of neonatal tetanus, to the two study sites. more information is needed on possible interference of vaccination by malaria chemoprophylaxis on the roles of malnutrition and vitamin a deficiency, and on the quality of tetanus toxoid production and storage.
tranexamic acid decreases postpartum blood loss after vaginal birth and after caesarean section based on two rcts of unclear quality which reported on only a few outcomes. further investigations are needed to confirm efficacy and safety of this regimen for preventing pph. these results also provide a basis for the investigation of tranexamic acid for the treatment of pph.
the studies are limited by their quality with only two studies reporting details of both computerised randomisation techniques and adequate allocation concealment. ultrasound guidance does appear to improve the chances of live/ongoing and clinical pregnancies compared with clinical touch methods. the quality of future studies should be improved with adequate reporting of randomisation, allocation concealment, and power calculations. the primary outcome measure of future studies should be the reporting of live births per woman randomised.
high-dose methylprednisolone steroid therapy is the only pharmacologic therapy shown to have efficacy in a phase three randomized trial when administered within eight hours of injury. one trial indicates additional benefit by extending the maintenance dose from 24 to 48 hours, if start of treatment must be delayed to between three and eight hours after injury. there is an urgent need for more randomized trials of pharmacologic therapy for acute spinal cord injury.
we are not able to favour either epirubicin or doxorubicin when given with the same dose. based on the currently available evidence on heart failure, we conclude that in adults with a solid tumour liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin should be favoured over doxorubicin. for both epirubicin versus doxorubicin and liposomal-encapsulated doxorubicin versus conventional doxorubicin no conclusions can be made about the effects of treatment in children treated with anthracyclines and also not in patients diagnosed with leukaemia. more research is needed. for other combinations of anthracycline derivates not enough evidence was available to make definitive conclusions about the occurrence of cardiotoxicity in patients treated with anthracyclines.
current evidence does not support routine use of intravenous magnesium sulfate in all patients with acute asthma presenting to the emergency department. magnesium sulfate appears to be safe and beneficial in patients who present with severe acute asthma.
alarm interventions are an effective treatment for nocturnal bedwetting in children. alarms appear more effective than desmopressin or tricyclics because around half the children remain dry after alarm treatment stops. overlearning (giving extra fluids at bedtime after successfully becoming dry using an alarm), dry bed training and avoiding penalties may further reduce the relapse rate. better quality research comparing alarms with other treatments is needed, including follow-up to determine relapse rates.
there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of high dose chemotherapy with autograft for women with early poor prognosis breast cancer.
ginkgo biloba appears to be safe in use with no excess side effects compared with placebo. many of the early trials used unsatisfactory methods, were small, and publication bias cannot be excluded. the evidence that ginkgo biloba has predictable and clinically significant benefit for people with dementia or cognitive impairment is inconsistent and unreliable.
there is evidence that laparoscopic fundoplication surgery is more effective than medical management for the treatment of gord at least in the short to medium term. surgery does carry some risk and whether the benefits of surgery are sustained in the long term remains uncertain. treatment decisions for gord should be based on patient and surgeon preference.
overall, there is currently insufficient evidence from these trials to support the administration of corticosteroids to patients with idiopathic acute vestibular dysfunction. we found no trials with a low risk of methodological bias that used the highest level of diagnostic criteria and outcome measures. we recommend that future studies should include health-related quality of life and symptom-based outcome measures, in addition to objective measures of vestibular improvement, such as caloric testing and electronystagmography.
there is insufficient evidence to conclude whether slings and wheelchair attachments prevent subluxation, decrease pain, increase function or adversely increase contracture in the shoulder after stroke. there is some evidence that strapping the shoulder delays the onset of pain but does not decrease it, nor does it increase function or adversely increase contracture.
these results suggest that calcium channel blockers given in the peri-operative period may reduce the incidence of atn post-transplantation. the result should be treated with caution due to the heterogeneity of the trials which made comparison of studies and pooling of data difficult.
medically stable preterm infants can be transferred to unheated open cots at a lower body weight of 1600 grams without adverse effects on temperature stability or weight gain. earlier transfer does not necessarily result in earlier discharge.
glatiramer acetate did show a partial efficacy in rr ms in term of relapse -related clinical outcomes, without any significant effect on clinical progression of disease measured as sustained disability. the drug is not effective in progressive ms patients.
the effect of antifibrinolytic drugs on mortality could not be assessed. antifibrinolytic drugs reduced blood loss and the amount of blood transfused in children undergoing scoliosis surgery; however, their effect on the number of children requiring blood transfusion remains unclear. aprotinin, tranexamic acid and aminocaproic acid seem to be similarly effective.
there is no evidence from randomised trials to support the routine use of early volume expansion in very preterm infants without cardiovascular compromise. there is insufficient evidence to determine whether infants with cardiovascular compromise benefit from volume expansion. there is insufficient evidence to determine what type of volume expansion should be used in preterm infants (if at all) or to determine the benefit of using early red cell transfusions. the significance of the finding of a significant increase in blood pressure in hypotensive preterm infants in one trial comparing albumin and saline is unclear, but the overall meta-analyses found no other significant clinical benefit in using albumin compared to saline.
there is evidence that a simple prompt to attend clinic, very close to the time of the appointment may encourage attendance, and a simple orientation-type letter may be more effective than a telephone prompt. this simple intervention could be a more cost effective means of encouraging compliance at first attendance, but supplementing these data with the results of large, well designed, conducted and reported randomised studies would be desirable.
topical steroid is a beneficial treatment for crs without polyps and the adverse effects are minor. it may be included in a comprehensive treatment of crs without polyps. direct delivery of steroid to the sinuses may bring more beneficial effect. further studies comparing different topical drug delivery methods to the sinuses, with appropriate treatment duration (longer than 12 weeks), are required.
there is weak evidence from one small trial that 6% miltefosine solution applied topically to people with superficial fungating breast lesions (smaller than 1cm) who have received either previous radiotherapy, surgery, hormonal therapy or chemotherapy for their breast cancer, may slow disease progression. there is insufficient evidence in this review to give a clear direction for practice with regard to improving quality of life or managing wound symptoms associated with fungating wounds. more research is needed.
the results of this review show that phenobarbitone was significantly more likely to be withdrawn than phenytoin. given that no significant differences for seizure outcomes were found, the higher withdrawal rate with phenobarbitone may be due to adverse effects. several factors may have confounded the results of this review.
prophylactic penicillin significantly reduces risk of pneumococcal infection in children with homozygous sickle cell disease, and is associated with minimal adverse reactions. further research may help to determine the ideal age to safely withdraw penicillin.
given the generally poor quality of the published studies and the large degree of heterogeneity in the interventions and the results, the overall benefit of pentoxifylline for patients with fontaine class ii intermittent claudication remains uncertain. pentoxifylline is generally well tolerated. based on the totality of the available evidence, it is possible that pentoxifylline could have a place in the treatment of ic as a means of improving walking distance and as a complimentary treatment assuming all other essential measures such as lifestyle change, exercise and treatment for secondary prevention have been taken into account. however, the response to pentoxifylline should be assessed on an individual basis.
propofol for sedation during colonoscopy for generally healthy individuals can lead to faster recovery and discharge times, increased patient satisfaction without an increase in side-effects. for the comparison of propofol administration by anaesthesiologists to that by non-anesthesiologists, we found insufficient high quality evidence. there is a need for better quality studies, with double blind randomizations, reporting of allocation concealment and more standardized reporting of outcomes.
a single 30 mg dose of dihydrocodeine is not sufficient to provide adequate pain relief in postoperative pain. statistical superiority of ibuprofen 400 mg over dihydrocodeine (30 mg or 60 mg) was shown. since the last version of this review no new relevant studies have been identified.
only three trials with a short follow-up duration were found. there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of silver-containing dressings or topical agents for treatment of infected or contaminated chronic wounds.
rutosides appear to help relieve the symptoms of varicose veins in late pregnancy. however, this finding is based on one small study (69 women) and there are not enough data presented in the study to assess its safety in pregnancy. it therefore cannot be routinely recommended. reflexology appears to help improve symptoms for women with leg oedema, but again this is based on one small study (43 women). external compression stockings do not appear to have any advantages in reducing oedema.
there is insufficient information available from randomised controlled trials on which to base clinical decisions regarding the optimal method of induction of labour in women with a prior caesarean birth.
when tocolysis is indicated for women in preterm labour, calcium channel blockers are preferable to other tocolytic agents compared, mainly betamimetics. further research should address the effects of different dosage regimens and formulations of calcium channel blockers on maternal and neonatal outcomes. [note: the 39 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
postnatal administration of phenobarbital cannot be recommended as prophylaxis to prevent ivh in preterm infants and is associated with an increased need for mechanical ventilation.
evidence on whether zinc supplementation can reduce the incidence of om in healthy children under the age of five years living in low- and middle-income countries is mixed. there is some evidence of benefit in children being treated for marasmus (severe malnutrition) but this is based on one small trial and should therefore be treated with caution.
there was a smaller displacement of the cemented tibial component in relation to the cementless fixation in studies with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis participants who underwent primary total knee prosthesis with a follow-up of two years; however, the cemented fixation presented a greater risk of future aseptic loosening than cementless fixation.
relatively few randomized trials have been published on aqueous shunts and methodology and data quality among them is poor. to date there is no evidence of superiority of one shunt over another.
data from rcts comparing ias to cas are limited by small sample size and short duration. there are no data for the relative effectiveness of ias versus cas for overall survival, prostate cancer-specific survival, or disease progression. limited information suggests ias may have slightly reduced adverse events. overall, ias was also as effective as cas for potency, but was superior during the interval of cycles (96%).
our results confirm that pdis are responsible for an increase in mortality rate compared with placebo in patients suffering from chronic heart failure. currently available results do not support the hypothesis that the increased mortality rate is due to additional vasodilator treatment. consequently, the chronic use of pdis should be avoided in heart failure patients.
available evidence showed that rosuvastatin was associated with a reduced incidence of vte, but the evidence was limited to a single rct. randomised controlled trials of statins (including rosuvastatin) are needed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in the prevention of vte.
paediatric oncology patients receiving chemotherapy are able to generate an immune response to the influenza vaccine, but it remains unclear whether this immune response protects them from influenza infection or its complications. we are awaiting results from well-designed rcts addressing the clinical benefit of influenza vaccination in these patients.
oral therapy appears to be an effective and safe alternative to parenteral antibiotics in hospitalised children with severe pneumonia who do not have any serious signs or symptoms.
the provision of recordings or summaries of key consultations may benefit most adults with cancer. although more research is needed to improve our understanding of these interventions, most patients find them very useful. practitioners should consider offering people recordings or written summaries of their consultations
though recurrence in the remaining liver happened less in the hepatic artery chemotherapy group, overall survival was not improved, and even favoured the control group, though not significantly. this added intervention cannot be recommended at this time.
there is some evidence from one study at high risk of bias that topical glyceryl trinitrate is more effective than placebo for rotator cuff disease among patients with acute symptoms (< seven-days duration), but there is insufficient evidence to be certain about their longer-term effects. headache was a common side effect in one trial and any benefits of treatment need to be balanced against the risk of headache. further high quality research is needed to determine the effectiveness and safety of this new therapy.
there is little evidence to support the use of one particular form of insulin administration over another for pregnant women with diabetes. the data are few, there are only a small number of trials appropriate for meta-analysis, a small number of women included and questionable generalisability of the trial population. conclusions cannot be made from the available data. well-designed randomised trials are needed. these trials should be adequately powered to assess the effect of csii versus mdi on important outcomes for women with diabetes and their infants.
prophylactic antibiotics reduce bacteriaemia and seem to prevent cholangitis and septicaemia in patients undergoing elective ercp. in the subgroup of patients with uncomplicated ercp, the effect of antibiotics may be less evident. further research is required to determine whether antibiotics can be given during or after an ercp if it becomes apparent that biliary obstruction cannot be relieved during that procedure.
we found evidence favouring the corticosteroid mp for acute exacerbation in ms patients. data are insufficient to reliably estimate effect of corticosteroids on prevention of new exacerbations and reduction of long-term disability.studies assessing long term risk/benefit and adverse effects of corticosteroids in ms patients are urgently needed.
there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of nerve interruption in the management of dysmenorrhoea, regardless of cause. future methodologically sound and sufficiently powered rcts should be undertaken.
there is an absence of evidence, from rcts, that occlusal adjustment treats or prevents tmd. occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the management or prevention of tmd. future trials should use standardised diagnostic criteria and outcome measures when evaluating tmd.
there should be a balanced consideration between the benefits of topical fluorides in caries prevention and the risk of the development of fluorosis. most of the available evidence focuses on mild fluorosis. there is weak unreliable evidence that starting the use of fluoride toothpaste in children under 12 months of age may be associated with an increased risk of fluorosis. the evidence for its use between the age of 12 and 24 months is equivocal. if the risk of fluorosis is of concern, the fluoride level of toothpaste for young children (under 6 years of age) is recommended to be lower than 1000 parts per million (ppm). more evidence with low risk of bias is needed. future trials assessing the effectiveness of different types of topical fluorides (including toothpastes, gels, varnishes and mouthrinses) or different concentrations or both should ensure that they include an adequate follow-up period in order to collect data on potential fluorosis. as it is unethical to propose rcts to assess fluorosis itself, it is acknowledged that further observational studies will be undertaken in this area. however, attention needs to be given to the choice of study design, bearing in mind that prospective, controlled studies will be less susceptible to bias than retrospective and/or uncontrolled studies.
there is insufficient evidence from randomised trials to support or refute the use of prophylactic antibiotics when uvcs are inserted in newborn infants. there is no evidence to support or refute continuing antibiotics once initial cultures rule out infection in newborn infants with uvcs.
differences in the need for rescue or other analgesia could not be detected between caudal, parenteral and penile block methods. in day-case surgery, penile block may be preferable to caudal block in children old enough to walk due to the possibility of temporary leg weakness after caudal block. evidence from trials is limited by small numbers and poor methodology. there is a need for properly designed trials comparing caudal epidural block with other methods such as morphine, simple analgesics and topical local anaesthetic creams, emulsions or gels.
there is clear evidence of a caries-inhibiting effect of fluoride gel. the best estimate of the magnitude of this effect, based on the 14 placebo-controlled trials, is a 21% reduction (95% ci, 14% to 28%) in d(m)fs. this corresponds to an nnt of 2 (95% ci, 1 to 3) to avoid 1 d(m)fs in a population with a caries increment of 2.2 d(m)fs/year, or an nnt of 24 (95% ci, 18 to 36) based on an increment of 0.2 d(m)fs/year. there is little information concerning the deciduous dentition, on adverse effects or on acceptability of treatment. future trials should include assessment of potential adverse effects.
overall, there is little evidence that pufa supplementation provides any benefit for the symptoms of adhd in children and adolescents. the majority of data showed no benefit of pufa supplementation, although there were some limited data that did show an improvement with combined omega-3 and omega-6 supplementation. it is important that future research addresses current weaknesses in this area, which include small sample sizes, variability of selection criteria, variability of the type and dosage of supplementation, short follow-up times and other methodological weaknesses.
in conclusion, this meta-analysis shows that treatment with vitamin k antagonists reduces the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism for as long as it is used. however, the absolute risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism declines over time, while the risk for major bleeding remains. thus, the efficacy of vitamin k antagonist administration decreases over time since the index event.
evidence from a small number of trials suggests that dipyrone is effective for etth and migraine. no serious adverse events were observed in the included trials, but agranulocytosis is rare and would probably not be observed in such a relatively small sample. a study now ongoing in latin america may clarify the true risk of agranulocytosis associated with dipyrone use.
the risk of bias was high in most of the included trials and poor reporting quality and inadequate data did not permit comprehensive and reliable conclusions to be made. future trials should be well-constructed and pay more attention to the methods used to assess outcomes, the timing of the assessments, and the quality of reporting and subsequent analysis of the data.
we found insufficient evidence that hormonal treatment in any form, dose or as part of combination therapy improves the survival of patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer. however, a large number of patients would be needed to demonstrate an effect on survival and none of the included rcts had a sufficient number of patients to demonstrate a significant difference. in the absence of a proven survival advantage and the heterogeneity of patient populations, the decision to use any type of hormonal therapy should be individualised and with the intent to palliate the disease. it is debatable whether outcomes such as quality of life, treatment response or palliative measures such as relieving symptoms should take preference over overall and pfs as the major objectives of future trials.
there is currently no evidence for the use of nsaids in the secondary prevention of pd. non-aspirin nsaids, particularly ibuprofen, may reduce the risk of developing pd. however, little is known of the effects of other individual drugs and at present no recommendations can be made regarding their use in primary prevention.
harpagophytum procumbens, salix alba and capsicum frutescens seem to reduce pain more than placebo. additional trials testing these herbal medicines against standard treatments are needed. the quality of reporting in these trials was generally poor. trialists should refer to the consort statement extension for reporting trials of herbal medicine interventions.
there is no clear benefit of using b2-agonists in the management of recurrent wheeze in the first two years of life although there is conflicting evidence. at present, further studies should only be performed if the patient group can be clearly defined and there is a suitable outcome parameter capable of measuring a response.
the prone position was found to slightly improve the oxygenation in neonates undergoing mechanical ventilation. however, we found no evidence concerning whether particular body positions during the mechanical ventilation of the neonate are effective in producing sustained and clinically relevant improvements.
there is a need for well-designed randomised controlled trials to evaluate the role of acupuncture to induce labour and for trials to assess clinically meaningful outcomes. [note: the 15 citations in the awaiting classification section of the review may alter the conclusions of the review once assessed.]
based on one low quality trial, the medicinal herb 'jianpi wenshen recipe' may have an antiviral activity in asymptomatic carriers of hepatitis b virus. however, rigorous randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are needed before herbs should be used for this condition.
the data from the present meta-analysis indicate that tumour recurrence was significantly reduced with intravesical bcg compared to mmc only in the subgroup of patients at high risk of tumour recurrence. however, there was no difference in terms of disease progression or survival, and the decision to use either agent might be based on adverse events and cost.
we conclude that there appears to be little scientific evidence for the effectiveness of multidisciplinary rehabilitation for these musculoskeletal disorders. however, multidisciplinary rehabilitation is a commonly used intervention for chronic musculoskeletal disorders, which cause much personal suffering and substantial economic loss to the society. there is a need for high quality trials in this field.
there is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of otc medicines in acute cough. the results of this review have to be interpreted with caution due to differences in study characteristics and quality. studies often showed conflicting results with uncertainty regarding clinical relevance. higher quality evidence is needed to determine the effectiveness of self care treatments for acute cough.
the existing literature does not support the efficacy of type i ifns for induction of remission in patients with uc. given concerns regarding the tolerability of ifn therapy, we suggest that the results of two ongoing trials are evaluated for efficacy and safety prior to development or commencement of further randomised controlled trials of type i ifns in uc.
the pooled analyses suggest that peg preparations may be superior to placebo, lactulose and milk of magnesia for childhood constipation. grade analyses indicated that the overall quality of the evidence for the primary outcome (number of stools per week) was low or very low due to sparse data, inconsistency (heterogeneity), and high risk of bias in the studies in the pooled analyses. thus, the results of the pooled analyses should be interpreted with caution because of quality and methodological concerns, as well as clinical heterogeneity, and short follow up. however, peg appears safe and well tolerated. there is also evidence suggesting the efficacy of liquid paraffin (mineral oil), which was also well tolerated.there is no evidence to demonstrate the superiority of lactulose when compared to the other agents studied, although there is a lack of placebo controlled studies. further research is needed to investigate the long term use of peg for childhood constipation, as well as the role of liquid paraffin.
loxapine is an antipsychotic which is not clearly distinct from typical or atypical drugs in terms of its effects on global or mental state. loxapines profile of adverse effects is similar to that of the older generation of antipsychotic drugs.
lipid-lowering therapy is effective in reducing cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in people with pad. it may also improve local symptoms. until further evidence on the relative effectiveness of different lipid-lowering agents is available, use of a statin in people with pad and a blood cholesterol level ≥ 3.5 mmol/litre is most indicated.
this review shows that xpert used as an initial diagnostic test for tb detection and rifampicin resistance detection in patients suspected of having tb, mdr-tb, or hiv-associated tb is sensitive and specific. xpert may also be valuable as an add-on test following microscopy for patients who have previously been found to be smear-negative. an xpert result that is positive for rifampicin resistance should be carefully interpreted and take into consideration the risk of mdr-tb in a given patient and the expected prevalence of mdr-tb in a given setting. studies in this review mainly assessed sensitivity and specificity of the test when used in reference laboratories in research investigations. most studies were performed in high tb burden countries. ongoing use of xpert in high tb burden countries will contribute to the evidence base on the diagnostic accuracy and clinical impact of xpert in routine programmatic and peripheral health care settings, including settings where the test is performed at the point of care.
there is no evidence to support the use of iv beta2-agonists in patients with severe acute asthma. these drugs should be given by inhalation. no subgroups were identified in which the iv route should be considered.
psychological interventions and pharmacological interventions with ssris may have a small yet clinically meaningful effect on depression outcomes in cad patients. no beneficial effects on the reduction of mortality rates and cardiac events were found. overall, however, the evidence is sparse due to the low number of high quality trials per outcome and the heterogeneity of examined populations and interventions.
due to the generally low methodological quality and small sample size of the included trials in this systematic review, we could not draw a firm conclusion.
we could demonstrate a benefit of systemic prophylactic antibiotics for the first 24 hours postoperatively to prevent shunt infection, regardless of the patient's age and the type of internal shunt used. the benefit of its use after this period remains uncertain. however this data derives from the rate of shunt infection, which is an intermediary outcome. future trials should evaluate the effectiveness of different regimens of systemic antibiotics rather than placebo, and should include all-cause mortality, shunt revision and adverse events as additional outcomes. evidence suggests that antibiotic-impregnated catheters reduce the incidence of shunt infection although more well-designed clinical trials testing the effect of antibiotic-impregnated shunts are required to confirm their net benefit.
these findings provide some modest support for the use of fetal st waveform analysis when a decision has been made to undertake continuous electronic fetal heart rate monitoring during labour. however, the advantages need to be considered along with the disadvantages of needing to use an internal scalp electrode, after membrane rupture, for ecg waveform recordings.
interferon alfa is effective in improving biochemical outcomes and achieving sustained virologic clearance in patients with transfusion-acquired acute hepatitis c. the effect on long-term clinical outcomes could not be assessed due to limitations in the current data.
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaid) including aspirin were better than placebo at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth. nsaids were better than paracetamol and paracetamol was not better than placebo, though numbers of participants for these comparisons were small. data for opioids compared with nsaids and opioids compared with placebo were conflicting, with some measures showing similar effect and others indicating nsaids were better than opioids and opioids were not better than placebo. there were insufficient data to make conclusions regarding the effectiveness of opioids at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution. the median year of publication of included studies was 1981; therefore more research is needed to assess the effectiveness of current pharmacological and non-pharmacological analgesia at relieving pain from uterine cramping/involution following vaginal birth.
based on the evidence, aerobic capacity training combined with muscle strength training is recommended as routine practice in patients with ra.
there is only limited evidence to support the use of progestagens and anti-progestagens for pain associated with endometriosis.
carmustine impregnated wafers (gliadel®) result in improved survival without an increased incidence of adverse events over placebo wafers when used for primary disease therapy. there is no evidence of benefit for any other outcome measures. in recurrent disease gliadel® does not appear to confer any additional benefit.
sulpiride may be an effective antipsychotic drug but evidence is limited and data relating to claims for its value against negative symptoms is not trial-based.
there is no evidence of benefit of ultrasound therapy in the treatment of pressure ulcers. however, the possibility of beneficial or harmful effect cannot be ruled out due to the small number of trials, some with methodological limitations and small numbers of participants. further research is needed.
the evidence does not suggest a significant reduction in mortality, measures of morbidity, nor an effect on the clinical course of pneumonia with vitamin a adjunctive treatment in children with non-measles pneumonia. however, not all studies measured all outcomes, which limited the number of studies that could be incorporated into the meta-analyses, so that there may have been a lack of statistical power to detect statistically significant differences.
randomised studies are possible in this field. the use of psychosocial interventions for conversion disorder requires more research and it is not possible to draw any conclusions about their potential benefits or harms from the included studies.
the pooled estimates suggest that antibiotic prophylaxis might be prudent among cirrhotic patients with ascites and no gastrointestinal bleeding. however, poor trial methodology and report coupled with findings suggesting systematic bias in publication and design reflect the fragility of these findings. potential hazard to society and the patients themselves from resistant pathogens should be considered when promoting long-lasting antibiotic prophylaxis. it seems that recommending antibiotic prophylaxis is still far from being a substantiated prevention strategy. trials of better design, well reported, and of longer follow-up are greatly needed.
infants with nas due to opiate withdrawal should receive initial treatment with an opiate. where a sedative is used, phenobarbitone should be used in preference to diazepam. in infants treated with an opiate, the addition of phenobarbitone or clonidine may reduce withdrawal severity. further studies are needed to determine the role of sedatives in infants with nas due to opiate withdrawal and the safety and efficacy of adding phenobarbitone or clonidine in infants treated with an opiate for nas.
endoscopic laser coagulation of anastomotic vessels should be considered in the treatment of all stages of twin-twin transfusion syndrome to improve perinatal outcome. further research on the effect of treatment on milder forms of twin-twin transfusion syndrome (quintero stage 1 and 2) are required. the long-term outcomes of survivors from the studies included in this review are required.
there is evidence for the effectiveness of psychological therapies, particularly cbt, for treating ptsd in children and adolescents for up to a month following treatment. at this stage, there is no clear evidence for the effectiveness of one psychological therapy compared to others. there is also not enough evidence to conclude that children and adolescents with particular types of trauma are more or less likely to respond to psychological therapies than others. the findings of this review are limited by the potential for methodological biases, and the small number and generally small size of identified studies. in addition, there was evidence of substantial heterogeneity in some analyses which could not be explained by subgroup or sensitivity analyses. more evidence is required for the effectiveness of all psychological therapies more than one month after treatment. much more evidence is needed to demonstrate the relative effectiveness of different psychological therapies or the effectiveness of psychological therapies compared to other treatments. more details are required in future trials in regards to the types of trauma that preceded the diagnosis of ptsd and whether the traumas are single event or ongoing. future studies should also aim to identify the most valid and reliable measures of ptsd symptoms and ensure that all scores, total and sub-scores, are consistently reported.
sublingual nitroglycerin, given when oxytocin fails, seems to reduce both the need for manual removal of placenta and blood loss during the third stage of labour when compared to placebo. further trials are needed to confirm its clinical role and safety. its routine use cannot be recommended based on a single small study. there is no evidence available for other types of tocolytics.
summary estimates from 12 small studies of moderate to good quality that included predominantly copd patients demonstrated a consistent, positive effect on mortality and ventilator associated pneumonia. the net clinical benefits associated with noninvasive weaning remain to be fully elucidated.
overall, there is insufficient evidence to draw definitive conclusions on the best type of, or technique for, intramedullary nailing for tibial shaft fractures in adults. 'moderate' quality evidence suggests that there is no clear difference in the rate of major re-operations and complications between reamed and unreamed intramedullary nailing. reamed intramedullary nailing has, however, a lower incidence of implant failure than unreamed nailing. 'low' quality evidence suggests that reamed nailing may reduce the incidence of major re-operations related to non-union in closed fractures rather than in open fractures. 'low' quality evidence suggests that the ender nail has poorer results in terms of re-operation and malunion than an interlocking nail.
sertindole at a dose of 20mg/day was found to be more antipsychotic than placebo. when used at 8, 12 or 20mg/day it appears to be as acceptable as placebo (in terms of various adverse events including movement disorders and somnolence), but seems to be associated with more cardiac problems (8, 12 or 20mg/day) and an increase in weight gain (20mg/day) than placebo. sertindole at a dose of 24mg/day was better tolerated than haloperidol (in terms of participants leaving the study early). it was also found to be was associated with fewer movement disorders (at 8, 16, 20 or 24mg/day) and sedation (8 or 24mg/day) than haloperidol. however, it was shown to cause more cardiac anomalies (16, 20 or 24mg/day), weight gain (all doses combined), rhinitis (16 or 24mg/day), and problems with sexual functioning (24mg/day) than haloperidol. one short term study reported that sertindole 16mg/day was the most optimal dose.
this review demonstrates the superiority of epinephrine compared to placebo for short-term outcomes for outpatients, particularly in the first 24 hours of care. exploratory evidence from a single study suggests benefits of epinephrine and steroid combined for later time points. more research is required to confirm the benefits of combined epinephrine and steroids among outpatients. there is no evidence of effectiveness for repeated dose or prolonged use of epinephrine or epinephrine and dexamethasone combined among inpatients.
post extubation atelectasis may be more frequent after nasal intubation, particularly in very low birth weight infants. one route of intubation does not seem to be preferable to the other. there is a need for further randomized controlled trials containing larger numbers of infants.
results suggest that there is insufficient trial evidence to justify using any psychological intervention for adults with aspd. disappointingly few of the included studies addressed the primary outcomes defined in this review (aggression, reconviction, global functioning, social functioning, adverse effects). three interventions (contingency management with standard maintenance; cbt with standard maintenance; 'driving whilst intoxicated program' with incarceration) appeared effective, compared to the control condition, in terms of improvement in at least one outcome in at least one study. each of these interventions had been originally developed for people with substance misuse problems. significant improvements were mainly confined to outcomes related to substance misuse. no study reported significant change in any specific antisocial behaviour. further research is urgently needed for this prevalent and costly condition.
evidence on various anti-hypertensive drugs in people with pad is poor so that it is unknown whether significant benefits or risks accrue from their use. lack of data specifically examining outcomes in pad patients should not detract from the compelling evidence of the benefit of treating hypertension and lowering blood pressure.
conventional cooling methods to induce mild therapeutic hypothermia seem to improve survival and neurologic outcome after cardiac arrest. our review supports the current best medical practice as recommended by the international resuscitation guidelines.
preoperative statin therapy reduces the odds of post-operative af and shortens the stay on the icu and in the hospital. statin pretreatment had no influence on perioperative mortality, stroke, myocardial infarction or renal failure. since analysed studies included mainly patients undergoing myocardial revascularizations the results cannot be extrapolated to patients undergoing other cardiac procedures such as heart valve or aortic surgery.
there is insufficient evidence to recommend probiotic therapy as an adjunct to antibiotic therapy for c. difficile colitis. there is no evidence to support the use of probiotics alone in the treatment of c. difficile colitis.
evidence does not indicate that abstinence-only interventions effectively decrease or exacerbate hiv risk among participants in high-income countries; trials suggest that the programs are ineffective, but generalizability may be limited to us youth. should funding continue, additional resources could support rigorous evaluations with behavioral or biological outcomes. more trials comparing abstinence-only and abstinence-plus interventions are needed.
patients undergoing infrainguinal venous graft are more likely to benefit from treatment with vka than platelet inhibitors. patients receiving an artificial graft benefit from platelet inhibitors (aspirin). however, the evidence is not conclusive. randomised controlled trials with larger patient numbers are needed in the future to compare antithrombotic therapies with either placebo or antiplatelet therapies.
there is evidence that supportive interventions may help reduce caregivers' psychological distress. these findings suggest that practitioners should enquire about the concerns of caregivers and should consider that they may benefit from additional support. there is, however, a need for further research to explore the benefits identified, and to assess the interventions' effects on physical health, and potential harms. trials need to report their methods fully.
the evidence from this review of 21 randomised controlled trials did not support one particular method or technique over another in providing effective conscious sedation and analgesia for pain relief during and after oocyte recovery. the simultaneous use of more than one method of sedation and pain relief resulted in better pain relief than one modality alone. the various approaches and techniques reviewed appeared to be acceptable and were associated with a high degree of satisfaction in women. as women vary in their experience of pain and in coping strategies, the optimal method may be individualised depending on the preferences of both the women and the clinicians and resource availability.
further adequately powered, well designed rcts are needed to confirm the efficacy of cyclosporin and to evaluate other regimens for idiopathic srns including high dose steroids with cyclosporin.
there is low evidence, at the present, supporting the clinical use of disulfiram for the treatment of cocaine dependence. larger randomised investigations are needed investigating relevant outcomes and reporting data to allow comparisons of results between studies. results from ongoing studies will be added as soon as their results will be available.
there is moderate quality evidence that corticosteroids given acutely during zoster infection are ineffective in preventing postherpetic neuralgia. in people with acute herpes zoster the risks of administration of corticosteroids do not appear to be greater than with placebo, based on moderate quality evidence. corticosteroids have been recommended to relieve the zoster-associated pain in the acute phase of disease. if further research is designed to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for herpes zoster, long-term follow-up should be included to observe their effect on the transition from acute pain to postherpetic neuralgia. future trials should include measurements of function and quality of life.
current evidence does not support a clinically relevant effect of systemic or inhaled glucocorticoids on admissions or length of hospitalisation. combined dexamethasone and epinephrine may reduce outpatient admissions, but results are exploratory and safety data limited. future research should further assess the efficacy, harms and applicability of combined therapy.
meta-analysis demonstrates that topiramate in a 100 mg/day dosage is effective in reducing headache frequency and reasonably well-tolerated in adult patients with episodic migraine. this provides good evidence to support its use in routine clinical management. more studies designed specifically to compare the efficacy or safety of topiramate versus other interventions with proven efficacy in the prophylaxis of migraine are needed.
currently there is no research evidence to suggest that alginate wound dressings are more effective in healing foot ulcers in people with diabetes than other types of dressing however many trials in this field are very small. decision makers may wish to consider aspects such as dressing cost and the wound management properties offered by each dressing type e.g. exudate management.
in keeping with previous world health organization (who) recommendations everything possible should be done to promote and support adequate dietary intake of micronutrients, while recognising that this may not be sufficient to correct specific micronutrient deficiencies in all hiv-infected individuals. specific recommendations for pregnant and lactating women infected with hiv would be to include the provision of multivitamin supplements in single rda formulations during the antenatal period and at least for 6 weeks post-partum, especially for women who are breast-feeding. there is no conclusive evidence to provide stand-alone zinc or selenium supplementation to hiv-infected pregnant and lactating women. micronutrient supplementation should not be used as a substitute for provision of recommended antiretroviral medication for preventing mother-to-child transmission of hiv and treating maternal hiv infection when this is recommended. further trials of single supplements are required to build the evidence base. the long-term clinical benefits, adverse effects, and optimal formulation of multiple micronutrient supplements require further investigation in pregnant women at different stages of hiv infection.
we failed to find any clear evidence that the addition of immunotherapy to chemotherapy increases survival of people with metastatic melanoma. further use of combined immunotherapy and chemotherapy should only be done in the context of clinical trials.
data from one small study suggest that using a percutaneous central venous catheter to deliver parenteral nutrition improves nutrient input. the significance of this in relation to long-term growth and developmental outcomes is unclear. three studies suggested that the use of a percutaneous central venous catheter decreases the number of catheters/cannulae needed to deliver the nutrition. no evidence was found to suggest that percutaneous central venous catheter use increased the risk of adverse events, particularly systemic infection.
salbutamol was no different from placebo in reducing the frequency of cough measured objectively or scored subjectively.
interferon alpha does not seem to cure hepatitis d in most patients. the agent seems effective in suppressing viral and liver disease activity in some patients, but this improvement is not sustained in the majority of patients. we cannot exclude overestimation of benefits and underestimation of harms due to high risk of bias (systematic errors) and high risk play of chance (random errors). therefore, more randomised trials with large sample sizes and less risk of bias are needed before interferon can be recommended or refuted.
we identified eligible trials on quetiapine, risperidone and olanzapine. the available data on olanzapine and risperidone are too limited to draw any conclusions. monotherapy with quetiapine seems to be efficacious in reducing symptoms of generalised anxiety disorder and this effect may be similar to that of antidepressants. however, quetiapine's efficacy must be weighed against its lower tolerability.
there is no high quality evidence to support significant benefit or harm from any physical therapy for idiopathic facial paralysis. there is low quality evidence that tailored facial exercises can help to improve facial function, mainly for people with moderate paralysis and chronic cases. there is low quality evidence that facial exercise reduces sequelae in acute cases. the suggested effects of tailored facial exercises need to be confirmed with good quality randomised controlled trials.
we know very little of the effects of these drugs regarding service outcomes, general functioning and behaviours, engagement with services and treatment satisfaction from evaluative studies. there was generally a high rate of attrition in the trials and there appears to be little to differentiate between risperidone and olanzapine except on issues of adverse effects. both drugs are associated with a reduction in psychotic symptoms but both commonly cause unpleasant adverse effects.
insufficient evidence exists from randomised trials to confirm the relative effects of open versus closed reduction of intracapsular fractures, or the effects of intra-operative impaction or compression of an intracapsular fracture treated by internal fixation.
a single injection cycle of bta is effective and safe for treating cervical dystonia. enriched trials (using patients previously treated with bta), suggest that further injection cycles continue to work for most patients.
laparoscopic and small-incision cholecystectomy seem to be equivalent. no differences could be observed in mortality, complications, and postoperative recovery. small-incision cholecystectomy has a significantly shorter operative time. complications in elective cholecystectomy are prevalent.
there is no convincing evidence that either maternal postpartum or infant vitamin a supplementation results in a reduction in infant mortality or morbidity in low and middle income countries.
there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the effectiveness of conventional fillings over crowns for the restoration of root filled teeth. until more evidence becomes available clinicians should continue to base decisions on how to restore root filled teeth on their own clinical experience, whilst taking into consideration the individual circumstances and preferences of their patients.
most studies to date have shown no benefit of strategies to improve adherence and continuation. these trials have important limitations, however. three had small sample sizes, four had high losses to follow up, and the intervention and its intensity varied across the studies. high-quality research is a priority, since adherence and continuation are fundamentally important to the successful use of hormonal contraceptives.
one definition of active management includes directions to administer an uterotonic with birth of the anterior shoulder of the baby and to clamp the umbilical cord within 30-60 seconds of birth of the baby (which is not always feasible in practice). in this review delaying clamping of the cord for at least two to three minutes seems not to increase the risk of postpartum haemorrhage. in addition, late cord clamping can be advantageous for the infant by improving iron status which may be of clinical value particularly in infants where access to good nutrition is poor, although delaying clamping increases the risk of jaundice requiring phototherapy.
the evidence from randomised controlled trials so far does not confirm or refute that water-based exercises after stroke might help to reduce disability after stroke. there is a lack of hard evidence for water-based exercises after stroke. better and larger studies are therefore required.
this review shows that the presence of parents during induction of general anaesthesia does not reduce their child's anxiety. promising non-pharmacological interventions such as parental acupuncture; clown doctors; hypnotherapy; low sensory stimulation; and hand-held video games needs to be investigated further.
the use of intracameral unpreserved 1% lidocaine is an effective and safe adjunct to topical anaesthesia for phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
from the evidence available, the routine use of traction (either skin or skeletal) prior to surgery for a hip fracture does not appear to have any benefit. however, the evidence is also insufficient to rule out the potential advantages for traction, in particular for specific fracture types, or to confirm additional complications due to traction use. given the increasing lack of evidence for the use of pre-operative traction, the onus should now be on clinicians who persist in using pre-operative traction to either stop using it or to use it only in the context of a well-designed randomised controlled trial.
the available evidence shows that intramedullary nailing is associated with an increased risk of shoulder impingement, with a related increase in restriction of shoulder movement and need for removal of metalwork. there was insufficient evidence to determine if there were any other important differences, including in functional outcome, between dynamic compression plating and locked intramedullary nailing for humeral shaft fractures.
antibiotics reduce the incidence of early infections in open fractures of the limbs. further placebo controlled randomised trials are unlikely to be justified in middle and high income countries, except for open fractures of the fingers. further research is necessary to the determine the avoidable burden of morbidity in countries where antibiotics are not used routinely in the management of open fractures.
